The organization will be required to meet the deficiencies within the prescribed time frame by preparing necessary action programs in this regard.
(a) The method of distribution of funds:
After the administrative approval for the projects in the Maharashtra Golden Jubilee Urban Mission, the concerned civic body should submit the financial closure report of the project to the Urban Development Department. The first installment of the project will be released after the completion of the project.
After disbursing the first installment of funds to the projects approved under the Maharashtra Golden Jubilee Urban Mission, it will be mandatory to open a separate account in the banks prescribed by the government as per the prevailing policy of the government.
While setting up self-financing funds for projects approved under the Maharashtra Suvarna Jayanti Nagarotna Abhiyan, the urban local bodies will be required to converge with the 14th Finance Commission (Fundamental and Functional) grants received from the state government. For this, it will be mandatory for them to mark the funds received from it.
The second instalment of the State Government will be disbursed only after the utilization certificate of 70% of the total amount of the first instalment of subsidy disbursed by the State Government and the first instalment of self-assurance deposited by the Urban Local Body is submitted to the Government through the Directorate of Municipal Administration.
Urban Local Bodies should submit a proposal to the Government through the Directorate of Municipal Administration to demand the second installment. The Directorate of Municipal Administration should scrutinize the proposals and submit them to the government with appropriate feedback.
After the State Government approves the share of the State Government to the concerned local body for the project approved under this mission, the local body concerned should provide the amount of self-assurance from the State Government's account at each stage of the expenditure. With this, there will be no time to pay the share of the local body in such a scheme at once.
The funds sanctioned by the State Government for the projects sanctioned under the Maharashtra Suvarna Jayanti Nagrothan Mahabhiyana can be used only for that project and cannot be diverted or used for any other work. Any such diversion of the principal amount or interest thereon, whether permanent or temporary, will be treated as a serious financial irregularity for which action will be taken by the concerned local bodies/ authorities concerned.
(d) the tender process, the work order and the implementation:
Under this campaign, it will be mandatory to tender the approved project within 7 days of administrative approval and to give work orders within three months and to start the work physically before the 101st day. The project is being implemented by the city corporation. Therefore, the entire responsibility of complying with this deadline will be of the Chief Officer, Digras Municipal Council and Maharashtra Life Authority.
