Government Resolution No. MCO-2018/ No.73/ NO.14,
The main building (4th floor)
Hutatma Rajguru Chowk, Madam Cama Road
Mumbai 400 032
The date: September 27, 2018
Read: Maharashtra Act No. 53, dated 10.08.2018.
As per Section 189 (A) of the Maharashtra Municipal Councils, Nagar Panchayats and Industrial Townships Act, there was a provision for levying penalty at the rate of double the property tax per annum for unauthorised construction. It has been observed that some builders illegally construct the buildings and sell the flats and flats to the buyers in the belief that such constructions are duly authorised under the law.
The penalty amount is recovered as if the property was in arrears of tax and hence such buyers are liable to pay the penalty amount for no fault of theirs.
Therefore, instead of imposing double the penalty on the property owner, the Maharashtra Act of 2018 has been amended to fix the penalty amount at a rate to be determined by the government from time to time. The Maharashtra Municipal Councils, Nagar Panchayats and Industrial Townships Act has been amended under section 53.
In pursuance of the amendments made under the said Act, all the Municipal Councils/ Nagar Panchayats in the State are being directed to have a single sentence and to impose penalties with a view to provide justice to the low income groups and to effectively curb unauthorised residential construction as follows:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| 2)   | Residential construction from 601 to 1000 sq. ft. | Property tax is charged at 50% per annum.                                                       |
| 3)   | 1001 sq ft residential building                   | The penalty should be levied at twice the rate of property tax per annum (at the current rate). |
