However, while doing so, the decision was under the consideration of the government as it was necessary to check the educational qualification of the employees, vacancies in the corporation, etc., as per the Municipal Service Admission Rules, and whether the employees were eligible for inclusion.

27 Villages are required to include employees of the respective Gram Panchayats in the municipal service as they then existed.
