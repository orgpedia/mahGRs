According to this policy, in the first phase, the sewage generated at present should be treated on priority by creating a sewage treatment system according to the future needs. The STP capacity required to treat the entire waste water should be sanctioned in the first phase. These include a sewage treatment plant, a sewage treatment plant, a water supply station and a sewage treatment plant. Along with this, arrangements should also be made to collect waste water in some of the different wards of the city. For the rest of the wards, the waste water from the Trunk Main should be collected in a drain and such a drain should be blocked near the Sewerage Treatment Plant (STP) and the waste water should be taken to the Sewerage Treatment Plant at that place. In the second phase, a sewerage system should be constructed and connected to the sewage treatment system created in the first phase. The state government has adopted a policy that this phase will include second-level sewers. Accordingly, in-principle approval is being accorded to the entire sewerage project of Ballarpur city for implementation in a phased manner. As per the above policy, the first phase of the scheme is being given administrative approval through this Government Resolution as mentioned in the Statement below.
