From this fund, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation should select the objectives of the works and expenditure according to their priorities and accordingly the works should be undertaken with the approval of the Standing Committee of the Municipal Corporation. The Nagpur Municipal Corporation will be responsible for utilising the funds for the right cause.
There is no specific head of account available for giving special grants to Nagpur Municipal Corporation.
Therefore, funds will be released to the Nagpur Municipal Corporation from the approved budget of the Urban Development Department by opening a separate account head for this.
