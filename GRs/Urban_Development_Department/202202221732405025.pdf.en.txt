Introduction: The State Government has introduced the Defined Contribution Pension Scheme (DCPS) in place of the old pension scheme for the employees joining government service on or after 1st November, 2005. Since 2015, the DCPS scheme has been transferred to the new National Pension Scheme (NPS) of the Central Government. However, there is no uniformity in the implementation of the scheme at the municipal level. For example, in some municipal corporations, the employee share is not being reduced. Some are run by the municipal corporation. Further, as per the order of the Finance Department dated 19.08.2019, 14% of the appointed contribution is not being paid to all the employees/ officers as well as teaching and non-teaching staff, some Municipal Corporations pay only 5% of the appointed contribution to teachers, there is a deduction under the National Pension Scheme (NPS) but the account of the employees in the National Pension Scheme (NPS) has not been opened yet. Therefore, in the interest of municipal corporation employees/ officers as well as teachers and non-teaching staff, the government was considering taking a decision to have uniformity in this regard in all the municipal corporations as per the guidelines of the Finance Department.
