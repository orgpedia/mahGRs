Out of this, 0.50 per cent is to be paid for preparation of DPR and 0.25 per cent is to be paid till the order of administrative approval before issuing the order of administrative approval for the first phase of projects under Maharashtra Suvarna Jayanti Nagarothana Mahaabhiyan. However, such a detailed project report will not materialize if the concerned consultant does not help in getting administrative approval after preparing the detailed project report of the project. Therefore, while prescribing the stages, a provision has been made to pay 0.75 per cent fee directly after the administrative approval of the projects.
Similarly, for other works, 0.33 per cent is to be paid for preparation of DPR before issuing orders for administrative approval of Phase-I projects and 0.17 per cent till the order of administrative approval. However, such a detailed project report will not materialize if the concerned consultant does not help in getting administrative approval after preparing the detailed project report of the project. Therefore, a provision has been made to pay a fee of 0.50 percent after the administrative approval of the projects is issued directly while prescribing the stages at that time.
However, no fee exceeding 0.50 per cent/ 0.33 per cent shall be admissible/ provided under any circumstances for preparation of project report.
7. In cases where the Urban Local Bodies of the State have agreed to pay additional fee earlier, the fee and the stages of payment should be restructured within the above limits. If the Urban Local Bodies of the State have paid any fee in the past for preparation of DPR to the consultants appointed in pursuance of preparation of DPR earlier, the same shall be adjusted in accordance with the provisions of Para. The permissible allowance should be fixed by adjusting the rate prescribed in section 3 and the same should be paid in a phased manner.
Similarly, the rates of Project Management Fee for the agencies separately empanelled by the State Government under the Maharashtra Suvarna Jayanti Nagarothana Mahaabhiyan will continue to be applicable as prescribed for them.
In cases where the Detailed Project Report is prepared by one organization and another organization has been appointed as Project Management Consultant, the amount admissible to the concerned organizations will be as per the respective stages.
No additional fee other than the fee prescribed in the table in paragraph 3 above for various reasons such as MB recording or any other reason shall be admissible to the Maharashtra Life Authority or any other Project Management Consultant.
