Introduction: The central and state governments have given many instructions to use masks to avoid corona infection in the wake of Corona. Due to the lockdown, people are moving out of their homes for business and work. Citizens, especially in urban areas, are not seen wearing masks or adopting preventive measures in large numbers while stepping out.
