The Proposal:
Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. It was also launched at the level of Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority. District Collector, Mumbai Suburban, Shri. Mauje Kanjurmarg by order dated 1st October, 2020. The land in Kurla was given to the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) in advance for the Metro car shed and ancillary purposes. Meanwhile, Kanjurmarg. Petitions filed in High Court The High Court. By an interim order dated 16.12.2020, the implementation of the aforesaid order of the District Collector, Mumbai Suburbs and the ongoing work on the said land has been stayed.
The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) is of the view that the land at Kanjurmarg is a composite one for the combined car depot of the three metro lines- Line-3, Line-3 and Line-6, as well as for the inter-change station of Line-6 and the proposed Line-14, and given its advantages, the combined car depot can save a relatively large amount of land and its acquisition cost for the car depot of the said separate projects. The land issue at Kanjurmarg is sub judice. The High Court order is likely to remain in force for some more time. In such a situation, the implementation of Metro Line-3 and 6 is likely to be affected and the project cost is likely to increase due to delay in completion of the project. Therefore, considering the current status of the operational planning and construction work of Mumbai Metro Line-3, 4 and 6, the time cost and additional financial cost in the implementation of the project
An alternative suitable site for the Metro car shed needs to be identified keeping in view the load avoidance as well as the efficiency of the project and long-term planning. Against this backdrop, the government has decided to recommend to the state government to identify an alternative site for the metro car shed.
