Government Resolution No: MCO-2023/ PR No.307/ NV-14
The main building, 4th floor,
Hutatma Rajguru Chowk Mumbai- 400032
Date of release: November 24, 2023
Proposal: Decision of the Government. The Directorate of Municipal Administration has been strengthened with effect from 05/08/2022 and the sanctioned posts of the Directorate of Municipal Administration have been increased as per the revised pattern. As the space in the Worli office of the Directorate is becoming insufficient due to increased workload and staff strength, the new office on the seventh floor at Belapur Bhavan in Belapur, Navi Mumbai has been taken on rent with the approval of the Government for meeting arrangements and some of the functions of the Directorate of Municipal Administration have been shifted there.
As the head office of the Directorate of Municipal Administration is located at Worli, Mumbai, all payments are made from the Accounts and Accounts Office, Bandra, Mumbai. Since the extended office is located in Thane district near Mumbai and there are technical difficulties in paying maintenance, electricity, lease and other incidental payments, etc. in that office, the matter of declaring the extended office of the Directorate of Municipal Administration, Belapur, Navi Mumbai as part of the head office was under consideration of the government.
Government Decision: The 7th floor of the Directorate of Municipal Administration, Belapur Building, Sector-11, CBD Belapur, Navi Mumbai is being declared as an extension of the 3rd floor of the Directorate of Municipal Administration, Government Transport Service Building, Sir Pochkhanwala Marg, Worli, Mumbai and the expenditure of this office is being approved to be paid from the Accounts and Accounts Office, Bandra.
In future, if the office of the Directorate of Municipal Administration Belapur, Navi Mumbai is completely shifted to Thane district, the Directorate should take action to get a new drawing and disbursement number for it.
This Government Decision is based on the Informal Reference No. 2 of the Finance Department. Anusam-231/ Copr-5, Dy. being issued with the consent given under 18.09.2023.
