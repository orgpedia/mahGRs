3.2). Bhagirathi Trans Corp. Pvt. Ltd. stated that,
→ From March 23, 2020, due to Covid, the transport service was closed for passengers and the transport service was used to provide essential services. The number of buses used was uncertain. According to the Municipal Corporation, 40 to 50 buses were made available for the workers of the village in a period of two to three hours, as well as the evacuation of people from their homes and other neighborhoods if a COVID patient was found, and the evacuation of the citizens of the coastal areas in the event of a cyclone. Buses and other essential services were available for all. At that time, the municipal corporation never wrote to us to fix the number of buses. Also, the rates were not fixed despite repeated correspondence regarding the rates during the Covid period, nor were the rates fixed during the Covid period as per the government rules.
The corporation demanded from the corporation to determine the average revenue, kilometers driven and expenses for the three months of December, January and February, and the actual expenses of the buses that were not operated out of the expenses incurred during that time, excluding the diesel cost, passenger tax, child support surcharge and the company's profit, but it was refused and the proposal was sent to the Commissioner by the Transport Committee. The commissioner rejected the proposal.
However, in this difficult situation of Covid, it has become very difficult to manage the financial burden while providing essential services. Request you to take appropriate decision in this regard and keep the transport service running smoothly and uninterrupted.
