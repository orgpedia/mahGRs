Accordingly, they should pay the amount of such outstanding electricity dues from their own funds.

2020/ Q. No.56/ NV-4 dated 28.10.2020 as per para (II) (b) (1) already given.
Accordingly, all the urban local bodies should take action regarding the payment of current electricity dues. Further, Tied Grants for improving conservation, supply and management of water including waste water& sewerage can be used to pay part of the ongoing electricity dues of the water supply scheme. For this, the remaining funds can be used for providing ongoing electricity dues to the urban local bodies, taking into account the expenditure to be incurred on other aspects related to the water supply scheme.
Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) belonging to Million Plus Cities group can spend 50% of the Tied Grants for improving conservation, supply and management of water and efficient solid waste management. A part of the current electricity payments of the water supply scheme can be paid from the mandatory subsidy for improving the conservation, supply and management of water. For this, the remaining funds can be used for providing ongoing electricity dues to the urban local bodies, taking into account the expenditure to be incurred on other aspects related to the water supply scheme.
(b) The following measures should be effectively implemented to reduce the consumption of electricity by the Urban Local Bodies and consequently to reduce/ save the burden of electricity bill.
In the case of street lights, the distance between the 2 poles will be very small, which should be increased as per the requirement.
2. Keeping alternate street lights switched off as per requirement should also be considered as per local conditions.
The time of starting of street lights should be fixed according to the local sunrise and sunset and as per the requirement and it should be ensured that the street lights continue to operate during the required time. Care should be taken that street lights are not started when not needed or after the need is over. The responsibility of this should be fixed on the concerned officials.
4. Care should be taken to avoid wastage of electricity in any way and to save energy consumption.
Average payments were made by the MSEDCL initially during the Covid-19 period. Further, it should be checked whether these average payments are based on regular power consumption and accordingly, if the payments are not revised as per regular power consumption in any place, such a matter should be brought to the notice of the MSEDCL authorities and necessary corrections should be made by them.

As a consumer, it should be checked whether the tariff is being charged as per the applicable tariff plan fixed by the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission for each meter of the urban local body (such as street lights, water supply, office, etc.) and if any error is found, such matter should be brought to the notice of the MSEDCL authorities and necessary corrections should be made by them.
The responsibility of implementing all these energy saving measures will be the joint responsibility of the concerned Commissioner, Municipal Corporation/ Principal, Municipal Council/ Nagar Panchayat and all the officers/ employees of the local bodies. It will be the duty and responsibility of all concerned to take care of personal energy savings while taking action in this regard.
