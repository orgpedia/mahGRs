Task Force at City Level (TOR):
The Chairman of the City Level Task Force may invite or accept a member of the Government/ Non-Government organization as a special invitee.
The CTF will conduct training to engineers and their staff working in 24x7 water supply in the city on how to operate 24x7 water supply in at least one ward or district metering area with one DMA or 2,000 households.
The consultants will be responsible for preparing DPR for implementation of 24X7 water supply projects in the city, GIS based survey, design of water supply distribution system, preparation of detailed project report and tender notice in this regard, assisting the city administration in converting the existing water supply system of the city into 24X7 water supply scheme, after the work of 24X7 project starts, the PMC will carry out the work.
The consultants will be responsible for supervising the work of the 24x7 water supply scheme in the city till its completion.
V. Mapping of water supply infrastructure for operational zones in the city. Design of transmission mains from water works or overhead water reservoirs and water distribution channels in operational zones/ cities
i. To ensure that maps of water supply infrastructure of operational zones are available with them.
(ii) Prepare and maintain a proper digital map of water supply network in the operational zones/ cities.

Government Resolution No: AMRIT-2022/ PR No.383/ NV-33
iii. Preparation of As built drawings for operational zones of water supply in cities.
iv They need to adopt the existing network data conversion GIS policy. Correctly preparing maps using Geographical Control Points (GCP) collected in the city to be made in GIS format.
v. Digitization of ward boundaries and converting them into GIS format with ward-wise area and population characteristics of the last 5 decades census.
vi. City Land Use Maps for operational zones/ cities to be prepared with the help of City Development Plan (CDP).
vii City Engineers should be directed to geo-reference these maps through their GIS cell and convert them into GIS format, as most of the cities have their water supply scheme distribution system and transmission network map available in Auto CAD format.
Assess the current status of existing pipelines and valves in the city of Vili and indicate the pipeline to be used on GIS mapping and use the same while designing.
vi. Ensure that the city has perennial sustainable water sources with 95%.
Population projections for the intermediate and final stages of 15 years and 30 years respectively before the base year; the base year is the expected year of execution of the proposed project. The population should be estimated ward-wise considering the ward-wise population density for the operational zone/ city and the equivalent area method.
The distribution system should be designed with a peak factor of 2.5. The projected demand of the respective operational zones/ cities should be taken into account while designing all the pipeline sources and distribution systems in the city.
Since the transmission main is the main line of the project, it should be designed with capital and energy optimization.
X. To ensure that the proposed new pipelines and new planned service reservoirs are built by demonstrating the existing GIS-based hydraulic models.
For the distribution system, the following must be ensured: One operational zone shall be kept for each service reservoir/ pumping station.
" All proposed District Metered Areas (DMAs) should be hydraulically isolated.
iii. The boundary of the operational zone should be fixed in such a way as to ensure that the reservoirs do not empty or overflow.
iv Distribution pipe network is existing as well as newly proposed pipes are required for 100% coverage in the proposed DMA.

v. After running the model, the nodal pressures are checked for the requirement of heads (say 17m for cities with a population of more than 1 lakh and 12m for cities with a population of less than 1 lakh) and the flow speed in the pipes should not be more than 3m/ s.
Home service connections are provided for pipes with a diameter of more than 100 mm. For this purpose, additional rider pipes should be indicated and included in the design of the distribution system.
vii Critical points for the design of a SCADA system such as the highest elevation nodes and the farthest location should be shown in the GIS based distribution maps.
viii Where the width of the road is 6 m and above, pipelines should be laid on both sides.
xii. Regarding metering, the following should be ensured.
I. 100% customer metering.
Each meter is GIS tagged.
iii Tariff based on volumetric usage is with telescopic rate.
iv Bulk meters are installed at all strategic and suitable locations so that NRW calculation is possible, and its reduction is possible.
v. All bulk meters are connected to the SCADA system.
vi For commercial, industrial and high-rise societies, automatic meter reading (AMR) meters should be planned.
vil required Control Valve (FCV/ PRVS for hilly areas) to be planned for the designed distribution of water.
viii WTP, MBRs, ZBRs (Zonal Balance Reservoirs), ESRS, Pumping Stations are all on the roads in use and the roads for the missing lanes should be proposed in the DPR along with the cost so that the pipelines up to the city limits are all laid on the roads in use.
ix Head works, all pumping stations and power on WTP is on 24x7 mode For this purpose, express feeders of stations of 11 kV or more should be proposed in the DPR along with its cost.
x. Water hammer controlling equipment for all pumping mains should be installed in the proper place.
For growth it is necessary to analyze the pumping mains. The maximum negative pressure should not be less than 0.9 kg/ cm2. In cities where water is pumped directly into their distribution system, the same procedure is followed.
xi Wherever possible, the Brake Pressure Tank (BPT) should be planned. The inlet and outlet of the BPT should be kept at the same level.

xiii. Ensure that the reservoirs supplying water to the high level areas should be separated and fed by separate transmission mains so that only the required amount of water is pumped to the high level and optimize the energy consumption.
xiv. To ensure that the House Service Connection (HSC) replacement appendage should be included in the DPR as there is leakage at the joint/ junction of municipal pipe with HSC if there is no ferrule connection and the connection is made by an unskilled plumber.
Establishment of Customer Grievance Redressal Cell.
Emergency (in case of source failure) management system should be set up for each city.
xvii. Ensure- Every city has set up a Non-Revenue Water (NRW) cell.
The duration of the City-Level Task Force (CTF) will be initially for 3 years (2022-2024) and will be extended till the completion of AMRUT 2.0 period.
Under Reference No. 3, it will be mandatory for the State Level and City Level Task Force (Task Force) constituted for the 24x7 water supply project under the Centrally Sponsored AMRUT 2.0 Mission to work as per the guidelines issued by the Central Government.
