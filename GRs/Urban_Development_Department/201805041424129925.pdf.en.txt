Government Resolution No.Kadompa-1006/ P.No. 192/2006, No.26, dated 2nd March, 2009.
Government Circular: The problem of unauthorized construction in the urban areas of the state seems to be getting serious day by day. The transactions where construction is carried out without obtaining proper permissions from the developer and thereafter sale of such flats/ properties is registered with the concerned Sub-Registrar. However, when the said construction is found to be unauthorised, the innocent tenant or flat holder has to face eviction proceedings if the eviction is carried out by the Urban Local Bodies/ Planning Authority. In fact, most of the tenant farmers and flat owners do not know that the building they live in is unauthorised. This is cheating the landlords and tenants. In order to avoid these issues, instructions have been issued under the relevant Government Decision dated March 2, 2009.
