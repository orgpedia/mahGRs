The Proposal:
The state is urbanising at a rapid pace, with around 47 to 48% of the population living in urban Maharashtra. At present, there are 369 urban local bodies, including 240 municipal councils and 129 nagar panchayats, in the state. These institutions are governed by the Directorate of Municipal Administration. The need for a competent Directorate of Municipal Administration is necessary for the speedy resolution of the problems arising from the increasing urbanization in the state as well as the qualitative implementation of infrastructure projects in urban areas, and for this, the government was considering to revise the headquarters, divisional and district level structure of the Directorate. The Directorate of Municipal Administration has a sanctioned strength of 274 posts. Considering the nature of work and scope of responsibility of the Directorate, the sanctioned posts in the structure are very few, therefore, the proposal to revise the structure of the Directorate was approved by the High Level Committee of Secretaries and Shri. The following decisions are taken with the approval of the Cabinet:
GOVERNMENT DECISION: It is approved to revise the head office, divisional level and district level structure of the Directorate of Municipal Administration as follows: (1) The revised structure is being approved by abolishing 138 posts from the existing structure of 274 posts of the Directorate of Municipal Administration and 503 permanent posts and 47 posts to be taken by external agencies as follows:
