Circular:
The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is being implemented across the country since 2nd October, 2014 with an aim to make the entire country clean by October, 2019. On the same lines, the implementation of Swachh Maharashtra Abhiyan (Urban) is being taken up in a Mission Mode throughout the State as per the Government Decision dated 15th May, 2015
method is in progress. Under this mission, two major aspects are to make the cities" Open Defecation Free" and" Clean" under solid waste management.
It has been almost 3 years since the implementation of Swachh Maharashtra Abhiyan (Urban). Therefore, it is necessary to accelerate efforts to make urban areas of the state clean and hygienic. Accordingly, the urban areas of the State have been declared Open Defecation Free on 1st October, 2017.
Now, every city needs to maintain the status of" Open Defecation Free City." Considering this fact, a comprehensive review of the implementation of the Mission was undertaken in April, 2018 by organizing workshops at the divisional level in the State.
3. It has been observed in the workshops that in some of the urban local bodies areas of the State, construction of individual household toilets is still incomplete. Also, in some cities, the first instalment of funds for construction of individual toilets has been disbursed to the beneficiaries. However, they have not started construction of individual household toilets. Such Urban Local Bodies shall complete the construction of all individual household toilets by 30th May, 2018 and upload the geo-tagging photographs thereof on the web portal of the Central Government. Also, the work of Aadhaar updation of beneficiaries who have completed the construction of individual household toilets will be taken up immediately on May 30.

Government Circular No: SWA-2018/ PR No.208/ NV-34 should be completed by 2018. It will be mandatory for all urban local bodies to follow these timelines.
4. In order to sustain the status of" Open Defecation Free City" of the cities in the State, it is imperative to maintain public and community toilets well. Toilets must have electricity and water supply, as well as doors and toilets. Accordingly, care should be taken to maintain and repair public and community toilets.
Under the Swachh Maharashtra Abhiyan (Urban), the cities of the state should strictly follow the instructions given by the Government Circular No. 2 in the context of maintaining the status of Open Defecation Free. Also, the ODF+ and ODF++ standards should be implemented.
It has been observed that OD Watch is not being maintained after the urban areas of the State were declared Open Defecation Free on 1st October, 2017 under Swachh Maharashtra Abhiyan (Urban). It is the responsibility of every urban local body to maintain the status of" Open Defecation Free City" of the cities of the state permanently. Therefore, all Urban Local Bodies are advised to re-implement the OD Watch programme on a daily basis for the next 3 months.
The Government in the context No. 2 has said that after the urban local bodies in the state are declared open defecation free, the cities must make efforts to achieve ODF+ and ODF++ status.
Instructions have been issued. Accordingly, the septic tanks of individual household toilets, community toilets and public toilets in the city must be cleaned after a certain period of time by vacuum emitter, removing the accumulated dirt and disposing of that dirt after processing it scientifically.
8. In order to maintain the status of cities declared open defecation free in the State, it is imperative to take action as above. For this, considering the number of septic tanks of individual household toilets, community toilets and public toilets in the city, their size, the families using them, etc., the sewage from all these septic tanks in the city should be removed through a vacuum emitter system and processed in the STP (Sewage Treatment Plant) available near the city. The cities where STP is not available will be required to carry out scientific procedures on such miles. Technical guidance, if required, will be provided by the Directorate of Swachh Maharashtra Mission (Urban) and CEPT.
Incentive grant received in respect of Open Defecation Free cities under Swachh Maharashtra Abhiyan (Urban) only for works permitted by the Government vide Government Order dated 28th March, 2016.
