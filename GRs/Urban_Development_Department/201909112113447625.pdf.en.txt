The Proposal:
In line with the Central Government's" Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Urban)," the implementation of" Swachh Maharashtra Abhiyan (Urban)" has started in the State as per the Government decision dated 15th May, 2015. Under the Mission, the two major components are to make the cities" open defecation free" by providing individual household toilets or community toilets to the households in the cities who do not have access to toilets, to transport 100% segregated waste generated in the city under Solid Waste Management by segregating it at source (wet and dry), to treat wet waste centrally or in a decentralized manner and to make the city" clean."
2. In order to speed up the implementation of Swachh Maharashtra Mission and to give due respect to the cities which have become open defecation free and clean, it has been decided to give incentive grant as per the category of cities. This was done in pursuance of the Government Decision dated 28.03.2016.

Government Resolution No: SWABHAA-2016/ No.23/ NO.34
The certification of Open Defecation Free cities is done by the Central Government and accordingly, the first two phases of the above-mentioned incentive grants to the cities that have qualified the Central Government's examination have been disbursed to the respective cities. With a view to sustaining the sanitation standards of the cities and to manage the city's toilets, the Government has implemented the concept of ODF+ and ODF++. Every open defecation-free city in the state must become ODF+ and ODF++. Therefore, it was under the consideration of the Government to link the stages of distribution of incentive subsidy under the above paragraph 2 given by the State Government for Open Defecation Free (ODF+) to the stages of ODF+ and ODF++ of the city.
