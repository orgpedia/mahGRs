Government's decision
Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Urban) is being implemented in the state on the lines of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan of the Central Government. Under this campaign, all the cities of the state are participating in the Swachh Survekshan conducted by the Central Government every year and efforts are being made to make the cities clean, beautiful and green.
The Diamond Jubilee of the formation of the State of Maharashtra is being celebrated on May 1, 2020, and to realize the vision of a clean, beautiful and green Maharashtra, the Government is approving the implementation of the Diamond Jubilee Maharashtra- Urban Sanitation Campaign in all the Urban Local Bodies of the State from March 1, 2020 to April 30, 2020.
3. In order to effectively implement the special campaign" Diamond Jubilee Maharashtra- Urban Sanitation Campaign" in every city of the state, the following suggestions are being given:
(1) Management of Solid Waste in the City: As per the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, every Urban Local Body shall manage the solid waste in its city, including (i) 100% door-to-door collection of waste generated in the city, (ii) 100% segregation of solid waste (wet, dry and household hazardous waste) at the point of generation,
(iii) Scientific processing (composting or biomethanation) of segregated wet waste
Secondary segregation of dry waste at Material Recovery Centre (MRF) and sending it to Recycle Mechanism.
Organizing scientific disposal of household hazardous wastes.

(iv) Biomining of old accumulated waste.
(v) Construction and demolition waste (C& D waste).
(a) 100% Collection of Solid Waste generated in the City: Every Urban Local Body is required to ensure 100% door-to-door collection of solid waste generated in the city. However, some of the Urban Local Bodies which still have less than 100% coverage should plan necessary measures to increase this coverage to 100% during this Diamond Jubilee period of Maharashtra- Urban Sanitation Mission and achieve 100% door-to-door collection of solid waste in our city by 30th April, 2020.
(b) Increasing Segregation of Solid Waste: As per the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, it is mandatory for the waste generator to segregate the solid waste at the point of generation. But, today the average percentage of solid waste segregation in the state of mitis is very low. This ratio needs to be increased. Therefore, the urban local bodies in the cities where the percentage of solid waste segregation at the place of generation is less than 100 percent, should increase the rate of segregation in the city to 100 percent by taking necessary measures during this Diamond Jubilee Maharashtra- Urban Sanitation Campaign period.
(a) 100% processing of segregated solid waste:
scientific processing (composting or biomethanation) of wet waste,
Secondary segregation of dry waste into Material Recovery Centre (MRF) and send it to Recycle Units.
100 percent processing of the solid waste segregated in this way. However, at present the processing of segregated waste is low. During this Diamond Jubilee period of Maharashtra- Urban Sanitation Mission, the process of segregation of solid waste should be increased to 100% by taking necessary measures.
(d) Biomining of legacy waste: Unprocessed legacy waste piles up at dumping grounds in cities. It is necessary to free up the dumping ground space by conducting biomining process on this old waste. To do this, in the detailed project report of each city, a provision has been made to do biomining on old accumulated waste. According to this provision every city should start action during this cleanliness campaign period, the cities which have started action earlier should work more vigorously and stop the dumping grounds in the cities.

Efforts to reduce garbage heaps should be made during this diamond jubilee period of Maharashtra- Urban Sanitation Campaign.

As per the Construction and Demolition Waste Rules, 2016 (C& D Waste Rules, 2016), it is the responsibility of the concerned waste generators to dispose of these materials. But, most of the time, these materials are dumped on the city roads by the concerned.
Urban Local Bodies should plan necessary measures to ensure that construction and demolition waste from cities is not dumped on city roads e.g. construction
And the space for storage of demolition waste should be available with the urban local body, special vehicle should be available for transportation of such material, the contact number for collection and transportation of such material should be published and the waste should be brought to the place reserved for this purpose in the city, such kind of material should be quarantined.
(in concrete, clay, iron, wood, plastic, etc.) and then use this material in the places in the city where it is necessary to fill. Cities where construction and demolition material processing projects have been implemented
They should reuse or recycle the material during this diamond jubilee period of Maharashtra- Urban Sanitation Campaign.
Construction and demolition waste generators who after arranging the above and
Punitive action should be taken against those who dump waste on roads or other places.
(ii) Improvement and beautification of roads: Measures should be taken during the period of Diamond Jubilee Maharashtra- Urban Sanitation Campaign to make the roads of the city look clean and beautiful e.g.
(i) Cleaning of roads by lifting garbage, soil etc. dumped beside the road.
(ii) Unused vehicles parked on the road should be removed and the road should be opened for smooth traffic. For this, the campaign should be implemented with the help of the concerned department during the campaign period.
