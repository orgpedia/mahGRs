Reference:- 1) S.N.Urban Development Department, No. MUN-2018/ PR. No.197/ Nov.18 dated 17/11/2018 2) Sh. Urban Development Department, No. 2019/ p. No.15/ NO-26 dated 06/03/2019 Preamble: With a view to implement the policy of Housing for All-2022, the Government has decided to allocate pattas to the encroachers of encroached lands belonging to Urban Local Bodies as well as encroachments of lands under the Revenue Department in the area of Urban Local Bodies in accordance with the rules. Guidelines for allotment of pattas have been finalised vide order dated 17.11.2018 and action has been initiated accordingly. After that. As per the Government decision dated 06.03.2019, these guidelines have been made applicable for allotment of pattas to encroached slum dwellers on land belonging to other Government departments (excluding forest land) falling in the area of Urban Local Bodies.
However, the proceedings are currently pending as there is no provision for giving lease deeds to encroachers who have been encroaching upon private land in the urban areas for years and such land is not in their own names. As a result, it has come to the notice of the government that the encroachers of such lands are not able to take the benefit of the central government's ambitious scheme of" Housing for All-2022."
Accordingly, in respect of grant of lease by Urban Local Bodies to slum dwellers occupying encroached private land in the area of Urban Local Bodies in the State, if the encroached area of the encroachers in the area of Urban Local Bodies in the State is termed as a declared slum, it has been decided to work out the modalities for allotment of lease to encroached slum dwellers on private land in the area of other Urban Local Bodies excluding the private land in the area of Urban Local Bodies under the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority. The decision was taken by the Cabinet at its meeting dated 20/08/2019.
Accordingly, the government was contemplating issuing a government resolution in this regard.
