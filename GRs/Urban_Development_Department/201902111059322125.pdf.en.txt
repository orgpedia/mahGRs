Reference:- 1. Resolution passed on 09.01.2018 No. 71 2) Letter from the Commissioner, Solapur Municipal Corporation No. A/ W/ 346, dated 12.02.2018
Preamble: Solapur Municipal Corporation In the General Meeting held on 09.01.2018, Resolution No. 71 has been passed in which it has been decided to make 9 wards instead of 8 for Solapur Municipal Corporation. However, under the Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act, 1949, Rule No. The Commissioner recommended to the government to dissolve the resolution as it was not in the financial interest of the Municipal Corporation as per the provision of section 451.
As the divisional office has to be structured according to the ward for the convenience of administrative work, Section 29 (a) (1) of the Municipal Corporation Act, 1949 provides for a maximum of 9 wards for a population of 4.50 lakh to 12.00 lakh. Also, there is a provision of 1 ward for every 1.5 lakh population for additional population.
Solapur city has a population of 9.51 lakh as of 2011 and accordingly 7 wards are completed taking into account the provisions of the Act. For the remaining 0.51 lakh population and considering the increase in population in the last 7 years and in view of the geographical contiguity and administrative control over the day-to-day affairs in the area of Solapur Municipal Corporation, 8 wards are expected to be identified. However, since the corporation has decided to make 9 wards, it will have to provide 1 divisional office, office building, ward officers, other necessary staff for this. This is not financially viable. Therefore, as the resolution as per section 29 (a) (1) of the Act is against the public interest, the Municipal Corporation General Assembly has been constituted as per section 451 (2) of the Act. Resolution passed on 09.01.2018 No. The Commissioner, Solapur Municipal Corporation has recommended the dismantling of 71.
