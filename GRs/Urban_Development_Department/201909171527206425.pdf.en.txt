Government Resolution No: SWA-2019/ P.No.212 (1)/ NV-34
Hutatma Rajguru Chowk, Madam Cama Marg,
Mantralaya, Mumbai- 400 032
The date: September 17, 2019
The Proposal:
Successful implementation of Swachh Maharashtra Abhiyan (Urban) under Swachh Bharat Mission
The urban areas of the state were declared open defecation free on October 1, 2017. Also, action is being taken to" clean" the cities by managing the solid waste in the cities.
Under the Swachh Bharat Mission, segregation and scientific processing of waste is the core of solid waste management.
2. Under Swachh Maharashtra Abhiyan (Urban), the State Government has registered the brand" Harit Maha City Compost" under Government Decision dated 29th April, 2017 for marketing and selling of organic manure produced by scientific processing of degradable (wet) waste from segregated solid waste in the cities while managing solid waste in the cities of the State.
Till now, in most of the cities, solid waste was being dumped at dumping sites without any processing. Solid waste collection was causing various problems in different cities in the state. To overcome this problem, the solid waste generated in the cities should be segregated at the place of generation
It is necessary to promote/ encourage scientific processing of degradable (wet) wastes from segregated and segregated solid wastes. This should encourage urban local bodies to prepare compost manure from segregated degradable solid waste in the city and to use this organic manure by farmers on a large scale.
The government was considering giving incentives to local bodies.
Government's decision:
Considering the points mentioned in the Preamble, the Government approves grant of incentive of Rs.1,500/-per MT to the Urban Local Bodies which will generate compost from the segregated wet waste of the city as per the following procedure.
