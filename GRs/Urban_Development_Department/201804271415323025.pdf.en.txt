(2) Government Resolution No. 18/01/2017 3) Letter No. Auction Division/ 4449 dated 06/08/2016
Preamble: The Nagpur Improvement Trust allots land under the provisions of the Nagpur Improvement Trust Land Appropriation Rules, 1983, by way of tender or on occasion by way of public offer by way of advertisement in newspapers for plots, sheds and shops. The" maximum bid amount" is taken on the spot as per the terms and conditions of the tender/ auction. After this, the second 25% amount has to be paid within 1 month by providing the approval of the Nagpur Improvement Trust Board. For this amount, a maximum of 5 months extension is given by charging 15% interest and a period of 1 month is given to pay the remaining 50%. The maximum extension for this amount is 18 months with an interest rate of 15%. A period of 24 months will be given from the date of the proposal.
But after some parties had convinced 25% of the amount of the stipend, some 50% and some 80% of the amount, the remaining amount could not be deposited within the period of the offer letter i.e. 24 months, on this reason, their proposal for allotment of the plot was withdrawn by the Nagpur Improvement Trust. In such a case, the Nagpur Correctional Service has issued a notice to the above mentioned No. A proposal had been submitted to the Government.
Accordingly, in the Nagpur Reforms and Land Appropriation Rules, 1983, Rule No. As per Section 16 of the Act, 50% of the free plot is to be paid within 30 days from the date of allotment. The remaining amount must be paid within 30 days. The Chairman can extend the time period for payment of gratuity up to 6 months by charging 15% interest. There is no provision in the rules as to what percentage of interest should be charged if the delay is more than 6 months. The 17 plots have been allotted between 1981 and 2011.
At present, there is no provision in the law to take any decision in this regard. However, Rule No. 26 The Government may, as a special case, relax the aforesaid rules by stating the reasons for the case and such plot holders may, as a special case, get relief and in the alternative, avoid financial loss to the concerned plot holder as well as to the Nagpur Improvement Trust.

04. Refer No. 01 Look at the price of the plots proposed here, at the time of allotment of the plots and it cannot be ruled out that the present price of these plots has increased substantially. If the remaining amount is allowed to be paid at the time of allotment at the cost of the plot itself, it will cause financial loss to the Nagpur Improvement Trust. Such a possibility cannot be ruled out in the future. In fact, at the time when the said plot was allotted to the concerned applicant, it was required to be informed by the Nagpur Improvement Trust that the allotment of the said plot was cancelled by refunding the amount of the first instalment to the applicant immediately as per the provisions of the rules on the ground that the concerned applicants had not paid the second instalment within the stipulated time after paying the first instalment. However, that doesn't seem to be happening here.
05. Accordingly, vide No. 01 Out of the cases proposed herein, in the 16 cases in the Annexure attached hereto, the Government is empowered under Rule 26 of the Nagpur Improvement and Land Appropriation Rules, 1983, to accept the payment of plot as a special case, subject to the approval of the Authority vide No. The decision has been approved by the government.
6.Now on the same lines as reference No. 03 As per the letter, a proposal was received from the Nagpur Improvement Trust and accordingly, a proposal to approve the proposal was under consideration. Accordingly, the government has taken the following decisions:
The Government Resolution No. In the proposal, shop No. 14, Area 262.96, in respect of the plot allotted to Crystal Point Partner Gopichand Dhanrajani, the Government is pleased to accept the payment of the plot as a" special case" under Rule No. 16 of the Nagpur Improvement Project Land Appropriation Rules, 1983, No. 26, with relaxation of the following terms and conditions.
Terms and Conditions: 1) In this case, the Nagpur Correctional Authority shall re-affirm that there has been a delay in depositing the amount due to reasons beyond the control of the applicant.
(a) The amount shall be charged at the rate of 15% on the principal amount of the plot allotted from the date of payment of last instalment till 31st March, 2018.
