To make available the self-financing amount of Municipal Councils/ Nagar Panchayats in urban tribal areas under Maharashtra Suvarna Jayanti Nagarothana Mahaabhiyan from tribal applications.
The Government of Maharashtra
the Urban Development Department
Government Resolution No. Parikshit-2015/ P.S.No.273/ NV-33
Ministry, Mumbai- 400 032.
Date: December 11, 2020
Reference: 1) Government Resolution Urban Development Department No. 273/ NV-33 dated 09th March, 2016.
The Proposal:
As per the scheme's financial framework, the share of urban local bodies should be 30 per cent for Class D municipal corporations, 25 per cent for Class A municipal councils, 15 per cent for Class B municipal councils and 10 per cent for Class C municipal councils/ nagar panchayats. However, as the Municipal Councils/ Nagar Panchayats in the tribal sub-plan areas are not financially sound, as they are not able to pay for the projects sanctioned under the Maharashtra Suvarna Jayanti Mahaabhiyan in the area, the self-assurance amount of these Municipal Councils/ Nagar Panchayats is made available through Tribal Appropriation (TSP). The list of Municipal Councils/ Nagar Panchayats in the tribal sub-plan area is at Annexure-A to the said Government Resolution. As suggested by the Tribal Development Department in the" Annexure-A" of the said Government decision, the inclusion of some more Municipal Councils/ Nagar Panchayats in the main tribal sub-plan areas of the State was under consideration of the Government.
Government's decision:
As the Municipal Councils/ Nagar Panchayats in the tribal sub-plan area are not financially sound and are unable to pay their share of funds for the projects sanctioned under the Maharashtra Suvarna Jayanti Nagarothana Mahaabhiyan as per the financial figures in the scheme, the list of Nagar Panchayats/ Municipal Councils in Annexure' A" of the relevant Government decision is being updated as follows.
