The Proposal:
In line with the Central Government's Swachh Bharat Mission, the Government of India has decided to implement the
Swachh Maharashtra Abhiyan is being implemented in the state. Under the Mission, the two major components are to make the cities" Open Defecation Free" by providing individual or community toilets to households in the cities who do not have access to toilets, and to make the cities" Clean" by managing the city's solid waste as per the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016.
Accordingly, under this campaign, the entire urban area of the state has been declared open defecation free on October 1, 2017, by providing toilet facilities to the families in the state who do not have access to toilet facilities.
3. After making all the cities of the State Open Defecation Free (ODF), these cities are being made ODF+ in order to ensure continuity of open defecation free (ODF) status and better toilet facilities to the citizens of the cities. Henceforth, the citizens of the state are required to achieve" ODF++" status by ensuring safe and regular management of sewage in the septic tanks of the toilets in the cities along with better toilet facilities.
4. Under Swachh Maharashtra Abhiyan, while making cities open defecation free, the toilets in the areas where sewerage system exists in the cities should be cleaned with a view to managing the filth.
system is connected. So, toilets in areas/ cities where sewage system is not present have been connected to the safety tank. Toilet facilities:

The process is being carried out at the Sewerage Treatment Plants (STPs) in the respective cities. However, in the areas/ towns where toilets have been connected to the safety tanks due to non-availability of sewerage system
Toilet faucets need to be cleaned and cleaned regularly.
At present, Sewerage and Sewerage Treatment Plants (STPs) are fully or partially operational in 36 cities of the state. The safe and regular management of sewage in the septic tanks of the toilets in those cities is being done in the Sewerage Processing Center of the same city. So, in order to ensure safe and regular management of sewage sludge from the septic tanks of the toilets in 32 cities where Sewage Treatment Plants (STP) do not exist, but those cities are within 20 km radius of the cities where Sewage Treatment Plants (STP) exist, instructions have been issued under the Government Decision No. 4 dated 15.12.2018 to co-process the sewage sludge with the nearest cities where Sewage Treatment Plants (STP) are located. So, 5 cities have separate septic tank Filtration Processing Centre (FSTP). Thus, out of 384 cities in the state, the sewage from the septic tanks of the toilets in 73 cities is being managed safely and regularly. The remaining 311 cities need to implement the technology by selecting the right technology as the sewage in septic tanks needs to be managed safely and regularly.
Under the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed with the Centre for Environmental Planning and Technology (CEPT), Ahmedabad under the Swachh Maharashtra Mission, the Institute has suggested the following 4 technical options for processing the sludge in the septic tank.
1) Sludge Drying Bed (SDB) 2) Planted Sludge Drying Bed (P.D.B.) the SDB),
3) Moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) 4) Upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (U. the ASB).
In line with the above consideration, the government was considering to approve the implementation of the septic tank in 311 cities of the state by selecting suitable technology for safe and regular management of sewage and its processing.
Government Decision: Considering the points mentioned in the Preamble, the Centre for Environmental Planning and Technology (CEPT), Ahmedabad has recommended and

One of the technologies approved by the institute is Sludge Drying Bed (SDB).
The technology is easy to implement, the materials needed for the construction and erection of the project are local
Contractors can have easy access, electricity supply is minimal to keep the project running and
Fragmented power supply does not affect this and also, the project is easy to maintain. As such
Sewage from septic tanks in cities where Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) do not exist
Sludge Drying Beds (SDBs) for safe and regular management and processing.
Government to set up Faster Sequestration Processing Centre (FSTP) in septic tanks based on technology selected
approves.
2. Taking into account the population of urban local bodies in the State, the septic
The dirt in the tank is sufficiently capable of being removed by a vacuum emitter and processed; in front of it
Sludge of the shown section wise price (as per the section wise tariff list of Maharashtra Life Authority)
The Government is granting administrative approval for setting up of drying beds (SDBs) subject to the terms and conditions mentioned in paragraph 3 below.
