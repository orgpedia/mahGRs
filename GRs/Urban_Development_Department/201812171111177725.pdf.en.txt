Mantralaya, Mumbai- 400 032
Date: 17th of December 2018
Introduction: As an innovation in planning of water supply projects included in the framework of AMRUT Mission, the State Government has included solar power projects in these projects based on the availability of space for pumping energy.
Similarly, some of the projects being implemented under the Maharashtra Suvarnajayanti Nagarotthan Mahabhiyan include solar power infrastructure. This solar energy component will save energy required for water supply/ sewerage projects and will help in making the scheme sustainable and self-sustaining. This will also save energy. The matter of deciding by whom to implement the solar power sub-station was under the consideration of the government.
Government's decision:
The Government has decided to implement solar energy installations in water supply and sewerage projects under AMRUT Mission and Maharashtra Suvarnajayanti Nagarotna Abhiyan in a qualitative manner and to achieve the desired results, the work of these solar energy installations will be implemented on a full-fledged basis through Maharashtra Power Development Authority (MPDA), which is the competent technical body of the Government in this regard.
This decision will be applicable to all the projects that have been approved earlier and will be approved later under the AMRUT Mission and Maharashtra Suvarnajayanti Nagarotna Maha Abhiyan.
The works of the solar power sub-station included in the energy saving in the water supply/ sewerage projects approved under the Centrally Sponsored AMRUT Mission should be implemented on full deposit basis through the Maharashtra Energy Development Authority (MEDA) as follows.
