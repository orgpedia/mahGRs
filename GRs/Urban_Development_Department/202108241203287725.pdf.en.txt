Read:- Akola Municipal Corporation Letter No. Amanpa/ Sapravi/ Astha/ 347/2021 dated 17/06/2021
Preamble: The Commissioner, Akola Municipal Corporation has given the above. A request has been made to the Government regarding the dissolution of the subject resolution vide letter dated 17/06/2021. According to the letter, considering the shortage of technical staff for various departments of Akola Municipal Corporation, tenders were floated as per the administrative proposal of the corporation regarding the supply of staff for various departments. The Standing Committee has passed a subject-wise resolution regarding the extension of the old contract door until the completion of the new tender process without approving the administrative proposal for the approval of the tender.
In this case, since the tender process has been carried out as per the rules, and as per the prescribed procedure, the L-1 organization is required to be given work as per the tender, the subject resolution of the standing committee is not justified. In view of this fact, the Standing Committee of Akola Municipal Corporation passed Resolution No. 02 D. 01/04/2021, the matter of taking action under the provision of Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act 451 was under consideration of the Government.
The government has taken the following decisions:
