The Government of India has launched the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Urban) with the objective of making all the cities of the country completely clean, healthy and liveable and to ensure clean and good health and environment to all the citizens. On the lines of this campaign, the' Swachh Maharashtra Abhiyan (Urban)" is being implemented in the state under the decision of the government.
Under the Swachh Bharat Mission, the detailed project report of solid waste management of urban local bodies in the state has been prepared and its implementation is underway at the level of urban local bodies. The government has also issued instructions from time to time regarding the collection, classification, transportation, and scientific processing of waste generated in the city. All the directives given by the government regarding solid waste management and the detailed project report approved must be followed exactly.
The water from the old water reservoirs, ponds and wells in the city is used for drinking. Therefore, the concerned urban local bodies should ensure that the waste generated in the city is not dumped in the old water bodies, ponds and wells of the city, but it is taken to the processing site and processed in a scientific manner. Measures should be taken to protect and conserve the waste generated in the city so that it does not fall into the old water bodies, lakes and wells of the city and rainwater harvesting should be used wherever necessary.
