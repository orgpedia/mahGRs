The Government's Decisions:
As per the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation Services (Admission to Services and Classification of Services) Rules, 2021, no "Executive Engineer" (Construction) is eligible for promotion to the post of "Additional City Engineer" (Construction).

However, as he does not hold a degree in architectural engineering from a recognised university, the Navi Mumbai Municipal Services (Admission to Services and Classification of Services) Rules, 2021
They do not possess the qualifications required. As a result, there has been a lack of promotion in the Executive Engineer (Architecture) cadre.
