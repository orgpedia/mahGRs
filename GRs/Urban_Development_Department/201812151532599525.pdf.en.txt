Government Resolution No.-1214/ No. 101/ No.28
Madam Cama Marg, Hutatma Rajguru Chowk,
4th Floor, Mantralaya, Mumbai- 400 032.
Date: 14th of December 2018
Reference:- Commissioner, Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation, vide letter No.Namumpa/ Para-1/ T.No.Astha-5/ 667/2018, Dy. 21/06/2018.
The Proposal:
CIDCO has constructed flats of different areas for the people of different income groups while developing the city of Navi Mumbai. Among them, the flats and chawls developed for the low-income group have been divided into small condominiums by CIDCO.
These flats have been given to the flat owners on a lease of 60 years by CIDCO. The association of flat owners in this condominium is registered under the Maharashtra Ownership Act 1970. Such associations and the flat owners under their jurisdiction are empowered to levy charges for maintenance and repair and thereby maintain/ repair the buildings. However, the lease agreement of the colonies under this condominium is for a period of 60 years and since the original owner is believed to be SIDCO, these old buildings will be provided with internal infrastructure, such as the construction of a new building. It is necessary to provide related services like sewerage/ water supply etc.
As per Section 165, 167 and 192 of the Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act, the Commissioner has the power to compel the owner/ occupier to provide drainage. However, this does not include condominium work. The Urban Development Department No. AMC 14200/2264/ Q.No.144/ NV-24, Dy. As per 26/01/2001, the works of private institutions/ co-operative societies/ individual beneficiaries cannot be done from the ward or councillor funds. However, the construction of the flats in the said condominium is about 25 to 30 years ago. As a result, the water supply and sewerage lines in the premises of this building have almost expired and the complaints of inadequate water supply and frequent choking of sewerage lines are coming to the city corporation.

Government Resolution No: No.1214/ P.No. 101/ NV-28
The councillors have demanded in the general assembly and standing committee meeting that the low-income group flat owners in the condominiums should be able to bear the huge expenses for the replacement of water and sewer lines. Therefore, the Municipal Corporation started the work of changing the water lines and sewer lines in the condominiums in the year 2000-2001. However, the works carried out under the condominium were stopped as the works did not fit into the prescribed guidelines of the works to be taken up from the municipal fund. But since these works were very necessary from the point of view of health, the matter of approving these works from the municipal fund was under the consideration of the government.
Government's decision:
300 built by CIDCO in Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation area. The government is approving the sewerage works of the flats under the condominium which does not have a boundary.
If the Commissioner, Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation, feels it necessary, the government is also approving the water supply works under the said condominium from the municipal fund.
