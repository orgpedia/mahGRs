Introduction: To bring the youth of the minority community into the mainstream of progress, it is necessary to create awareness among them by explaining the obstacles in their progress. At the same time, it is necessary to bring positive changes in the minority youth and increase their participation in social progress.

Accordingly, in pursuance of Government Decision, Minority Development Department, dated 04.07.2016, guidelines have been issued for taking measures for economic, social, educational upliftment of minority youth and bringing about positive change in them.

Now, for the year 2018-19, the matter of selection of Urban Local Bodies for implementing all the schemes and facilities of the Government for the development of minorities was under consideration.
