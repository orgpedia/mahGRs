Reference:- 1) Solapur Municipal Corporation General Meeting Resolution No. 141, c. 29.08.1970 2) Solapur Municipal Corporation General Assembly Resolution No. 302, Sec. 18.02.2016 3) Commissioner, Solapur Municipal Corporation vide letter No. NA/ Y/ 539, dated 20.10.2021 Preamble:
In order to determine the taxable value of any building or land liable to levy property tax under Rule 7 (1) of Section 8 under Schedule D of the Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act, 1949, it is provided that an amount equal to 10% of the said annual rent shall be deducted from the amount of the annual rent at which such land or building is expected to be reasonably leasable from year to year. The Government had sent the draft notification dated 03.12.1969 to the Municipal Corporations seeking their comments by proposing to deduct 15% instead of 10% by amending the said provision.
The notification is in the form of a draft and has not been finalised. Meanwhile, in the absence of the final notification of the Government, the Solapur Municipal Corporation, vide its Resolution No. 141 dated 29.08.1970, at its level, amended the provisions of the said Act to deduct 15% instead of 10%.
In order to rectify the mistake in this regard, the Solapur Municipal Corporation had presented a proposal before the General Assembly and proposed to deduct 10 per cent as per the provisions of the Act, however, the General Assembly again approved the action in accordance with the previous resolution No. 141 dated 29.08.1970 by passing resolution No. 302 on 18.02.2016.
The Government is of the view that the said resolution is violative of the provisions of Section 451 (1) of the Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act, 1949 read with Rule 7 (1) of Section 8 under Schedule-D of the Act and therefore, the said resolution is liable to be quashed. Accordingly, the Government have decided as follows: GOVERNMENT DECISION: The matter in Resolution No. 141 dated 29.08.1970 and Resolution No. 302 dated 18.02.2016 passed in the general meeting of Solapur Municipal Corporation as per the provisions of Section 451 (1) of the Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act, 1949
