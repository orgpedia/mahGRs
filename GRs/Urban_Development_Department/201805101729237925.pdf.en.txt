Preamble: When the Thane Municipal Corporation appealed to the Standing Committee against the order of punishment given to the officers and engineers who were found guilty in the departmental inquiry regarding the irregularities committed by the officers and engineers in the utilization of Backward Classes Fund in the financial year 2008-09, the Standing Committee of the Thane Municipal Corporation issued a notice to the Standing Committee No. 1789, dated 31.03.2016.
Section 56 (1) (a) of the Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act provides that the Commissioner may impose any of the penalties specified in sub-section (2) clauses a, b, d, e and f on any officer appointed by the corporation. Since there is no provision in this provision to appeal to the Standing Committee against a sentence such as suspension or withholding of pay, the punishment in this case is a minor punishment. 1789, dated 31.03.2016 under section 451, the Commissioner, Thane Municipal Corporation has requested the Government to cancel the said resolution.
As per the Government Circular dated 03.07.1992, the Government has issued orders that the Municipal Corporation should withdraw 5% of the revenue as reserve fund from its revenue income and spend it for the welfare of weaker sections i.e. SC/ ST, Vimukt and Nomadic Tribes.
Accordingly, a provision of Rs. 23 crore was made in the Budget Estimates for the year 2008-09 under the head Backward Classes Fund Account for the works done by the Public Works Department. This provision was made available on the basis of the population of the backward class in the ward committee.
A preliminary inquiry was conducted into the matter after several serious administrative and financial irregularities were found during the distribution of" Backward Classes Fund" during the financial year 2008-2009, taking into account the ward-wise backward class population.
