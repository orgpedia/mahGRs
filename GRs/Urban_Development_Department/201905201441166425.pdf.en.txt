4. It is imperative to ensure that the collection, transportation and processing of solid waste in the city is carried out privately, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement signed with the concerned.
5. In the light of the facts set out in the above paragraph, the Government hereby make the following recommendations:
(1) When the collection, transportation and processing of solid waste in the city is carried out by contractors through outsourcing, all these works must be carried out in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract with the contractor concerned, and accordingly it is obligatory on the concerned Commissioner, Municipal Corporation/ Principal Municipal Council/ Nagar Panchayat to ensure that the works are done according to the terms and conditions of the contract before payment.
(2) While examining the payment submitted in respect of all these works, it is required to be ascertained that if the original contract includes all the three components of collection, transportation and processing of solid waste by the concerned private contractor, then in fact the works in respect of all these three components have been completed.
If this is not done, it would not be appropriate to provide for such incomplete work. Similarly, where only the collection and transportation of solid waste is being done privately (by outsourcing) by the contractor, it is necessary to ensure that both the collection and transportation of solid waste are completed, otherwise the work will be considered incomplete and no payment will be made for it.
(3) When the collection, transportation and processing of solid waste in the city is being carried out by a private contractor, a check list shall be prepared to ensure that all the steps required for such payment are completed before providing such payment and shall be examined in accordance with this check list. All the Commissioners, Municipal Corporations/ Principal Authorities, Municipal Councils/ Nagar Panchayats shall ensure that a competent mechanism and standard operating procedure is put in place to check such payments and ensure that the work is certified at each stage through the required mechanism. Thus, care should be taken that no payment is made without verification. (e.g. recording MB of construction work, inspecting it.)
Accordingly, a detailed procedure should be laid down as to how the payment is to be considered, how the consideration is to be refunded and then the payment is to be made. )
(4) In case of non-compliance with the terms and conditions of the contract, the payment of the contractor shall be made in person to the Commissioner, Municipal Corporation/ Chief Officer Municipal Council/ Nagar Panchayat concerned.
