Introduction: State government employees are required to perform their duties in a dynamic and efficient manner according to the changing times by constantly raising the standard of their work. If all the government officials/ employees take care of this, it will help the state government to become more dynamic and people-oriented. There was no scheme to honour outstanding officers/ employees based on objective criteria to motivate and encourage officers and staff to perform their duties more efficiently and dynamically. If the officers/ employees who have done excellent work in the administration are awarded with special awards, it will have an effective effect on all government officers/ employees and they will also be inspired to do their best work. Taking inspiration from Heroji Indulkar, who built impregnable and well-designed fort forts during the reign of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, the government was considering to implement an award scheme to honor the officers and employees who did excellent work by motivating the officers/ employees involved in the beautiful and linear planning of the cities, metros and regional divisions of the state to perform their duties efficiently and with full efficiency.
Government Decision: The Government has decided to start the" Swarajya Engineer Hiroji Indulkar" Meritorious Officer/ Employee Award Scheme from the financial year 2022-23 to honor the government officers and employees working in the Urban Development Department-1 (Self) establishment for the excellent work done in the Department of Town Planning and Valuation under the Urban Development Department.
