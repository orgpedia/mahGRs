Date: 11th of October 2018
The Urban Development Department is implementing various infrastructure projects in various cities of the State under the Centrally Sponsored Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM), UIDSSMT and UIG Udyan, AMRUT Mission and State Sponsored Maharashtra Suvarnajayanti Nagarotthan Mahabhiyan.
While implementing the projects through these schemes or while preparing the DPR of the said projects, the project is planned taking into account the required space for various components of the projects like water treatment plant for water supply projects, sewage treatment plant for sewerage projects, etc. However, after the actual project is approved, the sites are not actually available as per the design of the project or the reservation is not available for the purpose.
Water purification and sewage treatment plants are important components of the project, if space is not available for this component, then important projects for the city are not completed. As a result, people are deprived of basic facilities.
Such issues have been discussed at various levels of the government. Therefore, in order to avoid such problems in the future, the government was considering taking a decision not to provide any subsidy from various schemes of the state government until the necessary space is available for the sub-component of the projects of the urban local bodies.
Government's decision:
The Government has decided not to provide any grant from various schemes of the State Government till the required space is available for the sub-segment of projects of Urban Local Bodies from the Central and State Government schemes of the Urban Development Department as follows:
(a) the sites required for the sub-components of the projects (such as water treatment plants, sewage treatment plants, pumping stations, etc.) under various schemes of the Central Government, State Government, implemented by the Urban Local Bodies in the State, so far as the urban local bodies are concerned;
