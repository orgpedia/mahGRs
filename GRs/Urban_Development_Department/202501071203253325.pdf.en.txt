the Proposal. -
I. The rate of urbanization in the state of Maharashtra is 45.23%. Due to widespread urbanization, the pressure on 27 municipal corporations and 381 municipalities to provide civic amenities is increasing day by day. The urban population is gradually moving out of the city limits.
Il. There has been an increase in the number of congenial areas falling outside the municipal corporation area, which are not included in the municipal corporation / gram panchayat area. These areas are scheduled to be included in the Gram Panchayat / Municipality / Municipal Corporation limits in the future. However, the area is not provided with civic amenities until then, and the Trishanku area continues to grow unchecked and unplanned. They need to be prevented / planned before such civil problems can arise in the Trishanku Zones.
For this reason, a proposal is under consideration of the Government to constitute a committee under the chairmanship of the Additional Chief Secretary, Revenue Department as follows to identify and suggest solutions to the problems in the Trishanku sector in this regard.
0X. Government Orders: - Propose measures to address the problems in the trifurcated areas outside the municipal corporation area of the state, which are not covered by the municipal corporation / gram panchayat area, and to propose amendments to the existing laws. The Committee is being constituted as follows to prepare necessary Regulation B recommendations in this regard and submit its all-inclusive report to the Government, if required.

The time-bound schedule of the Committee in the aforesaid composition shall be as follows: -
There are some areas in the state of Maharashtra that are not covered by any municipal corporation / municipality or rural local body (RLB), these areas are commonly called Trishanku areas. These areas do not receive these civic amenities as no local body is legally authorized and responsible for providing civic services and facilities. The committee should examine these survey areas and make a proposal as to which local body should be included in such a tri-junction.
So that the citizens of the tri-junction can get the benefit of the services / facilities and services as provided by the local body for the citizen services within their jurisdiction.
Municipal corporations and gram panchayat areas around major cities in the state are areas that have the same developmental pressures and demand for facilities as urban areas. These Peri Urban Area SATA are unregulated and opaque developments due to the lack of administratively and economically strong local bodies in such areas, and the services are also not up to the mark. Soon these areas are expected to be included in the urban local body, at which point the urban area will be stressed by the earlier unauthorised and systematic development and the demand for regularisation and the need to provide civic amenities will have to be balanced. The said committee should propose, what system can be put in place from a legal and administrative point of view, so that these suburban areas do not have uncontrolled and unplanned growth and get the development funds they need, which will facilitate their inclusion in urban areas in the future.
The said committee should propose at least 100 TAHA HS (Growth Centres) across the state in order to prepare a development plan taking into account the pace of urbanization and the pressure of development.
The said Committee should make recommendations to the Government as and when required to amend the existing Act / Regulation or make new provisions.
The procedure of the Committee shall be determined on the direction of the Chairman of the said Committee. The committee meetings should be organised as per the instructions of the SSH Chairman. The meetings should be conducted by the Member Secretary of the Subordinate Action Committee.
V1. The said Committee may seek necessary information in coordination with experts on the subject, other departments of the Government as well as Municipal Corporations / Municipalities of the State as may be required. Also, the
