Preamble: Solapur Municipal Corporation In the General Meeting held on 09.01.2018, Resolution No. 71 has been passed in which it has been decided to make 9 wards instead of 8 for Solapur Municipal Corporation. However, as per the provisions of the Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act, 1949, Section No. As the resolution is not in the financial interest of the corporation, the Commissioner has decided to dissolve the resolution as per the provision of section 451. The recommendation was made to the Government vide letter dated 12.02.2018.
As the divisional office has to be structured according to the ward for the convenience of administrative work, Section 29 (a) (1) of the Municipal Corporation Act, 1949 provides for a maximum of 9 wards for a population of 4.50 lakh to 12.00 lakh. Also, there is a provision of 1 ward for every 1.5 lakh population for additional population.
Solapur city has a population of 9.51 lakh as of 2011 and accordingly 7 wards are completed taking into account the provisions of the Act. For the remaining 0.51 lakh population and considering the increase in population in the last 7 years and in view of the geographical contiguity and administrative control over the day-to-day affairs in the area of Solapur Municipal Corporation, 8 wards are expected to be identified.
However, since the corporation has decided to have 9 wards, it will have to provide 1 divisional office, office building, ward officers, other necessary staff for the same. This is not financially viable for the city. Therefore, as the resolution as per Section 29-A (1) of the Act is against the public interest, the Municipal Corporation will not be able to hold the general meeting as per Section 451 (2) of the Act. Resolution passed on 09.01.2018 No. 71 to break up.
