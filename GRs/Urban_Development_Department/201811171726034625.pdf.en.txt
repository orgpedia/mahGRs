Government Resolution No:- MUN-2018/ P.S.No.197/ NV-18
Madam Cama Marg, Hutatma Rajguru Chowk,
Ministry, Mumbai- 400 032.
Date: 17th of November 2018
The Proposal:
The Central and State Governments have embarked on an ambitious mission to provide houses to all homeless families by 2022. For this, the Central Government has approved the implementation of the Centrally Sponsored Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana in 382 cities and adjoining planning areas of the state. Under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, beneficiaries in urban areas are selected on the basis of their ownership and annual income and the approved action plan is implemented through an operational mechanism. However, if an eligible beneficiary who does not own land or is an encroacher on any type of government land under the jurisdiction of the Revenue Department, has to build his own house, he has no other option and therefore, providing such government land to him will help in the implementation of the scheme immediately.
The Hon'ble Cabinet in its meeting dated 13/11/2018 has taken a policy decision to regularize the encroachments on all types of Government lands under the Revenue Department in the State for residential purposes and to ensure that the encroachers who are eligible for Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana get the benefit of this scheme. The government was contemplating issuing guidelines in this regard. Accordingly, the following guidelines have been issued:
GOVERNMENT DECISION: The following Committees are being constituted to take action to regularize the encroachments of the encroachers who are eligible for benefits under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana and who have encroached on all types of government lands under the Revenue Department for residential purposes. :
