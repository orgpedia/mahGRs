Detailed guidelines have been issued as per the decision. As per the above reference, the street vendors in the city and those who come to the city from the surrounding areas of the city and sell the street, have to apply for a Letter of Recommendation (LoR) to take advantage of this scheme. Since most of the street vendors are migrants, their domicile certificate and the fact that the resident is from an urban local body should not be insisted upon while scrutinising their applications. Also, no other documents other than the ones mentioned in the scheme should be asked for.
