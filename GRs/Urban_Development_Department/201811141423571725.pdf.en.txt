Under the Mission, the two major components are to make the cities" open defecation free" by providing individual household toilets or community toilets to the households in the cities who do not have access to toilets, to transport 100% segregated waste generated in the city under Solid Waste Management by segregating it at source (wet and dry), to treat wet waste centrally or in a decentralized manner and to make the city" clean."

In order to speed up the implementation of Swachh Maharashtra Mission and to give due respect to the cities which have become open defecation free and clean, it has been decided to give incentive grant as per the category of cities. This was done in pursuance of the Government Decision dated 28.03.2016.

3. The certification of open defecation free cities is done by the Central Government. With a view to maintain the status of Open Defecation Free cities, the Central Government is re-examining every six months every city that has become Open Defecation Free. Therefore, it was under the consideration of the government to link the stages of distribution of incentive subsidy given by the state government for open defecation free with the stages of re-testing of the city's open defecation free.
Government's decision:
Considering the points mentioned in the Preamble, the cities which have been declared Open Defecation Free under Swachh Maharashtra Abhiyan are referred to Reference No. The Government hereby approves the distribution of 40% of the subsidy admissible in the third phase in four phases, retaining the first and second phases of the incentive subsidy distribution as stipulated in the Government Decision dated 30.01.2017 as follows:
