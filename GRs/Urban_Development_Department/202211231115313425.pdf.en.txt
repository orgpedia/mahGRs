The Proposal:
The Maharashtra Suvarna Jayanti Nagarotthan Abhiyan is being implemented under the provisions of the Government Resolution No. 1 in the context of providing basic infrastructure in the urban areas of the state and raising their standards.
The Sewerage (Phase-II) Project of Vaijapur Municipal Council under Maharashtra Golden Jubilee Urban Mission has been given technical approval by the Chief Engineer, Maharashtra Life Authority, Aurangabad as per the current schedule. Accordingly, as per the recommendation of the State Level Project Approval Committee in its meeting held on 31st October, 2022, the matter of granting administrative approval to the said project was under consideration of the Government.
Government's decision:
The sewerage (Phase-II) project of Vaijapur Municipal Council submitted under the Maharashtra Golden Jubilee Urban Mission is being approved by this Government decision as mentioned in the following statement subject to the terms and conditions of the relevant Government decision and the technical approval given by the Maharashtra Life Authority.
The State Government has decided to implement the Sewerage Project in two phases, considering the limit of funds for the implementation of the Sewerage Project and to focus on the creation of sewage treatment capacity on priority basis. The decision was taken on December 31, 2018. According to this policy, in the first phase, the sewage generated at present should be treated on priority by creating a sewage treatment system according to the future needs. The STP capacity required to treat the entire waste water should be sanctioned in the first phase. These include a sewage treatment plant, a sewage treatment plant, a water supply station and a sewage treatment plant. Along with this, arrangements should also be made to collect waste water in some of the different wards of the city. For the rest of the ward, the sewage from the Trunk Main should be collected in a drain and the drain should be blocked near the Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) and the sewage should be taken to the Sewage Treatment Plant at that place and treated. In the second phase, a sewerage system should be constructed and connected to the sewage treatment system created in the first phase. The state government has adopted a policy that this phase will include second-level sewers. Accordingly, the Sillod City Sewerage (Phase-II) Project is being approved for implementation in a phase-wise manner. The details of the project and its cost are as follows:
