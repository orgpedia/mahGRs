Introduction: The monsoon season is the peak period for many epidemics. This period often sees an increase in water-borne as well as insect-borne diseases. Contaminated water in the municipal councils and municipal corporation areas of the state, lack of sanitation in the area, has been seen to increase the incidence of epidemics and the main reason for this is also the unclean water supply.
In the monsoon season, epidemics such as swine flu, malaria, chikungunya, etc., increase during this period, and leptospirosis in the Konkan belt region may increase during this period. The Department of Public Health, vide its circular dated 01.07.2016, has issued detailed instructions for surveillance and control of various epidemics as well as subsequent outbreaks of epidemics.
Public Interest Litigation No. In 237/2014. The High Court has issued the following directions in pursuance of the judgment dated 25th October, 2016: - Municipal Corporations should take immediate steps, to contain various diseases namely Malaria, Dengue etc. And to take steps to ensure that there is eradication of these diseases. For that purpose, we direct the state government and all the municipal corporations to ensure that emphasis is given on prevention of these diseases by taking appropriate steps such as fumigation on regular basis every day and removal of stagnant water wherever-ever it is found. There has to be an appropriate garbage disposal plant which is another source for the spread of these diseases.
In view of the above, a proposal was under consideration of the government to take measures in the local bodies to contain the spread of epidemics.
