The Proposal:

In order to create awareness among the people to encourage them to participate in Swachh Maharashtra Abhiyan and to enhance the sustainable capacity of cities in terms of cleanliness and sanitation and to increase the collective participation of people from all sections of the society in the journey towards Swachh Maharashtra, the Central Government is conducting a survey of 4237 Urban Local Bodies in the country in line with Swachhta.
The survey is being conducted in two groups- Amrit Cities and Non-Amrit Cities. The ranking of AMRUT cities will be decided by ranking 500 cities at the national level. This includes 43 cities in the state. Non-Amrit towns have been divided into five zones and Maharashtra has been included in the western zone. The Western Zone comprises 1017 cities in the states of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Goa, Rajasthan and the Union Territory of Daman and Diu.
