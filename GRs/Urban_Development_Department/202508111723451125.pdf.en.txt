The Proposal:
Section 267-A of the Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act, 1949 provides for the imposition of penalties for illegal constructions within the municipal limits. In accordance with the
Illegal constructions are penalized by the municipal corporations.
There is a sense of frustration among property owners about paying the penalty as the amount of illegal construction fees in the Thane Municipal Corporation area is higher than the original tax. As the property owner is not paying even the basic tax along with the penalty in the hope that the penalty will be waived in the future, as a result, the tax revenue of the corporation is decreasing. Also, property tax arrears
It's growing. Therefore, the government was considering waiving the penalty for illegal constructions in the Thane Municipal Corporation limits with a view to waiving the penalty so that the basic tax would be paid and the permanent income would increase.
The government's decision:
The penalty was imposed under Section 267-A of the Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act, 1949, on illegal constructions within the limits of the Thane Municipal Corporation. The Government has decided to waive the penalty due up to 31st March, 2025 subject to the following conditions and conditions: 1. Illegal construction property holders will be required to pay the principal tax in full first.
The pending penalty will then be waived.
The Thane Municipal Corporation area is governed by the Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act, 1949, Section 267-A. The pending penalty up to 31st March, 2025 is being waived off.
