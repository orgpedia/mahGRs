If 297/1 and S. No. 305 are moved from the common boundary, it is seen that most of the construction of the approved drawing of the Yeshwanthnagar Society is affected by the proposed design of the planned 9.00 m road. Also, the proposed plot in Gunthewari in the premises of Sri Krishna Cooperative Housing Society (S. No. 297/1) is yet to be regularized by the Municipal Corporation.
