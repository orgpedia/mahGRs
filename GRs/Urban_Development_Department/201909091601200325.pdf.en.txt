During the' Swachhata Hi Seva" campaign, citizens, other organizations and units should clean up every possible place in the city through Shramdaan, so that every nook and corner of the city can get a glimpse of being plastic free. Also, this will enable a real" Jan Andolan" in the cities. A list of activities that can be undertaken during the campaign, including citizen participation and Information, Education and Communication (IEC) during Shramdaan, is attached as Annexure-I.
Also, the list of activities to be undertaken while celebrating public events and making cities plastic-free is attached in Annexure-II.
Since all the above activities will be monitored at the highest level, the photos/ videos before the activities and the photos/ videos after the activities and the details of the activities should be uploaded on Swachhata Mancha.

The entire city should be free of banned plastic. On October 2, 2019, a comprehensive campaign should be launched to collect plastic. The local body should store the collected plastic at the Material Recovery Facility (Material Restoration Centre). Then the plastic collected from October 3 to October 27, 2019 should be sent to the recycling center, the plastic that cannot be recycled should be given to the cement companies.

All the local bodies in every district should make arrangements to send the non-recyclable plastic collected by them to the plastic collection centre of the local body in their district. Non-recyclable plastic should be stored in the bell with the help of a baling machine and ensure that there is water and fire safety equipment. Local bodies should use non-recyclable plastic while constructing their roads, and the Public Works Department should also use this plastic while constructing their roads.
