A letter of 1 is requested.
Mr. Nitin Bhoi, Water Director, Thane Municipal Corporation was absent without permission for 8 years and 7 months from 03.05.2007. A memorandum was issued by the Thane Municipal Corporation regarding the absence of Mr. Bhoi without a license. They were given ample opportunity to present their views. But there has been no response to the notice. In view of the above, as Shri Nitin Bhoi was found to be negligent towards his service and not serious about his administrative work, a departmental inquiry was conducted against him by the Thane Municipal Corporation regarding the absence of Shri Bhoi without license. He was given an opportunity to present his case at the hearing. However, Mr. Nitin Bhoi did not submit any joint cause in the departmental inquiry.
The Thane Municipal Corporation has punished Mr. Bhoi by reducing him from service and making him absent without licence for a period of time without pay as the charges against him were fully proved. Regarding the punishment given to Bhoi, Mr. Bhoi had filed an appeal to the Chairman, Standing Committee, Thane Municipal Corporation within the stipulated time. The standing committee accepted the appeal. 1654, dated 23.03.2016. In the said resolution, the Standing Committee has approved the revocation of the sentence imposed on Shri Bhoi under Section 56 (4) of the Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act.
However, since the punishment awarded to Mr. Bhoi was in compliance with the procedure prescribed under the Maharashtra Civil Services (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1979, and since the Standing Committee was not empowered to invoke the provisions of Section 56 (4) of the Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act against him, the punishment was beyond the scope of the Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act. 1654 dated 23.03.2016 Commissioner, Thane Municipal Corporation has submitted the said resolution to the Government for its repeal.
