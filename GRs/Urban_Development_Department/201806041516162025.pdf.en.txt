These recommendations are being reviewed.
The Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) will not have to make any initial capital investment while installing LED street lights on Esco basis through EESL. Therefore, there will be no capital expenditure from the 14th Finance Commission funds or from self-funding, in addition to the government funds, for installing LD street lights.
