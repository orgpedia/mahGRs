GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: SANKIRN-2018/ PR No. 01/ NV-16 dated 16th October, 2018.
The Municipal Councils of (1) Trimbak, (2) Alandi, (3) Jejuri, (4) Pandharpur, (5) Tuljapur and (6) Ramtek in the State have decided to discontinue the collection of pilgrim tax from the pilgrims coming to the places of pilgrimage in their area and have issued reference No. (1) The Government had decided to give subsidy to the said Municipalities under the decision of the Government. Also Reference No. (2) In pursuance of the decision of the Government herein, the Government have decided to make the grant of pilgrim tax admissible to the Paithan Municipal Council also and as such, the total number of municipal councils in the State for which the grant of pilgrim tax is admissible is now seven. Considering the gradual increase in the expenditure incurred by the respective Municipal Councils for providing minimum necessary facilities to the devotees, the Government has decided to increase the amount of pilgrim tax subsidy from Rs. (3) to (6) has been extended from time to time in accordance with the Government Decision. The matter of applying the Yatra Tax subsidy to the Akkalkot Municipal Council was under the consideration of the Government.
The demand for the implementation of the government decision to apply the subsidy to the Akkalkot Municipal Council is constantly being made by the concerned Municipal Council/ Local Public Fund. Considering the importance of these pilgrimage sites and the large number of yatras that take place here, as well as the daily rush of devotees, the municipal councils have to provide minimum facilities (such as sanitation, water supply, health, roads, lighting and other ancillary infrastructure) to the devotees. As a result, the limited income of the respective municipal councils is stressed. Providing minimum facilities to the devotees coming to this Municipal Council is not possible in the absence of limited income. For this purpose, Rs. The Government have decided to implement a subsidy of Rs. 2,00,00, 000/- (Rupees Two Crores only).
