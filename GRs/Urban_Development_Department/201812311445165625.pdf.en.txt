GOVERNMENT DECISION Urban Development Department No: 2016/ PR No.259/ NV-33, dated 30th November, 2017
The Proposal:
Among the sewerage projects implemented by the urban local bodies in the state through various schemes, the lack of possession of sewerage center (STP) space, the completion of collection system works without completing the work of sewerage center (STP), etc. were noticed. This has resulted in delay in the execution of projects and non-achievement of expected results from the capital expenditure of the project.
Also, since the cost of the sewerage project is comparatively higher than the water supply scheme, and if there are problems like the above, the government's money gets stuck in it to a great extent and the expected results are also not achieved.
Considering the increasing urbanization of the state and the strong demand for sewerage projects from the urban local bodies of the state in terms of environment, and the corresponding limits of funds available with the government, it was necessary to take concrete decisions in order to achieve the expected results from the sewerage scheme within the limits of available funds. Accordingly, the Waste Water Treatment Recycling and Reuse Policy of the State Government was framed vide Government Resolution dated 30.11.2017.
As per this policy, a step-wise strategy for implementation of sewerage projects has been prescribed. In line with that policy, the state government was considering to take a decision on the implementation of sewerage projects sanctioned under the Maharashtra Suvarna Jayanti Nagarothana Mahaabhiyan in two phases.

Government's decision:
Considering the facts mentioned in the preamble, the government has decided to implement the sewerage projects sanctioned under the Maharashtra Suvarna Jayanti Nagarothana Mahaabhiyan in two phases as follows.
1) In principle approval should be given to the entire scheme of the sewerage project of the concerned city under the Maharashtra Suvarnajayanti Nagarotthan Mahabhiyan.
2) However, the implementation of sewerage projects is not possible. With the approval of the State Cabinet, the wastewater treatment should be carried out in two phases as per the Recycling and Recycling Policy of the State Government prescribed vide Government Resolution dated 30th November, 2017.
In the first phase, 100% treatment capacity, sewage collection system in the most urbanized wards of the city and Nala Interception system for the rest of the wards should be created. This will create the capacity to treat 100% of the sewage generated in the city. Accordingly, Phase-I should be given administrative approval at present.
In the second phase:- After the completion of the works of Phase-1 and the entire sewage treatment plants become operational, the work of connecting the sewerage system of the remaining zones of the respective city to the sewage treatment system created in the first phase should be taken up. Such works should be approved by the government as Phase-II on the tariff list for that year.
After the completion of the first and second phases, it will be the responsibility of the concerned implementing agency to ensure that 100 percent of the city's sewage is treated with the necessary coordination.
6) The sewerage projects of Saswad, Rajgurunagar, Tasgaon, Gangapur and Vaijapur cities recommended by the State Level Project Approval Committee constituted under the Maharashtra Suvarna Jayanti Nagarothana Mahaabhiyan have been approved by the Government as per the above prescribed concept.
7) The projects will be approved as per the same policy while implementing the future sewerage projects under the Maharashtra Suvarnajayanti Nagarotthan Mahabhiyan. Therefore, the concerned Urban Local Bodies should take the above concepts into consideration while preparing the Detailed Project Report (DPR) of their sewerage project.
