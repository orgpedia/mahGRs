Therefore, the respective local bodies/ municipal corporations should acquire the land by issuing TDR. If necessary, the development plan should be changed.

After receiving the proposal through the concerned Collector, it should be given administrative approval with government approval after being approved by the State Level Project Approval Committee constituted at the state government level.
10. Funds to be distributed for this purpose should be distributed mainly in three phases. The first tranche of funds should be released by the state government after administrative approval for such funds. The funds required for land acquisition for this purpose should be made available to the concerned land holder by setting up a fund on the account of the Urban Local Body in proportion to the funds distributed by the State Government.
(11) The funds of the first instalment and the corresponding amount of the share of the Urban Local Body shall be made available to the Urban Local Body after the Urban Local Body submits its utilization certificate to the land holder concerned and furnishes the details of the possession of the land to the Government.
12. It shall be the sole responsibility of the concerned Collector and the Commissioner/ Principal of the Urban Local Body to ensure that the project work does not get delayed due to the acquisition of the required space within the prescribed time frame by planning the funds as above.

The compensation to be paid for rehabilitation of unauthorised occupants should be dealt with separately as per the decision to be taken on the basis of the report of the Committee appointed under the Government Resolution dated 04.09.2017 under the Chairmanship of Principal Secretary, Revenue.
16. The proposal is that despite receiving huge funds from the Union Ministry, the land acquisition cost will not be admissible for any of the components (STP/ WTP etc.) in the projects taken up regularly through Nagarothana Abhiyan as the land acquisition works to be done by the Municipal Corporations/ Municipal Councils are being taken up for completing the incomplete projects.
