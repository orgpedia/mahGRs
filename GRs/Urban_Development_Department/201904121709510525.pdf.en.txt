Government Circular No:- TANNIA-2018/ PR No.53/ NV-31
Mantralaya, Mumbai- 400 032
The date: April 12, 2019.
The Proposal:
As per the provisions of the Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act, 1949 and the Bombay Municipal Corporation Act, 1888, in order to curb financial irregularities in the municipal corporations, a provision has been made to conduct an internal audit and submit its report to the standing committee. However, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, in its Local Bodies Report 2016-17, has pointed out that the provisions relating to internal audit are not being strictly implemented. For effective implementation of the internal control system in the Municipal Corporations, the provisions of the Act in this regard need to be strictly followed. In this background, the government was contemplating to issue fresh instructions to all the municipal corporations in this regard.
Government circular:
As per Section 105 and 106 of the Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act, 1949 and Sections 135 to 137 of the Bombay Municipal Corporation Act, 1888, the Chief Auditor of the Municipal Corporation shall audit the accounts of the Municipal Corporation and submit its report to the Standing Committee of the Municipal Corporation. In this report, if the Chief Auditor of the Municipal Corporation finds any error, significant impropriety or irregularity in the expenditure or collection of the Municipal Corporation, he is obliged to express his opinion in the report to be submitted to his standing committee. However, it has been pointed out that the process of internal audit and authentication of accounts is not being done effectively by the chief auditor of the municipal corporation. In this regard, instructions have been issued to all the District Transport Officers of the State.
(1) All the Municipal Corporations of the State shall forthwith complete the pending verification and audit of the accounts from them as per the provisions of the Municipal Corporation Act and take action to submit such audit report to the Standing Committee with their specific opinion as per the provisions of the Act.
