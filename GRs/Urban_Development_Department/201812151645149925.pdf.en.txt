Government Resolution, Urban Development Department, No.SWMA 2015/ No. 23/ NV-34, dated 15th May, 2015. No.31/ NV-34, dated 17th March, 2017 3. Circular to the Government, Urban Development Department, No. 263/ NV-34, dated 30th December, 2017 Government Decision: Swachh Maharashtra Mission is being implemented in the State on the lines of Swachh Bharat Mission of the Central Government. Under the Mission, the two major components are to make the cities" Open Defecation Free" by providing individual or community toilets to households in the cities who do not have access to toilets and to make the cities" Clean" by managing the city's solid waste as per the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016. Accordingly, under this campaign, the entire urban area of the state has become open defecation free by providing toilet facilities to the families in the state who do not have access to toilets. In order to sustain the status of" Open Defecation Free City" of all these Open Defecation Free Urban Local Bodies, it is necessary to provide individual toilet facilities to as many families as possible and to manage the sewage in the toilet safety tanks.
Total 35 cities in the state have full or partial sewerage system and Sewerage Treatment Plants (STP). The list of these cities has been attached as Annexure-I with this Government decision.
While making the cities open defecation free under Swachh Maharashtra Abhiyan, toilets in the areas where sewerage system exists in the cities have been connected to the sewerage system with a view to managing sewage. So, toilets in areas/ cities where sewerage system is not in place have been connected to the safety tank. Toilets that are connected to the sewerage system are being processed at the Sewerage Treatment Plants (STP) in the respective cities. However, in view of the need for safe and regular management and processing of sewage in the toilets of the cities/ towns which are not connected to the sanitary tanks due to non-availability of sewerage system, the Government hereby order as under: 1) In order to ensure safe and regular management and processing of sewage in the toilets of the cities where Sewage Treatment Plants (STP) are in existence but where the sewerage system is not available in some areas, the sanitary tanks of the toilets shall be emptied by vacuuming the sanitary tanks of these toilets with vacuum emitter after a period of time.
