The grant will be in addition to the grant of Rs.12,000/- per beneficiary from the Central and State Governments for construction of individual toilets under Swachh Maharashtra Mission and the local body's share from the 14th Finance Commission funds.
The District Level Committee should also approve such proposals while considering the proposal received from the concerned local bodies for the distribution of grants received from the State Government under the Sahityaratna Janadhikar Anna Bhau Sathe Urban Habitat Improvement Scheme. Such proposals should be considered on priority by the district level committee to make the entire urban Maharashtra open defecation free.
