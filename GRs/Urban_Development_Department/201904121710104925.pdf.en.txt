The Department of Urban Development,
Government Circular No:- LOLES-2018/ PR No.11/ NV-31,
Ministry, Mumbai 400 032.
The date: April 12, 2019.
The Proposal:
The Comptroller and Auditor General of India's testimony before the Public Accounts Committee on the Appropriation Accounts Report for the year 2013-14 has also recommended instructions to the Sub-Control Officers of the Department to take action from time to time in respect of reconciliation of the accumulated expenditure and correction of the change of account/ wrong entry as per the procedure prescribed in the Budget Booklet. Accordingly, the proposal was under consideration.
Government circular:
As per Rule 162 (a) and (b) of the Maharashtra Budget Rulebook, the expenditure is to be met by the respective Controlling Officers and an updated list of Controlling Officers appointed for various schemes is published by the Government every year. Instructions have been given to complete the work of reconciliation of the accumulated expenses of the financial year within the stipulated time.
However, it has been observed that some of the Controlling Authorities are not completing the balance sheet of the transactions carried out during the relevant financial year on time. If you do the work of reconciling the accumulated expenses of the current financial year on time, it is noticed that the expenses have been recorded on the wrong account. If the Accountant General's Office detects a wrong entry before closing the accounts for the relevant year, it may be informed about the transfer entry in time. However, after the closure of the accounts, the Accountant General's Office has to submit the proposals of the wrong record correction (Note of Error) to the Accountant General's Office by the government after it finds that the expenditure has been recorded on the wrong account.
(2) The proceedings relating to reconciliation of expenditure and correction of alteration/ misstatement in the Appropriation Accounts Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India for the year 2013-14 before the Public Accounts Committee as prescribed in the Budget Book.
