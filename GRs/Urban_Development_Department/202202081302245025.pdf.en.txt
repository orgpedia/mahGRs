Government Decision: The Municipal Councils of Barshi, Goregaon and Bhadgaon have decided to implement the Urban Solid Waste Management Project in terms of Reference No. The decisions 2, 3 and 4 were approved by the government. BS4 vehicles were included in the project. However, since BS4 has been discontinued and BS6 vehicles have been used instead, the request to include BS6 vehicles instead of BS4 vehicles included in the project was made through the municipal councils.
The proposal submitted by the Municipal Councils has been submitted for the approval of the High Power Committee held on 8/11/2021 and it has been approved by the High Power Committee. As per the approval of the High Powered Committee, the Government is approving the purchase of BS6 vehicles instead of BS4 vehicles mentioned in the Detailed Project Report of Barshi, Goregaon and Bhadgaon Municipal Councils for the management of Urban Solid Waste at the prices mentioned in the statement accompanying this decision. As a result of this change, the increased expenditure in the Detailed Project Report for Solid Waste Management of Municipal Councils should be met from the funds received under the 14th Finance Commission or from self-funding.
(3) It shall be obligatory to comply with the terms and conditions mentioned in the administrative approval decision at reference No. 2.
