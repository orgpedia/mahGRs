Kolhapur Municipal Corporation Resolution No. 62, dated 19/03/2018
The Proposal:
Kolhapur Municipal Corporation City Water Supply Department has been transferred from Maharashtra Water Supply and Drainage Board (presently Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran) on 01/01/1992. The class III and IV employees of the Water Supply and Drainage Board working on this scheme have been transferred to the Municipal Corporation on a permanent basis. However, officers of Class-I and Class-II cadre were being made available on deputation from the Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran with effect from 01/01/1992 without transfer. However, the Member Secretary, Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran vide their letter dated 27/10/2016, dated 11/01/2017 and dated 08/11/2017 has informed the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation that it will not be possible to provide officers from Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran on deputation anymore.
Therefore, as Class-1 and Class-2 officers will not be available on deputation from Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran for Kolhapur Municipal City Water Supply Scheme, the Commissioner has submitted a proposal to create 15 new posts as per the provisions of Section 51 (4) of the Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Acts, under the government's approval, under the Reference Letter No. 1 to 3 and requested to approve the proposal.
The General Assembly of the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation passed a resolution No. 3 for the creation of this post. 62 dated 19/03/2018 has been approved.
As per the request of the Commissioner, the government was considering the creation of 15 new posts of Class-1 and Class-2 cadre officer on the establishment of Kolhapur Municipal City Water Supply Department.
