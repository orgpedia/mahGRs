Government Circular No:- Narikari- 2019/ PR No. 165/ NV-33
Mantralaya, Mumbai- 400 032
The date: November 2, 2020.
The Proposal:
The infrastructure projects are being implemented by the state government through the Urban Local Bodies (ULBs). However, since the financial position of the Urban Local Bodies is not in a position to undertake the project works, the Urban Local Bodies have to raise loans from other financial institutions/ banks. However, the urban local bodies are finding it difficult to raise loans. Therefore, the Maharashtra Urban Infrastructure Fund (MUNFRA) Trust has been established under Government Decision No. MRD-1501/ PR No. 252/ NV-10, dated 19.07.2002 to assist in raising loans for the project being implemented by the Urban Local Bodies. This soft loan scheme is being implemented with the objective of motivating the urban local bodies to take up development works by taking loans for at least some of the works by discouraging them from spending only by taking grants from the government. Accordingly, the Maharashtra Urban Infrastructure Development Company (MUIDC) was under the consideration of the government to provide funds for providing loans to urban local bodies.
Government's decision:
The Maharashtra Urban Infrastructure Fund Trustee Company Limited (MUIFTCL) has been entrusted with the task of providing funds to the Maharashtra Urban Infrastructure Development Company Limited (MUIDCO) under the Maharashtra Urban Infrastructure Fund (MUIF).
(a) The Urban Local Bodies in the State are provided grants under various schemes by the Urban Development Department. Under the Maharashtra Urban Infrastructure Fund Trustee Company Limited (MUIFTCL), the Maharashtra Urban Infrastructure Development Company Limited (MUIDCL) is being made available to the Maharashtra Urban Infrastructure Development Company Limited (MUIDCL) for providing loans up to 1% of the sanctioned budget of the Urban Development Department or a maximum of Rs.
(b) in the subsequent years, the amount available for making loans from the company to the company in the relevant year, before the above funds are made available to the company
