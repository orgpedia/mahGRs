Madam Cama Marg, Martyr Rajguru Chowk,
Mantralaya, Mumbai - 400 032.
Date: 23rd September, 2025.
Reference: - 1. Letter from Commissioner, Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation No. 19.12.2019
2. Letter from Commissioner, Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation No. 21.05.2025
Introduction: - CIDCO has constructed flats of different area for citizens of different income groups while settling in the city of Navi Mumbai. Among them, CIDCO has divided the flats and squares developed for the low-income group into small condominiums. These flats have been given to the flat holders by CIDCO on a 60-year lease. The flat owners' association in this condominium is registered under the Maharashtra Ownership Act 1970 (ID1).
Such associations and the landlords under their jurisdiction have been empowered to charge a subscription for maintenance and repairs and thereby maintain and repair the buildings. However, the lease agreement of the colonies under these condominiums is for a period of 60 years and since the original owner is assumed to be Sidcoach, these old buildings have been provided with internal infrastructure facilities such as a condominium. Related services like sewerage / water supply etc. are required to be provided.
Section 165, 167 and 192 of the Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act provide that the Commissioner has the power to compel the owner / occupier concerned to make drainage arrangements. However, it does not include condominium works. Also, the circular of the Urban Development Department No. AMC 14200/2264 Q. No.144 / NV-24, D. According to the 26.01.2001, the work of private organization / cooperative organization / individual beneficiaries cannot be done from ward or corporator funds. However, the flat constructions in the condominium date back about 25 to 30 years. As a result, the water lines and sewerage lines in the premises of the building have become obsolete near Jabal due to the expiry of their life and the residents of the building have been complaining to the municipal corporation about the inadequate water supply and frequent choke-ups of the sewerage lines.

Replacement of water channels and sewerage lines in condominiums will cost a lot
The civic body is unable to lift the work as it is not possible for the low-income group flat holders there.
