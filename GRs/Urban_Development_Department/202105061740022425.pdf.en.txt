Preamble: In line with the Swachh Bharat Mission of the Central Government, the Government of the State under the decision of Reference No. 1
The Swachh Maharashtra Abhiyan is being implemented in the state. Under the Mission, the two major components are to make the cities" Open Defecation Free" by providing individual or community toilets to households in the cities who do not have access to toilets, and to make the cities" Clean" by managing the city's solid waste as per the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016.
2. After all the cities in the State become Open Defecation Free, these cities are being made" ODF+" in order to ensure continuity of Open Defecation Free status and better toilet facilities to the citizens of the cities. Henceforth, the citizens of the state are required to achieve" ODF++" status by ensuring safe and regular management of sewage in the septic tanks of the toilets in the cities along with better toilet facilities.
3. Under Swachh Maharashtra Mission, while making cities open defecation free, the toilets in the areas where sewerage system exists in the cities should be connected to the sewerage system from the point of view of sewage management.
have come. So, toilets in areas/ cities where sewerage system is not in place have been connected to the safety tank. Toilets that are connected to the sewer system
The process is being carried out at Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) in the respective cities. However, in the areas/ towns where sewerage system is not available, the toilets which have been connected to the safety tanks
The sewage from the sanitary tanks of toilets in such areas/ cities needs to be safely and regularly managed and processed.

4. Safe and regular management of sewage in septic tanks of toilets in 73 cities of the state is being done. Since the sludge in septic tanks in the rest of the cities needs to be processed by safe and regular management and for this, it is necessary to select the appropriate technology and implement the technology, therefore, under the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed with the Centre for Environmental Planning and Technology (CEPT), Ahmedabad under the Swachh Maharashtra Mission, this organization has selected the technology of Sludge Drying Bed (SDB) to process the sludge in septic tanks and based on that, the sludge in the septic tank can be processed by setting up a FSTP. 7 here. The administrative approval has been accorded vide Government Resolution dated 8.11.2019.
The option of scheduled desludging has come up in the meantime, according to which, if the city's dirt is to be processed, then each city will have to build a high-capacity FSTP plant and new technology is needed due to lack of space. Implementing technology
It was found that more space was required to implement the project. At present, some urban local bodies in the state do not have any land of their own. Therefore, Hybrid Core Technology, which can be implemented in the least space, is referred to as Reference No. 8 here. The approval has been granted as per the Government Resolution dated 19.4.2021.
The government was considering granting administrative approval for the construction of Fist Processing Centers (FSTP) using hybrid core technology in urban local bodies in the state.
Government's decision:
Considering the points mentioned in the Preamble, the Maharashtra Jeevan Authority vide its letter No. Majipra/ Manisansakaksha/ Nagari/ 136/ 2021 D.
