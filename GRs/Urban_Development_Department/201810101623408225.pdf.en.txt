Therefore, he had an idea that the proposal would be spent from the amount of funds available to the backward classes.
2) No separate register was maintained in the ward and hence the additional proposal of backward class fund was approved.
3. What is the amount of backward class fund available for those habitations while recommending the proposal from the backward class fund? This was not considered in the investigation.
The responsibility of supervision and control was of the executive engineer and deputy engineer in each ward committee.

An appeal was made to the committee. The Standing Committee No. 1789 dated 31.03.2016 reads as follows:
" It is the duty of the site supervisor and the junior engineer to inspect the work as per the instructions of the superiors and prepare a proposal accordingly. Proposals for more than the stipulated amount have also been cancelled. Hence, there is no financial loss or wastage of backward class funds.
The duty of the Deputy Engineer and the Executive Engineer is to forward the proposals submitted by the site supervisor and the Junior Engineer to the headquarters after necessary examination and looking at the accounting provisions therein, for recording the provision of capital, if any, and for further action, and it appears that they have acted accordingly. Also, the intention of the deputy engineer and executive engineer to misuse or waste the funds of the corporation is not visible by keeping the proposal pending until further decision after it was found that the proposal of more than the provision was registered in the headquarters. The inquiry report also stated that there was no financial loss to the corporation.
Considering the fact that the Inquiry Officer has prepared the work proposals as per the provisions of the township wise and that the Backward Classes Fund is not getting lapsed, it is ensured that the proposals are not submitted in excess of the available funds taking into account the declared balance of the Backward Classes Fund during the previous year 2007-08 and accordingly it is concluded that the allegations levelled against the above mentioned 11 officers/ engineers are not proved.
Accordingly, the 11 officers/ engineers were declared innocent.
Therefore, the punishment meted out to the above-mentioned site supervisors, junior engineers and executives of the administration appears to be severe in nature. Therefore, after discussing and deliberating on the matter, 10 site supervisors and junior engineers, as well as 10 deputy engineers and executive engineers, have been appointed under the Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act Rule No. The Standing Committee approves the abolition of the punishment under Section 56 (4). "
Section 56 (1) (a) of the Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act provides that the Commissioner may impose any of the penalties specified in sub-section (2) clauses a, b, d, e and f on any officer appointed by the corporation. There is no provision in the said Rules for appeal against punishment like suspension and withholding of salary before the Standing Committee.
Accordingly, the Commissioner, Thane Municipal Corporation, passed Standing Committee Resolution No. 1789, dated 31.03.2016 has been sent to the Government for dissolution under Section 451 of the Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act.
