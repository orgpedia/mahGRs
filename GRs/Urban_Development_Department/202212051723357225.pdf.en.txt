In order to provide an opportunity to the sanitation workers, who are referred to as hereditary business employees, to buy the houses they are currently living in, the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation has issued Municipal Resolution No. The policy has been fixed under Section 238. Mr. Tanaji Dashrath Padalkar was working in the post of" Health Inspector" officer.
Because of this, their cleaning workers are not included in this category.
02. Contrary to the policy of the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation to sell the houses currently occupied by the sweepers, who are called hereditary workers, through the purchase method, the Mahasabha has decided to give the house of Tanaji Dashrath Padalkar (now retired), an employee of the post of" Health Inspector" in addition to the sweeper, to the residents of room No. Decision No. 1. 17, dated 19/06/2018, as it appears to be inconsistent with the Municipal Corporation Policy, the matter was under consideration of the Government to dissolve the said resolution as per the provisions of Section 451 of the Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act.
Government's decision:
Kolhapur Municipal Corporation Resolution passed on 19/06/2018 No. 17, as it is against the existing policy of the Municipal Corporation, it is being suspended in the first place under the provisions of Section 451 (1) of the Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act, 1949.
