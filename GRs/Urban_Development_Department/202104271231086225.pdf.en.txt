Ministry, Mumbai- 400 032.
Date:- 27/04/2021
Reference:- 1) Resolution No. 108 passed by Solapur Municipal Corporation dated 20.01.2021.
2) Letter from the Commissioner, Solapur Municipal Corporation No. SAS/ Cell-1/ Aastha- 2/1758, Dy. 10.03.2021
The Proposal:
In order to reduce the expenditure on medical reimbursement bills of the employees of Solapur Municipal Corporation, the Municipal Corporation intends to make a Mediclaim Policy and in the financial interest of the Municipal Corporation, the rates were sought from the insurance representatives by issuing an advertisement on 07.12.2020 to insure the employees as well as office bearers, corporators, employees on honorarium, employees on establishment, daily wage workers, transfer employees. A proposal was submitted to the General Assembly on 20.01.2021 in accordance with Section 35 of the Municipal Corporation Act to award the work order to the tenderer determined 81 out of the received rate. The list includes members of the transport and journalists on the beat, in addition to the list presented by the administration, whose medical insurance is to be taken off without passing a resolution as proposed by the administration in the General Assembly passing resolution No. 108. However, the journalists on the beat are not affiliated with the municipal corporation. Also, the transport activities are independent and if the members of the transport committee are insured, the demand for insuring the employees of the transport department can also come up. Considering these aspects, the government is of the view that the inclusion of these two is against the financial interest of the Municipal Corporation as per Section 451 of the Act.
As a result of Municipal Resolution No. The proposal to partially suspend the resolution to exclude the issue of" Transport members and journalists on the beat to be included in taking a mediclaim policy" in 108 was under the consideration of the government. Accordingly, the government has taken the following decisions:
" Mediclaim Policy of Transport Member and Journalist on Bit" in Resolution No. 108 passed in the General Meeting of Solapur Municipal Corporation dated 20.01.2021
