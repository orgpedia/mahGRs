The Proposal: -
There are 424 urban local bodies in the state, accounting for about 48 of the state's total population.
Percentage of the population is in urban areas. While the demand for water supply is rapidly increasing in this urban area,
The wastewater generated from cities is treated in small quantities for various purposes.
It is currently being recycled. Sustainable management of wastewater and recycling of treated water
This is an effective way to reduce stress on water resources. Therefore, the present and the future
Water security can be ensured for generations. Safe recycling of treated wastewater,
Promoted and processed in accordance with policy at the national and state levels
Institutionalized from wastewater, water and environmental security, considering socio-economic benefits
On construction, fixing responsibility of various systems and recycling of treated water.

Considering the large volume of sewage and sewage generated in AMRUT cities.
It is processed and widely recycled for industrial and commercial purposes.
It is possible to do. Hence, waste water and sewage from AMRUT cities should be treated and treated.
For recycling projects in industrial and commercial establishments near cities.
Policy funding is being proposed. Also, in the rest of the cities, two-tier
secondary treatment for various civic purposes (construction, road washing,
Garages, gardens, etc.) have scope for recycling and the remaining treated eco-friendly water is treated in the river.
It is common to leave it safely in drains and use it for agriculture and allied purposes.
4. To provide fit for purpose water for recycling purposes:
Various wastewater treatment technologies are currently available and central pollution control
After secondary treatment as per the standards of the Board (CPCB) (PH 6. 5 to
8.5, BOD < 30 mg / L, COD < 250 mg / L, TSS < 100 mg / L) water in river-drainage
There are safe release criteria. Hence, creation in every urban local body.
Secondary treatment of wastewater is in order.
Funding is being made available through other schemes. But the city which has a three-tier sewerage system

treatment) by using the water required for civic purposes other than for potable use.
The remaining water will be safely released into the river channel.
5. Prioritization of Recycling Projects:
It is possible to recycle treated water from the city's sewage for a variety of purposes.
But the treated water should be able to be treated in a cost-effective manner.
The priority of recycling is as follows:
A. Automatic power stations:
Automatic power stations use a large amount of water. Processed
The wastewater is mainly used for cooling, boiler feedwater and ash.
Can be used for management. Accordingly, the Centre through the "Tariff Policy" of 2016
The government processes from urban local bodies within 50 km of the power station.

It has been made mandatory to use the sewage water. This results in the use of fresh water.
Great savings can be made, as well as reduced environmental impacts.
Industries, trades and industrial estates:
The state is heavily industrialized, with textile industries, iron and steel
Processed wastewater can be used in factories and other industries. This leads to sewage.
Recycling will reduce the environmental impact and reduce the freshwater stress of these industries.
It can be done. The various industrial estates in the state are managed by the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation.
A water supply system has been set up by the corporation for these settlements.
It is.
If these settlements are to be supplied with treated water, fresh water is to be carried for this purpose.
A system has to be put in place. However, the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation
Not all industries in the colony will be able to use this treated water, however.
Some industries in the colony will be able to use this water. Hence, the industrial development of Maharashtra.
The Corporation undertakes industrial colony-wise recycling of treated water of the industries there.
Adequate wastewater is generated from the nearest urban local bodies by checking the requirements.
If so, water can be provided by processing it as needed.
Similarly, the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation will henceforth set up a new industrial colony.

can be used effectively. This is due to the sweets that are currently being used for this purpose.
The use of water can be avoided.
D. Municipal use:
For construction in cities, washing of roads, watering of parks, toilets in urban complexes.
Processed wastewater for flushing, public toilets, and firefighting systems.
It will be possible to recycle. This will avoid the use of fresh water for these purposes.

C. Agriculture:
Similarly, if a bulk buyer is not available for sewage in the city.
This secondary treated wastewater is civilian except for potable use.
It will be used for purposes and agriculture if the remaining water is safely released into the river channel.
It will be useful for irrigation purposes.
