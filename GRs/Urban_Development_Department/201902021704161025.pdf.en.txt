INTRODUCTION: After the completion of the construction of the Indira Gandhi Hospital of the Ichalkaranji Municipal Council, the Directorate of Municipal Administration had sanctioned the posts for this hospital in 1994. At that time, appointments to the sanctioned posts in the establishment of the Municipal Council were being made by this Regional Selection Board. As the selection committee could not provide immediate posts for this hospital at that time, 69 employees were appointed for a period of 6 months in the hospital with a no-objection certificate from the selection committee.
These appointments were later extended by the municipal council for 6-6 months. Of the 69 employees, some of them have been regularised after they cleared the competitive examination conducted by the selection committee. However, 54 employees did not appear or failed in the subsequent competitive examinations of the Selection Boards.
The proposal to retain the 54 temporary employees from the date of their appointment was earlier sent by the Municipal Council to the Directorate of Municipal Administration and Government, which was rejected in 2009.
As per the decision taken in the Cabinet meeting dated 21.06.2016, the said hospital of the Municipal Council has been transferred to the Public Health Department of the Government. In this context. As per the provision of Para 3 of the Government Resolution issued on 30.06.2016, 11 employees were given the option to stay in the Municipal Council. 113 employees in the public health department

agreed to join. Out of 113 medical staff, 70 medical staff were absorbed in the Public Health Department. However, since the 43 employees were temporary, the municipal council had decided that their services would be absorbed by the public health department if regularised by the competent authority.
In view of this decision, the proposal sent by the Director, Directorate of Municipal Administration, to regularize the services of a total of 54 temporary employees, including 43 temporary employees who have agreed to join the Public Health Department and 11 temporary employees who have given the option to stay in the Municipal Council, was under the consideration of the government as a special and exceptional case. In this regard, the government has taken the following decision: Government Decision- Since the appointments of 54 employees in the attached list on the establishment of Ichalkaranji Municipal Council are not through this selection board, i.e. not in the prescribed way, it is not advisable to regularize the service. However, after the transfer of the hospital from the municipal council, the municipal council has no work to offer to the 43 employees who work as medical staff. In such a situation, the municipal council has to bear the burden of their salaries. Considering the fact that the Public Health Department is ready to accommodate them if their services are regularized, the government has decided to regularize the services of these 54 employees by accepting the recommendation of the Director, Directorate of Municipal Administration to regularize their services as a special and exceptional case. The Government is pleased to approve the continuation of the services of 54 (Medical and Non-Medical) employees of the attached list appointed from 1996 to 1999 on the establishment of Sabbath Ichalkaranji Municipal Council as a special and exceptional case under the following terms and conditions.
a) The services of the said employees are being made permanent/ regular from the date of this Government decision.
The previous service of such employees should be considered only for the purpose of retirement.
(c) The employees, whose services have been regularized as a special case, will not get any increment or any other financial benefit in respect of their earlier services. The Commissioner and Director, Directorate of Municipal Administration, Mumbai should take the guarantee of the concerned employees in this regard. Only after the receipt of this undertaking, the Directorate shall issue orders for the retention of these 54 employees in service. The decision has to be taken within 15 working days.
d) Out of these 54 employees, 43 are related to medical/ medical allied services and since 1 of them has retired, the services of 42 employees should be transferred to the Public Health Department within 3 months from the date of issuance of the Government Order. The salaries and allowances of these 42 employees will be paid by the Municipal Council after a period of 3 months from the issuance of the Government Decision.
