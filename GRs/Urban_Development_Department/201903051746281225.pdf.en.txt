(ii) The concerned Urban Local Bodies shall store rainwater in the building owned by them.
3. Regular water audit to be carried out by the concerned Urban Local Bodies. In respect of rectification of defects mentioned in the Water Records Inspection Report, the concerned Urban Local Body shall be required to complete the defects within the prescribed time frame by formulating necessary action programmes in this regard.
(a) The method of distribution of funds:
1. Reference No. The first installment of funds for the project has already been disbursed to the Municipal Council after obtaining prior administrative approval.
After disbursing the first installment of funds to the projects approved under the Maharashtra Golden Jubilee Urban Mission, it will be mandatory to open a separate account in the banks prescribed by the government as per the prevailing policy of the government. Accordingly, the municipal council should ensure that the said funds are kept in a separate bank account. The entire responsibility of this will be of the Chief Minister and the Chief Secretary.
While setting up self-financing funds for projects sanctioned under the Maharashtra Suvarna Jayanti Nagrothan Abhiyan, urban local bodies will be required to converge with the 14th Finance Commission (Fundamental and Functional) grants received from the state government. For this, they will have to deposit their money.

Urban Local Bodies should submit a proposal to the Government through the Directorate of Municipal Administration to demand the second installment. The Directorate of Municipal Administration should scrutinize the proposals and submit them to the government with appropriate feedback.
After the State Government approves the share of the State Government to the concerned local body for the project approved under this mission, the local body concerned should provide the amount of self-assurance from the State Government's account at each stage of the expenditure. With this, there will be no time to pay the share of the local body in such a scheme at once.
The funds sanctioned by the State Government for the projects sanctioned under the Maharashtra Suvarna Jayanti Nagrothan Mahabhiyana can be used only for that project and cannot be diverted or used for any other work. Thus, the principal amount or the interest on it remains

Government Resolution No: Nagar- 2019/ No.83/ NV-33
Any diversion, whether in the form or temporary, will be considered as a serious financial irregularity for which action will be taken by the concerned local bodies/ authorities concerned.

Under this campaign, it will be mandatory to tender the approved project within 7 days of administrative approval and to give work orders within three months and to start the work directly before the 91st day.
The implementing agency shall be bound to follow the instructions contained in the Government Resolution No. 3 in the context of the tender process of the project.

5. It shall be binding on the concerned implementing agency to complete the project within the time frame prescribed for the project.

7. Procurement of any kind of pipes for the project which are not required at the beginning and providing for the same from the project fund will be considered as serious financial irregularities and the concerned executing agency and project management consultancy will be held responsible.
3rd stage technical evaluation of the projects:
Under the Maharashtra Suvarna Jayanti Nagarotna Maha Abhiyan, it will be mandatory for the concerned urban local body to conduct a" third party technical audit" of the approved projects at various stages of implementation by one of the mechanisms set up by the government from time to time. Also, while submitting the proposal for sanction of second installment under the project, it will be necessary to submit a certificate regarding the quality of the said" third technical examination." After that, the second installment will be released.
(f) To raise loan for financing the project.
Under the Maharashtra Suvarnajayanti Nagarotna Abhiyan, the concerned urban local bodies will be allowed to borrow from nationalised banks, HUDCO, Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), Maharashtra Urban Infrastructure Development Company Limited (MUIDCL) and government approved financial institutions to raise their own funds for the sanctioned projects.

Government Resolution No: Nagar- 2019/ No.83/ NV-33
(2) However, in case of borrowings from financial institutions, the permission of the Government shall be taken for borrowing subject to the prevailing rules after fulfilling the requisite requirements in this regard. Necessary action will be taken as per the government rules.
Maintenance and maintenance of the project:
Necessary planning for maintenance and repair of the projects sanctioned under the Maharashtra Suvarnajayanti Nagarothana Mahaabhiyan should be done by the concerned implementing agencies so that the results from these projects are sustainable.
The responsibility of maintenance and repair of this scheme shall be of the concerned urban local body. No funds will be received from the government for maintenance and repair of the scheme.
Other terms and conditions:

5.There will be no duplication of water supply works included in the project. This should be verified.
(6) The water reservation required for the project should be made available before the project is commissioned.
Out of the pending work of the underground sewerage scheme under UIDSSMT, the municipal council has partially completed the sewerage works without completing the work of the STP. As a result, the program is not working. Therefore, a detailed proposal should be submitted to the government immediately with the option of the balance in the UIDSSMT scheme and the measures to be taken in accordance with the results of the scheme.
(d) While approving the said project, the sub-segment of road reinstatement affected by the project has been omitted from the project report. As a result, the special road grant for the reconstruction of the roads affected by the project will be separately approved by the municipal council when the project work is completed.
