Government Decision Serial No. 25.2.2022 wbd. 7.12.2022
The Proposal: -
Cidco Corporation has been constituted as a "New City Development Authority" under Section 113 (3) (a) of the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966 for the development of notified lands in a total of 95 villages in Thane, Panvel B Uran taluks of Thane and Raigad districts for the Navi Mumbai project. Project victims have carried out unauthorised constructions, mainly in rural areas, even while land acquisition proposals for land notified for the Navi Mumbai project are pending as well as after the land acquisition. In the meantime, the project victims have built houses as per their need by encroaching on the surrounding villages due to their natural flood of kutumbis. It would not be advisable to take over the land by removing the encroachments made on the land by the project or non-project victims for their own residence / livelihood. Also, due to legal difficulties, court cases, demands from local public representatives, opposition from project victims, etc., Cidco Corporation has not been able to take possession of these lands. Hence, it is necessary to regularize the land under construction as required by the project victims as well as the non-project victims.
Regarding the regularization of land under construction made by project victims in Navi Mumbai for residential purposes as per requirement. 25.2.2022 b. The policy decision has been taken under the Government Decision on 7.12.2022. However, the difficulties faced by CIDCO Corporation in implementing the decision were not met by the local authorities. The Cidco Corporation was listed to submit a self-explanatory proposal after taking into account the representations / applications / suggestions submitted by the public representatives, project victims to the government and the issues raised at the government level meetings. In pursuance of this direction, the Cidco Corporation has submitted a memorandum to the Government. With regard to the regulation of land under construction, which was taken into account in the proposal dated 2.7.2024. 25.2.2022 and d. It was under the consideration of the government to take comprehensive policy decisions by streamlining the government decisions on 7.12.2022.
