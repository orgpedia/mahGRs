It is difficult to determine who are the owners and fixed occupants of the lands under the said project. There is a large number of unauthorised constructions.

Government Resolution No.: V.V.M-1918/ P.No.396/ NV-23
The government has issued land acquisition notices for the freight corridor, so the farmers will be landless.
The Vasai-Virar sub-region needs a metro rail project. But the government is ignoring this demand.
The Vasai-Virar Municipal Corporation is the planning authority of the city and the decision will be challenged. The fundamental rights of the local bodies will also be affected.
The Commissioner, Vasai-Virar City Municipal Corporation has issued reference No. 4 As per the letter, the following comments have been given: As per Section 37 (1A) of the Maharashtra Regional Planning and Town Planning Act, 1966, the Vasai-Virar City Municipal Corporation has submitted a proposal to the Government and accordingly the Government should approve the said proposal.
The resolution of the Vasai-Virar City Municipal Corporation will hamper the implementation of the bullet train project and limit the proper compensation to the project victims.
As this resolution is against the larger public interest, further action should be taken under Section 451 of the Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act.
The following points need to be considered in this regard: The Mumbai-Ahmedabad High Speed Rail (Bullet Train) is an ambitious project of the Central Government.
National High Speed Rail Corporation Ltd. It is a joint venture between the Government of India and the respective state governments.
The Mumbai-Ahmedabad high-speed rail (bullet train) affected area of 14 revenue villages in the Vasai-Virar city municipal corporation area is about 30.459 hectares and the length is 17.405 km. The affected area of 2 revenue villages in Vasai-Virar sub-region is about 7.29 hectares and is 4.167 km long. A high-speed rail (bullet train) station is also proposed on the border of Mauje Virar and Moreh villages.
National High Speed Rail Corporation Limited vide letter dated 25.09.2018 has issued TDR to the owners of the land affected by the Mumbai Ahmedabad High Speed Rail Project.
A request has been made to the municipal corporation.
There is a provision for grant of TDR on the roads and reservations included in the approved development plan as per Government decision dated 29.01.2016.
Vasai-Virar City Municipal Corporation has been declared as Planning Authority for its area vide notification dated 07.07.2010 and Special Planning Authority for Vasai Virar Sub-Region vide Notification dated 21.02.2015.
If TDR is to be made available to project victims, the affected area must be included in the approved development plan.

Government Resolution No.: V.V.M-1918/ P.No.396/ NV-23
37 (1) of the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966 was introduced in the General Assembly on 19.12.2018. However, the General Assembly rejected the Administration's proposal on the following grounds: 1. The areas covered by the project are agricultural and horticultural areas, which are the only means of livelihood for local citizens and poor Adivasis, and will lead to starvation of farmers. This is an injustice to the local people and they will suffer huge financial losses and the farmers will become landless.
No detailed or detailed information of this project is available in the Municipal Corporation's Goshwara.
3. Since the project is not owned by the Municipal Corporation, the question of grant of TDR does not arise.
There is a lot of resentment against the project at the local level.
People are not getting the benefit of the project. The ticket prices of these high-speed trains will be beyond the reach of common people.
6. The buffer zone shown on both sides of the reservation does not result in any use of the land or payment of any compensation by the Government.
Priority should be given to take urgent measures to improve the quality and standard of the Western Railway, including the existing local services, rather than implementing the Mumbai-Ahmedabad high-speed rail project. Also, the frequency of suburban local services should be increased so that the passengers here can travel smoothly and comfortably.
8. For the earlier Vadodara Expressway, reservation was made on the land of the locals here. However, the government seems to have changed its mind. However, the records of the other rights of the seven baras remain the same and the project victims have not received any compensation or the land has not been released from the reservation.
As per Section 37 (1) of the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966, most of the proposals submitted earlier for the approval of the government are pending at the government level.
However, the general body meeting of Vasai Virar City Municipal Corporation passed Resolution No. 15, dated 13.02.2019 was suspended under the provision of Section 451 (1) of the Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act as it was found to be against the larger public interest and a representation was sought from the concerned under the provision of Section 451 (2) within one month.

Government Resolution No.: V.V.M-1918/ P.No.396/ NV-23
Accordingly, the Mayor, Vasai-Virar City Municipal Corporation vide letter dated 14.02.2019 passed the resolution of the General Body of the Vasai-Virar City Municipal Corporation vide No. 15, dated 13.02.2019 have been submitted.
The issues raised by the Vasai-Virar City Municipal Corporation have pointed out that it is difficult to determine who are the owners or occupiers of the lands under the project.
The matter should be examined by the concerned authority at the time of land acquisition and instructions should be given to the concerned authorities of land acquisition to take necessary action.
The action is being taken at the government level as per the proposal of the Commissioner, Vasai-Virar City Municipal Corporation, under the authority conferred under Section 37 (1A) of the Maharashtra Regional Planning and Town Planning Act, 1966. It would not be appropriate to say that this will hamper the fundamental rights of the urban local bodies.
The Vasai-Virar Municipal Corporation has rejected the proposal of the Mumbai-Ahmedabad high-speed railway project, which is an ambitious project of the central government.
High-speed rail will create a faster means of transportation. It will also create a large number of jobs and for this, a high-speed railway (bullet train) station is proposed in the Vasai-Virar sub-region.
The construction of the high-speed rail project is expected to bring a huge economic boost to the Vasai-Virar sub-region.
If the land owner provides land for the project, then the land owners will be able to save on the cost of the project by providing TDR to the land owners and this will also help the land owners to get proper compensation for their land.
Therefore, the above resolution will limit the inclusion of drawings as per Section 37 (1) of the Maharashtra Regional Planning and Town Planning Act, 1966 in the approved development plan of the Vasai-Virar City Municipal Corporation and appropriate compensation to the land owners who will be affected by the project.
