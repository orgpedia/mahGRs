GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: MUP-2020/ P.S. 142/ NV-19
Ministry, Mumbai- 400 032.
Date: December 5, 2022
Read: Letter from the Commissioner, Kolhapur Municipal Corporation No. 604/ KMT/ 20, D. 06/03/2020.
Introduction: Mr. Ranvir Kamble, was working under the Transport Undertaking of Kolhapur Municipal Corporation in the post of Substitute Conductor. Mr. Kamble was on scheduled duty on 30/12/2018 at 43A. On checking the ticket tray, cash bag, passenger tickets in the bus, etc., it was found that Mr. Kamble had in his possession an amount of Rs. 131/- was found to be unaccounted for. Also, he was fined Rs. 300/- was found to be unaccounted for.
The preliminary explanation submitted by Mr. Kamble regarding the aforesaid illegalities was not reasonable and correct. Considering the disproportionate increase in the financial accounts as mentioned above by Mr. Kamble and the disproportionate amount of money found in the embezzlement, Mr. Kamble has clearly lost the credibility to be entrusted with the post of Conductor.
Therefore, in order to create awareness among other employees of the transport undertaking about the honest functioning of the transport undertaking, action was taken to dismiss Mr. Kamble from service and permanently reduce his name from the transfer carrier waiting list.
Thereafter, as a one-time opportunity, Mr. Ranvir Bhagwan Kamble should be accommodated on the replacement carrier waiting list. 29, dated 20/12/2019. However, the allegation of misappropriation of ticket sale money by Mr. Kamble and his dishonesty is extremely serious. Therefore, re-induction of a serious employee like Mr. Kamble in the service of the transport undertaking will be dangerous for the public sector undertaking and will harm the interest and reputation of the transport undertaking.
Therefore, Municipal Council Resolution No. 29, dated 20/12/2019 has been requested by the Commissioner, Kolhapur Municipal Corporation to disconnect it.
