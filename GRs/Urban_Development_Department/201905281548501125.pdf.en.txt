Ministry of Health, Mumbai
Date of Birth: May 28, 2019
Read- Government Resolution No. 2016/ No. 28/ NV-33, D. 14.02.2017 Preamble The modalities for implementation of water supply projects in urban areas have been prescribed under the relevant Government decisions. Accordingly, instructions have been issued to assess the water table after taking into account the maintenance and repair cost of the water supply projects sanctioned under various schemes.
While approving the water supply scheme, in order to ensure the sustainability of the scheme in line with the maintenance, while approving the DPR, it is decided by the concerned urban local self-government institution to recover the water table at the rate proposed in the DPR. However, after the approval of the actual scheme, there was a discussion during the testimony of the Public Accounts Committee that the water table was not being charged regularly as per the rates proposed in the DPR and as decided by the concerned urban local body.
Therefore, the Public Accounts Committee had recommended that the government should instruct all the concerned urban local bodies to collect water as per the resolution approved before the approval of the water supply scheme. A proposal had been sent to the Government in this regard.
Government Decisions It is imperative to ensure that the cost of maintenance and repair of the water supply scheme is met by the urban local self-government institutions to ensure the sustainable implementation and maintenance of the water supply system. For that, it is essential to make the charging and recovery of the water table effective. The instructions for this have been issued.
(1) While preparing the Detailed Project Report (DPR) of water supply projects through Urban Local Bodies, the reasonable rate of water table should be proposed in the DPR after examining the financial aspects required for reimbursement of expenditure incurred for maintenance of the scheme.

2. The DPR is required to be submitted to the Government with the approval of the concerned Urban Local Body before it is submitted to the Government Scheme. Accordingly, while taking a decision on the approval of the scheme, the urban local body necessary for the scheme should include in the resolution of the urban local body the setting up of the stake, the implementation of the reforms, as well as the decision to charge and recover the water table according to the water table rate proposed in the DPR.
After the proposal is submitted by the urban local body for approval under various schemes of the government or from the funds of the concerned urban local body and after the approval of the competent authority for the said scheme, it will be mandatory for the concerned urban local self-government institution to charge and collect the water tariff as per the resolution made in this regard by the concerned urban local body. It will also be mandatory to take positive measures to reduce the amount of water wasted.
4. The Commissioner, Municipal Corporation/ Principal, Municipal Council/ Nagar Panchayat concerned shall be solely responsible for the assessment and recovery of water charges as per the rates fixed by the respective Urban Local Bodies before sanctioning the water supply scheme.
As per Section 77 (a) of the Maharashtra Municipal Councils, Nagar Panchayats and Industrial Towns Act, 1965, the responsibility of implementing this policy of the state government will be on the concerned headman, Nagar Parishad/ Nagar Panchayat.
