After considering the points raised, the points in the written statement and the relevant documents, the government has taken the following decisions:
Government Decision: Mehkar Municipal Council has decided to take up the reservation in front of weekly market No. Post-facto approval of the Government is being given to the developer for the development of Shopping Center and Vegetable Market on B.O.T. basis subject to the following conditions: 1. The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed on 28.09.2012 is being cancelled and the Municipal Council and the Developer are being allowed to enter into a fresh Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Developer.
2) The District Collector has filed a case No. MMA- 1965/308/ Mehkar/ 53/2014. Upholding the resolution of the Municipal Council regarding the B.O.T. under the order dated 11.04.2016, it was stated that the Municipal Council has suffered financial loss in this case. He also directed to conduct an audit of local funds. Accordingly, the Local Fund Audit has found that the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was not executed by providing appropriate stamp duty and the premium amount was charged at the 2012-13 rate instead of the 2013-14 rate. Therefore, the price of the site should be calculated at the rate of 2013-14 taking into account the 1.5 Floor Area Index (FSI). The developer had earlier invested Rs. 51,00,000/- has been provided. The premium is calculated using 1 floor area index (FSI). It has a Floor Area Index (FSI) of 1.5. Therefore, considering the actual floor area index (FSI) used, the amount of premium at the rate of 2013-14 should be calculated and the difference should be deposited by the developer with the Municipal Council before signing the agreement.
(3) While allotting 74 plots, the developer shall intimate in writing to the Municipal Council the amount received as premium from the concerned plot holders. These premium amounts are non-refundable, which the developer must certify in writing and mention in the written agreement to be made with the concerned.
4) The developer should be given a time frame to complete the remaining portions. This will be decided by the city council.
5) Rent of all the plots- The three-member committee, the directorate of the municipal council. be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Standing Directive of 28.10.2004 (taking into account the ready reckoner rate in the year when the allocation was made). While deciding this, the committee should take into account the report of the Commissioner, Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation. Also, the rent of the slums should be increased as per the standing order of the Directorate of Municipal Council.
In the case of 74 pits constructed earlier, the rent at the above revised rate will be calculated and paid from the next day on completion of 1 year from the date of allotment.

Amended agreements should be made by incorporating the terms and conditions mentioned in paragraph 3 of the Standing Directive of 28.10.2004.
