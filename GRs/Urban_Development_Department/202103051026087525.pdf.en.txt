The Proposal:
The 1.62-hectare R site is reserved for Reservation No. 9 Mini Stadium-cum-Sport Complex owned by the Savner Municipal Council in Nagpur district. Of this area, 15900 sq.
That is, the 1.59-hectare R site has already been transferred to the Taluk Sports Officer by the Municipal Council in 2003 free of cost. The agreement was signed on February 20, 2004. The Taluk Sports Officer has demanded from the Saoner Municipal Council that the remaining space (300 sq.m.) should be constructed on this site to provide necessary facilities to the sports complex and to provide future funds. The Savner Municipal Council is ready to give the site to the sports complex. However, the Municipal Council has passed a majority resolution dated 20/2/2020 to allocate 60% to the Municipal Council and 40% to the Sports Complex for the maintenance and repair of the sports complex by the Sports Officer on the said site. However, the Sports Department is ready to give 40 per cent of the amount to the Municipal Council. The Galle Sports Department will be constructed on the site and 40 percent of the galle will be transferred to the municipal council after construction. It cannot be said that the municipal council suffers financial loss as it will get free construction of drains. Considering the reservation of this place, the Sports Department will prepare an international standard 400-meter running track there and considering the public purpose and the larger public interest, it is necessary to transfer the place to the Sports Department. This project is of the state government. In view of the above and in view of the views of the School Education and Sports Department of the Government in this regard, the Government under Section 312A of the Maharashtra Municipal Councils, Nagar Panchayats and Industrial Towns Act, 1965, hereby directs that the School Education and Sports Department, Government of Maharashtra, shall take necessary steps to ensure that all the schools, colleges, educational institutions, etc.
