the order
Due to the unseasonal rains and floods in the state, the farmers have not been able to repay the loans taken from the banks. As a result, farmers were unable to get loans for their crops and were facing difficulties in repaying loans. In this background, the State Government, vide Government Resolution dated 27.12.2019, has decided to declare" Mahatma Jotirao Phule Farmers Debt Waiver Scheme 2019" and extend the benefit of loan waiver to such loan accounts where the outstanding and unpaid amount in the crop loan/ restructured/ re-structured loan account with principal and interest as on 30.09.2019 is up to Rs. 2.00 lakh; thereby, uploading the information on the portal for immediate implementation of the loan waiver scheme, providing the list of farmers to banks, publicizing the list of farmers, Aadhaar authentication of loan account holders, grievance redressal through district level committees etc. The objective of the scheme is to provide debt relief to the farmers and make them eligible for loans for the next kharif season. Therefore, since the process of loan waiver of farmers has to be completed before the next season, the active participation of the district level field officers of the cooperative department as well as the district collector and their field officers is expected and considering the priority of this loan waiver work, most of the officers of the cooperative department are busy in the implementation of the scheme; therefore, considering the total number of 22,680 cooperative societies in the A, B, C and D categories eligible for elections in the state, a large number of trained manpower is required to conduct their elections. However, the field officers of the concerned departments will remain busy in the implementation of the Mahatma Jotirao Phule Farmers Debt Waiver Scheme 2019. Therefore, elections to the managing committees of the cooperative societies are not possible due to lack of manpower; therefore, the elections to the housing cooperative societies, which have a strength of up to 250 members or less, are not possible. Postponed to 29/02/2020. Elections were also held to the District Cooperative Central Banks and Primary Agricultural Cooperative Societies. Order dated 27/01/2020 is hereby postponed for a further period of three months.
