Regarding the approval of the new accounting head for both the purposes of loans received from the National Cooperative Development Corporation for the Maran Division and the interest on loans.
The Government of Maharashtra
Department of Co-operation, Marketing and Textiles
GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: SAKIRN-2019/ (P.S. 70/2019)/ 9-C
Hutatma Rajguru Chowk, Madam Cama Road
Mantralaya Extension, Mumbai- 400 032
Date: 19th of October 2019
Preamble: Annual instalment of loan and interest on loan to be paid to National Cooperative Development Corporation for all the three wards of Cooperative Marketing and Textile Department Loans received from National Cooperative Development Corporation (6003 0242)-56 Repayment of loan and National Cooperative Development
The interest on the loan from the corporation (2049 1043)-45 interest was being done from this single scheme. It will be more convenient for the Department to have separate head of accounts for the purpose of both loans from the National Cooperative Development Corporation and interest on loans from the National Cooperative Development Corporation. So that the information regarding the actual collection is also submitted by that ward to the finance department, it will be easier to distribute the funds and the ward-wise provisions under the separate account head will be budgeted in the same proportion and also the provision that is returned every year will be adjusted after the accurate estimates are submitted as there is a separate account head for the ward. For this, the government was considering to take a new chapter-wise account title for the year 2020-21.
Government Decision: The following new head of accounts are being approved for the Panan Division for both the purpose of loans and interest on loans received from the National Cooperative Development Corporation.
