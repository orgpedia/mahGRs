In order to ensure remunerative prices for the agricultural products produced and to generate additional employment, it has been decided to provide financial assistance to the Agricultural Processing Cooperatives under the National Cooperative Development Corporation Scheme and from the State Government, taking into account the regional cropping pattern and the geographical location of the State. The government has taken 1 decision. The reference No. Under the decision of the government here, the agricultural processing companies are provided financial assistance in the ratio of 60:36:4 as per the detailed inspection and recommendation of the marketing director. Under this scheme, financial assistance has been distributed to 116 institutions in the state. Out of these, 10 Agro Processing Agencies have fully repaid the financial assistance. The remaining 106 are from agricultural processing units. As on 30.06.2019, a total of Rs. 43068.51 lakhs out of which Rs. 1910.44 lakh has been recovered. The recovery rate is only 4.43 per cent.
Even after providing full financial assistance to the agricultural processing cooperatives under the NSS scheme, the organization is not seen regularly repaying the financial assistance given to them by producing the project on time. So, the purpose for which the funding is given, that purpose is not fulfilled. Also, the government funds are not being utilised properly due to non-payment of loans. Since the S.V.N.S. is done regularly by the government, it is unnecessarily imposed on the government. Such a huge amount of funding does not seem to have resulted in job creation. As a result, about Rs. 411.58 crore. As a result, the government is losing crores of rupees. The Accountant General's Office has also raised objections from time to time due to low recovery. Therefore, the matter of forming a vigilance and control team under the control of the Joint Secretary/ Deputy Secretary (Finance) was under the consideration of the government. Accordingly, the government has taken the following steps:
