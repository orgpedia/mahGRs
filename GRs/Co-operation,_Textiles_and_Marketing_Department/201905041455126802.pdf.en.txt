Continuation of process post/ 653/2019, dated 22.04.2019.
Preamble: As per the decision of the Government in Reference-1, a total of 9,319 posts have been approved for the revised figure as per the review of permanent/ temporary posts in the Subordinate Regional Offices of the Department of Cooperation, Marketing and Textiles. Instructions were issued to the Commissioner of Cooperation and Registrar, Cooperative Societies, Maharashtra State, Pune to issue detailed orders for office-wise allocation of posts in this figure at Taluka/ District/ Division/ Headquarters level. Accordingly, orders for office-wise allotment of 32 posts at Taluka/ District/ Division/ Headquarters level for Agriculture Processing Cooperative Societies have been issued by the Commissioner of Cooperation and Registrar, Cooperative Societies, Maharashtra State, Pune.
32 temporary posts sanctioned for the audit of agricultural processing cooperatives. 01.10.2018 to D. For the period 28.02.2019 Read No. 3 herein approved vide Government Resolution dated 29.10.2018. A proposal for the continuation of these temporary posts for the year 2018-19 has been submitted to the Government by the Commissioner of Cooperation and Registrar, Cooperative Societies, Maharashtra State, Pune, vide letter at Reference 5 above. After reviewing these posts, it was observed that in the districts where a large amount of financial assistance has been distributed to the agricultural processing cooperatives,

GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: ASTHAMU-2019/ PR No. 40/1-S
The posts have not been allotted. A review of the recovery of financial assistance disbursed to the Agricultural Processing Cooperatives so far shows that there has been a meagre recovery. It is observed that these posts created for the audit of agricultural processing cooperatives do not carry out the functions of agricultural processing cooperatives. While allocating the financial assistance to the Agricultural Processing Cooperatives as per the pattern approved by the National Cooperative Development Corporation, the proposal would have been submitted for approval of the Planning and Finance Department to recover the amount of financial assistance from the institutions which have already been given financial assistance and whose institutions have been closed or have become defunct. Also, the Finance and Planning Department has been instructed to submit a report on what is the mechanism for this recovery. Since the loans are not being recovered from the institutions given earlier, this debt is an additional burden on the government. In view of this and as it is observed that the posts created for the audit of the Agricultural Processing Cooperatives have not been allocated properly as per the approved figure of permanent/ temporary posts in the field office, the 32 posts sanctioned for the audit of Agricultural Processing Cooperatives have been allocated for the recovery of the financial assistance given to the Agricultural Processing Cooperatives and for the proper examination of the proposals submitted to the Government. As per the revised office-wise allocation at Taluk/ District/ Division/ Headquarter level as per the Government decision dated 15.04.2019, the total number of vacant posts in Taluk/ District/ Division/ Headquarter level is Rs. 01.03.2019 to D. Orders have been issued to extend the period up to 30.09.2019. However, reference No. 7 In pursuance of the request made under the letter herein, the matter of extending the revised deadline was under consideration of the Government.
Government's decision:
The government has issued orders towards this.
Since the officers/ staff have been given posting as per the earlier order of allotment of sanctioned posts for audit of Agricultural Processing Co-operative Societies and have been enrolled in the system of service accordingly, the salary of the said posts has been increased from Rs. The office of the Cooperation Commissioner and Registrar, Cooperative Societies, M.R. Pune has requested to grant extension as per the earlier allotment of the said posts as it could not be done as per the revised allotment under the Government decision dated 15.04.2019. Reference No. 22.04.2019. 7 is written here. It is likely to take some time to issue orders as per the revised allocation of the posts and to post the officers/ staff accordingly. Keeping this in view and in order to clear the salary dues of the employees at present, 32 posts created for the audit of Agricultural Processing Cooperatives as per the earlier allocation have been given. 01.03.2019 to D. The extension is being granted as shown in the table below till 31.05.2019.
