GOVERNMENT ORDER, NO.: SAPAS-2019/ PR No. 136/24 C
Mantralaya Extension, Mumbai- 400 032
The date: September 3, 2019.
Reference:- (1) Minutes of the meeting of the Council of Ministers dated 24th August, 2019.
(2) The decision was taken at a meeting held under the chairmanship of the Chief Secretary, Maharashtra.
Government Order: Under the Minimum Support Price (MSP) scheme in the state, the procurement of pulses and oilseeds is done by NAFED through the State Nodal Agency. State Nodal Agencies and Sub-Agent Institutions are allowed to bear the cost of collateral for procurement at guaranteed price.
(2) A committee under the chairmanship of the District Deputy Commissioner of the concerned district, Cooperative Societies, has been constituted to fix the rates of pawn, tola and other incidental expenses in all the Agricultural Produce Market Committees of the State. The prices are determined by taking into account the geographical situation of the district and the Agricultural Produce Market Committee, the cropping pattern, the arrival and sale of agricultural products in the Agricultural Produce Market Committee, etc. Therefore, the rates of porters, tillers and other things in every agricultural produce market committee are different.
3 Since the rates of Hamali, Tolai and other collateral costs are different in each district's Agricultural Produce Market Committees, the State Nodal Agencies face difficulties in preparing the collateral cost proposals, resulting in late submission of collateral cost proposals to NAFED. As a result, the sub-agent entities receive the amount of collateral late and they face many difficulties in procuring the collateral. Due to this, there is dissatisfaction among all the sub-agents.
In view of the above, a Committee under the Chairmanship of Principal Secretary (Textiles) may be constituted to fix the rates of the collateral cost for procurement under the Guarantee Scheme by NAFED for Kharif Season 2019 and Rabi Season 2020 as under:- Managing Director, Maharashtra State Co-operative Marketing Federation, Mumbai- Member
