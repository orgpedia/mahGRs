As per the approval of the Cabinet in its meeting held on 24.6.2017, Govt. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Shetkari Samman Yojana 2017 has been announced on 28.6.2017. It has also been amended from time to time under the relevant Government Decisions/ Government Corrigendum. Under this scheme, a green list is issued from time to time on the basis of which eligible beneficiaries are identified and the benefit of the scheme is given to the beneficiaries on loan/ savings account. However, many of the loan accounts could not be processed due to insufficient information, incorrect information, wrong flagging, etc.
Many farmers have complained to the government and various offices of the cooperative department about not getting the benefit of this scheme updated. They also complained that the banks were not providing fresh loans to the farmers who had availed themselves of the scheme.
