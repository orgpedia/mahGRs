Under this scheme, short-term, medium-term and long-term loans are provided to the farmers.

There are many difficulties to overcome. Therefore, the Cooperation Commissioner has requested to increase the financial assistance given under the government decision in Reference No. 2.
Considering the importance of Primary Agricultural Cooperative Credit Societies for providing crop loans to the farmers of the State, the Government was considering to increase the financial assistance under the Scheme for Empowerment of Primary Agricultural Credit Cooperative Societies (STCCS) as per the Government Decision dated 17/05/2006.
Government's decision
Primary Agricultural Credit in the State To compensate the losses of the Cooperative Societies, they should be given the amount of crop loan disbursement made by these societies in each financial year as per Reference No. The financial assistance provided as per the Government Decision No. 2 is being revised as follows:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| 1) | Crop loans up to Rs 25 lakh                       |   | 2% instead of 1.5%     |
| 2) | Crop loans from Rs. 25 lakh to Rs. 50 lakh        |   | 1.50% instead of 1.00% |
| 3) | Crop loans from Rs 50 lakh to Rs 1 crore          |   | 1% instead of 0.75%    |
| 4) | Institutions allotted crop loans above Rs 1 crore |   | 0.75% instead of 0.50% |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
However, as mentioned above, the maximum limit of financial assistance to Primary Agriculture Credit Co-operative Societies is Rs. 1 lakh to Rs. 1.50 lakh per institution.
