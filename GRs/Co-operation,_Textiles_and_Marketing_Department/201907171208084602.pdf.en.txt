Preamble: For effective recovery of unpaid loans of urban cooperative banks in the state, the Government has earlier approved the implementation of a one-time loan repayment scheme as recommended to the Government by the Cooperation Commissioner and Registrar, Cooperative Societies, Maharashtra State, Pune.
Periodic extension of the one-time loan repayment scheme has so far helped in reducing the mounting NPAs of urban cooperative banks. A proposal was under consideration of the government to extend the one-time loan repayment scheme for urban cooperative banks by including the defaulters in the scheme and closing the outstanding loan accounts to improve the balance sheet of the banks and for the effective implementation of the scheme.
Government's decision:
In exercise of the powers conferred by Section 157 of the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960, in pursuance of the guidelines of the Reserve Bank of India, the Government have decided to extend the one-time loan repayment scheme sanctioned to the Urban Cooperative Banks vide Government Resolution No. 15.11.2017 and Government Sanction Letter No. 26.02.2018, by exempting the provisions of Rule 49 of the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Rules, 1961, till 31.03.2020.
The scheme will be applicable to all loan accounts which are included in the category of doubtful or loss making loans as on 31.03.2018.
