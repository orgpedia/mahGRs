GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: ASTHAMU-2019/ PR No. 40/1-S
When taken, very little recovery is seen. It appears that the functioning of the Agricultural Processing Cooperatives is not being carried out through the said posts created for the audit of the Agricultural Processing Cooperatives. While allocating financial assistance to the Agro Processing Cooperative Societies as per the pattern approved by the National Cooperative Development Corporation, the proposal was submitted for approval of the Planning and Finance Department to recover the amount from the institutions which have been given financial assistance earlier and which have been closed or left in the lurch. Also, the Finance and Planning Department has been instructed to submit a report on what is the mechanism for this recovery. Also, the loans given earlier are not being recovered. However, the government pays the interest on this loan regularly every year. As a result, the government is burdened with additional debt. In view of this and the fact that the posts created for the audit of the Agricultural Processing Cooperatives have not been properly allocated as per the approved figure of permanent/ temporary posts in the field office, it is felt necessary to reconstitute the posts as indicated in the accompanying statement for proper examination of the proposals submitted to the Government and recovery of financial assistance given to the Agricultural Processing Cooperatives. Therefore, instructions are being given that orders regarding re-construction should be issued by the Commissioner of Cooperation and Registrar, Cooperative Societies, Maharashtra, Pune as indicated in the accompanying prospectus. 32 posts created for the audit of agricultural processing cooperatives. The matter of extension from 01.03.2019 was under consideration of the Government.
