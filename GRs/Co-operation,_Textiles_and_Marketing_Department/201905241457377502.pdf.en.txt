Introduction: The silk industry is an industry with huge employment potential based on agriculture and forest wealth.
The climate of the state is conducive for silk farming. The silk industry is proving to be a boon for the farmers of the state in order to avoid the damage caused by the vagaries of the environment and to get regular income. Silk farming and industries have the potential to provide sustainable income to the farmers. Several schemes are being implemented by the central and state governments for the development of the state. Through the Silk Maha Abhiyan, a massive campaign has been launched to contact as many farmers as possible in the state to register new beneficiaries who want to cultivate mulberry and want to start a tussar silk industry.
2. Expansion and development of sericulture Effective, post-harvesting process from mulberry cultivation to textile production Mulberry cultivation in group mode is essential for the integrated development of this industry. Under the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), the benefit is limited to one acre of mulberry cultivation per beneficiary in 120 clusters in 25 districts.
3. Spreading of high quality mulberry varieties, large scale production of disease free eggs of quality and high productivity double hybrid varieties, freezing and distribution of eggs as per requirement, propagation of latest technology for scientific pest management etc. At the same time, post-harvest processing is also important and the mulberry and tussar silk cells produced in the state must be processed in the state itself. It is also very important to complete the chain of quality weaving, silk sarees and fabrics, ready-made silk garments (Garment) by various processes like international standard silk yarn production, weaving, dyeing, warming, wafting on yarn. A large number of traditional artisans are engaged in the production of Paithani weaving on handloom in Yeola, Paithan, Nagpur, Aurangabad, Akola etc. while tussar sarees and textiles are being produced in Nagpur, Bhandara, Andalgaon etc. Paithani weavers source their raw material- silk yarn- from Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.
In the above background, the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Silk Samagra-ISDSI (Integrated Scheme for Development of Silk Industry) will be implemented in the State from 2018-19 to 2019-20.
