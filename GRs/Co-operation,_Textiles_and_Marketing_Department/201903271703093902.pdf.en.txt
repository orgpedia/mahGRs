The limit for the subsidy is 10 quintals per hectare and 2 hectares per farmer. To disburse this subsidy to the farmers, Rs 70 crore was initially made available to the Federation from the Contingency Fund. 480 crore is to be made available as loan from a nationalised bank through a government guarantee. The government has to pay the interest on the loan and the interest on it.
The circular dated 8/3/2019 of the Department of Finance has approved the disbursement of budgetary provisions (including supplementary demands) for the financial year 2018-2019. As the interest rate for the loan provided by the Pannon Federation from the bank to subsidize the tur and gram farmers is high, the government was considering providing a fund of Rs. 30.00 crore under the head" Financial Assistance for payment of the amount of collateral expenses incurred for the purchase of agricultural produce by the Maharashtra State Cooperative Pannon Federation" to reduce the financial burden on the government.
