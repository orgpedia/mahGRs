Letter from the Principal Secretary (Agriculture) No. Letter dated 31st January, 2018, No. 14/ R.C.O. Cell
The State Level Project Approval Committee (RKVY) has suggested that the departments whose projects are to be implemented under the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) should be provided only 60% of the Central share of funds through the Agriculture Department and 40% of the State share should be provided by the respective departments in their annual budget. The National Agriculture Development Scheme is a centrally sponsored scheme. The scheme is mainly aimed at strengthening the farmers and creating infrastructure in agriculture and allied sectors. Under the National Agriculture Development Scheme, the government was considering providing funds on the account of the state government to the funds received for various projects in the textile department.
Government's decision:
Under the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana, funds will be provided by the Central Government for various projects in the textile sector. Accordingly, an outlay of Rs. 4.00 crore has been earmarked under the Department of Textiles for the financial year 2018-19 for implementing maximum number of projects under Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana related to Textiles.
(2) The proposal for opening a new head of account for the budgetary provision as given in the administrative approval to the said scheme shall be sent to the Accountant General for approval with the approval of the Planning and Finance Department.
