Read: 1) Government Resolution, General Administration Department, No. SRV-2011/ PR No. 137/ Office- 12, D. 17/12/2016 2) Government Resolution, General Administration Department, No. SRV-2016/ PR No. 510/ Office- 12, D. 16/02/2018 3) Government Decision No. 3/3/2022
Introduction: In various government offices and corporations, only officers with knowledge of the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960 and the Maharashtra Agricultural Produce (Development and Regulation) Act, 1963 are required. Therefore, in the order of formation of the concerned office/ corporation/ in the rules of service entry/ in the government decision/ in the by-laws of some organizations, it has been provided to appoint only officers/ employees of the cooperative department on deputation to the concerned post in that office. These posts are to be filled by officers of the Cooperation, Marketing and Textile departments. The posts of deputation in the department are basically from the organizations related to the functioning of the department and under the jurisdiction of the department. These posts are to be filled from their original cadre. The government has already taken the decision in this regard. Also, the process of appointment, promotion and transfer is carried out in the same way as in regular posts.
Therefore, only officers/ employees of the Cooperation, Marketing and Textiles Department are appointed on deputation to such office/ corporation. In accordance with the policy of deputation issued in the government decision in the context of the General Administration Department. 5 (a) (6), if the services of officers/ employees of a particular cadre are required to be taken on deputation, if such posts are created on the establishment of another administrative department (in cases where the salary of the post is being paid from the Consolidated Fund of the State Government) or such posts are held by boards, corporations, companies, public undertakings and autonomous bodies under the control of the State Government.

GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: RAJAS-2022/ PR No. 19/5-C
The deputation policy will not be applicable to posts created in the establishment (whose salary is not paid from the Consolidated Fund of the State Government). As per the provisions of the Transfer Act, the process of appointment to such posts should be done by the concerned Cadre Control Department.
In accordance with the above policy of the General Administration Department, the Department of Cooperative Marketing and Textiles has included the posts in the regular posts in the promotion quota to which the officers of the Cooperative Department are appointed on deputation. As per the Government decision dated 3.3.2022, the strength of Additional Registrar, Joint Registrar, Sub-Registrar, Co-operative Societies, Group A and Assistant Registrar, Co-operative Societies Group and these 4 cadres has been fixed for the year 2022.
3. the structure of the department. Announced on 5/5/2011. Therefore, all the officers in the selection list were not included in the seniority list as the Department was of the view that the number of ad-hoc promoted officers who were promoted after 2011 should be shown in the seniority list only in proportion to the number of posts sanctioned in the format. The department has placed some officers in the seniority list by making reservations only in proportion to the sanctioned number of posts in the format. Hence, all officers in the select list who have been approved for promotion since 2011 are required to be placed in the seniority list. Hence the sequence. The Government Decision of 3/3/2022 needs to be overridden.
The Government was considering to fix the Cadre Strength of the posts in the Department of Cooperation, Marketing and Textiles by combining the sanctioned number of posts as per the format of the respective cadre and the year wise strength of the posts in the Government Offices/ Corporations in which only the posts of the Upper Registrar Cooperative Societies Group-A, Co-registrar Cooperative Societies Group-A, Sub-Registrar Cooperative Societies Group-A and Assistant Registrar Cooperative Societies Group-B in the Department of Cooperation, Marketing and Textiles are filled by deputation from these officers for the period 2011 to 2022.
GOVERNOR'S DECISION: 1. In view of the foregoing, the No. The Government Decision of 3/3/2022 is being superseded. The Government have decided to fix the cadre wise total strength of 4 cadres namely, Additional Registrar Cooperative Societies Group-A/ Co-registrar, Cooperative Societies Group-A/ Sub-Registrar, Cooperative Societies Group-A/ Assistant Registrar Cooperative Societies Group-B in the Department of Cooperation, Marketing and Textiles as under:
