The Proposal:
In the year 2017-18, due to favorable weather and satisfactory monsoon rains, the state had a bumper production of tur. 5 lakh under the Price Stabilisation Fund of the Central Government. Even after purchasing tonnes of tur, the farmers who had given tokens at the purchase centre had a large amount of tur left. Considering the low market price received by the farmers due to the abundant production of tur in the state, the government decided to purchase tur under the market intervention scheme to help the farmers. Panan Federation was appointed as the agent agency to implement the scheme. Since this is the first time such a scheme is being implemented in the state, there was no budgetary allocation for the expenditure incurred for this scheme. The Finance Department has sanctioned a total of Rs. 1493 crore.
Union Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, State Bank of India and Bank of Maharashtra contributed Rs. 1493.00 crore. From this fund, the Federation has paid the arrears and incidental expenses of tur procurement. The interest rate on the loan taken by the bank is 8.05 percent. The loan has to be repaid by the trade union through the sale of tur or toor dal. However, much of this process
