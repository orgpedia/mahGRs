the prelude
The Director (Silk) has submitted his comments vide letter dated 30/08/2019 on the proposal for setting up of a separate Silk Office of the Deputy Director in Aurangabad Division. The Directorate of Silk has submitted a proposal to create a total of 12 new gazetted/ non-gazetted posts to start a separate silk office in Aurangabad division. However, the matter of including the Directorate of Silk under the Textile Commissionerate in the State as announced under the Textile Policy is under separate consideration for preparing a consolidated framework for the same. At present, the total mulberry silk area in the state is 19783 acres.
Out of this, 11373 acres are in 8 districts of Aurangabad division. This area is more than half of the total mulberry silk area of the state. Accordingly, out of the total sanctioned posts under the Directorate of Sericulture, the allocation of posts in different departments in accordance with the following areas of sericulture should be proportionate. In this regard, it will be practical to carry out administrative work by relocating the silk workers in the areas of the state where the area under sericulture is less.
In view of the above facts and the response of the farmers to sericulture in all the districts of Aurangabad division and the various infrastructure facilities to be set up mainly for sericulture and industry in Aurangabad division, it was under the consideration of the government to strengthen the Regional Silk Office in Aurangabad and appoint a regional officer of the rank of Deputy Director in that division.
Government Decision: In the state of Maharashtra, most of the area under silk farming is in Aurangabad division.
The government has decided to open an office of the Deputy Director of Sericulture in Aurangabad division for sericulture and development of silk industry on its basis. Accordingly, the Government has decided to shift the offices of Deputy Director, Silk (Mulberry) and its officers and staff in the Directorate of Regional Silk Office Aurangabad and Nagpur as follows.
