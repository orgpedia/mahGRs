The Proposal:
NAFED had made it mandatory for farmers to register on the NeML portal for the purchase of tur and gram under the Price Support Scheme under the Minimum Support Price Scheme in the state for the season 2017-2018. Purchase of Toor has been stopped since 15/05/2018 and at that time, there were 1,92,076 farmers who were left to purchase Toor. Further, the procurement of Groundnut has been stopped since 13/06/2018 and remaining 2,18,608 farmers were left with Tur. Keeping in view the non-availability of adequate godowns, non-procurement of tur/ urad, arrival of monsoon in the State and demand for financial assistance from the farmers, the State Government had sanctioned financial assistance of Rs. 1000/- per quintal to the farmers who had registered themselves on NeML portal under Minimum Support Price Scheme during the season 2017-2018.
Accordingly, under the Government decision dated 19/06/2018, a financial assistance of Rs.1000/-per quintal was sanctioned to the tur producing farmers of the State. Similarly, the government was considering to provide financial assistance of Rs. 1000/- per quintal to the farmers cultivating gram.
Government's decision:
In view of the discussion and directions given in the Cabinet meeting in this regard, the following action is being taken as per the Government Decision, dated 19/06/2018 for this scheme:
A limit of 10 quintals per hectare should be fixed for providing subsidy to farmers who have registered on the NeML portal under the Minimum Support Price Scheme in the season 2017-2018, but have not purchased gram from them.

The subsidy should be fixed as per the area under cultivation on the NeML portal but within a maximum limit of 2 hectares per farmer.
(c) Farmers who have been sent SMS within the stipulated time and have sold their gram at the procurement centre at least once in the past. Also, the farmers who have not brought gram to the procurement center even after sending an SMS without any concrete reason should be disqualified.
d. Farmers registered on the NeML portal who could not send SMS within the prescribed time to bring their gram to the procurement center should be made eligible for financial assistance.
Subsidy to farmers should be allowed only in the proportion of area under gram cultivation reported on the NeML portal.
The disbursement of subsidy to the farmers registered on NeML portal should be done through the portal itself, primarily to their Aadhaar linked bank accounts and in exceptional cases to the available bank accounts.
The Managing Director, Maharashtra State Co-operative Marketing Federation will be responsible for the distribution of funds.
