The Proposal:
The non-performing assets (NPAs) of urban cooperative credit institutions in the state are increasing as they have to make provision for unpaid loans. As a result, credit institutions have to make huge provisions. This affects the credit score of the institutions. This creates a sense of insecurity among investors. As a result, some credit institutions are facing difficulties due to the decrease in the deposits of urban cooperative credit institutions and the withdrawal of large deposits in some places. Credit institutions are not performing well in loan recovery. With a view to clean up the balance sheets of the credit institutions, considering the recommendations of the Commissioner of Cooperation and Registrar, Cooperative Societies, Maharashtra State, Pune, the State Government has decided to implement the Samachar Repayment Scheme for all the Urban Cooperative Credit Institutions in the State. The approval was granted by the Government Decision of 27/9/2007. In accordance with the recovery made through this scheme, under the scheme of reimbursement of treatment No. The extension was granted under Sections 2,3,4, 5,6,7, 89 and 10.
