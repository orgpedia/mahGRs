The Proposal:
The three-tier cooperative credit structure plays an important role in providing agricultural credit to the farmers of the state. These include the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank at the state level, district central cooperative banks at the district level and primary agricultural credit cooperative societies at the village level. As on 31/03/2021, a total of 31 District Central Cooperative Banks and 20,986 Primary Agricultural Credit Cooperative Societies are functioning in the State.
In the financial year 2021-22, 54.04 lakh farmers of the state have been given financial assistance of Rs. 48,908 crore crop loans have been disbursed. Out of this, 29.79 lakh farmers have been given Rs. 18,417 crore crop loans have been disbursed through Primary Agriculture Credit Societies. It is evident from this that even today about 60% of the total farmers taking crop loans in the state are dependent on primary agricultural credit supply cooperatives for their agricultural loans.
Primary Agricultural Credit Co-operative Societies (PACS) are primarily involving farmers and rural artisans and their main objective is to promote savings and mutual assistance among the members, to meet their credit needs, to provide credit linked inputs, storage and marketing facilities for farm produce. There is a need to make these institutions viable business enterprises by providing various services to their members based on computer technology. Keeping this in mind, the Central Government has approved the scheme" Computerization of Centrally Sponsored Primary Agricultural Credit Cooperative Societies" on 29 th June, 2022 to make the Primary Agricultural Credit Cooperative Societies in the country self-reliant on the lines of" Atmanirbhar Bharat" campaign. The scheme will be implemented over a period of five years from 2022-23 to 2026-27. Under this scheme, an ambitious project of computerization of about 63,000 Primary Agricultural Credit Supply Cooperative Societies in the country will be implemented. Under this scheme, computerization of about 12,000 Primary Agricultural Credit Co-operative Societies in the state will be done.
