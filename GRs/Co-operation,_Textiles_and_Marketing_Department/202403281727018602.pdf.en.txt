| The project cost of cooperative irrigation schemes in the state has increased over the years.                                |
| There has been a steady increase, not only in the small and marginal members but also in the medium and large members.       |
| Increasing project spending has also been economically difficult for farmers.                                                |
| The farmers in the beneficiary areas of the small and big irrigation schemes are taken up.                                   |
| Water was available at no cost. In contrast, the farmers in other areas were themselves.                                     |
| They themselves bear the entire cost of their schemes if they decide to arrange for the upasa irrigation.                    |
| So, the expenditure on the beneficiary members of cooperative irrigation schemes has to be met.                              |
| In view of the above, the burden should be reduced and lifted to some extent by the government.                              |
| The decision, dated 19.11.1994 in Annexure 'A' appended to this Government decision.                                         |

| It was.                                                                                                                      |
