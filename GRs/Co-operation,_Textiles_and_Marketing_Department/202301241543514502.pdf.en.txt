Sugarcane was available in excess of the distillation capacity, especially in the area of sugar mills in Marathwada. It was necessary to order the distribution of sugarcane to filter out the excess sugarcane from other factories in the jurisdiction of such factories. In this background, the government was considering to sanction sugarcane transportation subsidy and sugarcane crushing subsidy for additional sugarcane crushing to avoid financial loss to the farmers and sugar mills.

Accordingly, 5.16 lakh tonnes of sugarcane had to be transported and their average distance was 77.5 km. Grant-in-aid@ Rs.5/-@ Rs. 5X78X 5.16= Rs. 19.99 (20 crore) is being sanctioned.
Sugarcane Siltation Subsidy: All the sugarcane of the farmers who have been sown after 1st May, 2022 for the sowing of the remaining sugarcane has been sanctioned a subsidy of Rs. For this, out of the subsidy amount of Rs.104 crore, Rs.200/-per tonne of 52 lakh tonnes of sugarcane which was harvested after 1st May, 2022 is now being approved for disbursement of funds amounting to Rs. 31.44 crore.
