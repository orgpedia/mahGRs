Government circular
The Sugar Commissioner has constituted a committee under the chairmanship of Director (Administration) of Sugar on how the officers/ employees of the cooperative sugar factory in the state should be structured and work is in progress to finalize the framework in accordance with the report submitted by the committee.
Most of the sugar mills in the state are in financial distress and it is difficult to pay the FRP of sugarcane farmers on time. Also, elections for some factories will be held in the near future. Therefore, it is necessary to control the administrative costs of the factory. And therefore, no cooperative sugar factory in the state should recruit any kind of employee until the contours of the cooperative sugar factory in the state are decided and approved by the government.
The Commissioner of Sugar, Pune shall bring the above directions to the notice of all concerned and the sugar mills and ensure that it is strictly implemented.
