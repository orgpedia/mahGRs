The Proposal:
At present, the process of empowering 5000 different executive cooperatives under the Atal Mahapan Vikas Abhiyan is underway in the state since 2016. Apart from various functional cooperatives, marketing, processing, service and other types of cooperatives are also required to carry out business oriented projects. The bylaws of such cooperatives will have to cover processing of agricultural inputs, value addition aspects as well as innovative activities covered under the scheme.

The government was contemplating to form a committee for the purpose.

The Cabinet in its meeting held on 18/11/2018 has approved the proposal regarding Atal Financial Assistance Scheme for Cooperative Societies. Every one of these plans
The following committees are being constituted to determine the background of the registered cooperatives participating in the projects, their own share capital, the amount of government loans and subsidies, the amount of share capital, loans and subsidies sanctioned in other ongoing schemes of the department.
