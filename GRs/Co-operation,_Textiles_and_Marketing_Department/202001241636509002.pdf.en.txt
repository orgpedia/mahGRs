GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: SUPPLEMENTS-2019/ Q.No. 158/24 C
Preamble: In view of the fall in the prices of onions in the state after October 2018, it has been decided to provide a subsidy of Rs 200/- per quintal to the farmers who sold onions in the Agricultural Produce Market Committee and Private Market Committee of the state from November 1, 2018 to December 15, 2018. The period of Onion Subsidy has been extended from time to time and the revised period has been fixed from 1st November, 2018 to 28th February, 2019. So far, Rs. 502.10 crore has been disbursed to 549788 farmer beneficiaries under the scheme.
As per the proposal received from Director, Marketing, Maharashtra State, Pune for disbursement of pending onion subsidy of Rs.200/- per quintal for the year 2018-2019 and Rs.100/- per quintal for the year 2016-17, a sum of Rs. 402.64 lakh has been sanctioned through Supplementary Demand in the 4th (Winter) Session of 2019.

Therefore, the Government was considering to disburse the amount of Rs. 235.00/-lakh to the eligible onion farmers of the State out of the sanctioned amount of Rs. 402.64/-lakh through Supplementary Demand.
Government Decision: As per the proposal received from the Director of Marketing, Maharashtra State, Pune, an amount of Rs. 235.00 lakh (Rs.
