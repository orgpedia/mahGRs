The major cashew plantations in the state are in Sindhudurg, Ratnagiri and Kolhapur districts. In the case of cashew crop, about 22 lakh maunds of cashew seeds are estimated. Tons are being produced and no processing is being done on it. White spirit, etc. by-products can be produced. Research has also shown that it is possible to produce fiber, feed for poultry and animal feed from the peel of cashew nuts. Therefore, the government was considering the formation of a committee to study the issue in order to set up pilot projects in Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg and Kolhapur districts to produce ethanol and CNG from cashew nuts.
Government Decision: With a view to setting up pilot projects for production of ethanol and CNG from cashew kernels in Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg and Kolhapur districts, the following committees are being constituted to study the matter.
