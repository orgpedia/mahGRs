Preamble: The Government Order. As on 8.3.2017, instructions have been issued to fix the ceiling on the cost of harvesting and transportation of sugarcane by the sugar mills. However, the Commissioner, Punjab, The following difficulties have been observed while implementing the instructions in the said circular as submitted vide letter dated 24.9.2021.
It is practically not possible to determine the distance from the factory site, according to which the distance of each farmer from the farm is actually implemented. It is difficult to define such a boundary within a radius of 25 km in agricultural lands.
(ii) If the rate of transportation of sugarcane for a maximum distance is determined as per distance, each factory will have to pay at least three different rates to the sugarcane growers.
This will create confusion among the farmers.
3. If the district/ taluk-wise divisional transport rates for sugarcane transportation are standardized and fixed, the flow of vehicle owners to the factories in the areas where transportation is easy and fuel consumption is low, the factory in the hills and hilly areas will not have enough vehicles for sugarcane transportation.
The Collector of each district has information about the rate of transportation of foodgrains and fertilizers. However, the transportation of foodgrains and fertilizers from the government godowns to the city places is done through paved roads. Sugarcane transportation rates are not available with the District Collector.
District Collector and Maharashtra State Cooperative Sugar Factory Ltd. It is difficult to determine the factory-wise transportation rate of sugar at the level of Mumbai.
