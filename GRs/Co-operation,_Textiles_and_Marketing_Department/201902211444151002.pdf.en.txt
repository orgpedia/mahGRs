The Proposal:
As per the Government Resolution No. 1, the State Government has decided to provide short-term crop loan at 6% interest to the farmers of the State. As per the policy of the central government, banks should provide loans to farmers at 6% interest rate instead of 7% where banks are going to provide loans to farmers at 7% interest rate. For this purpose, the financial burden of the 1% interest differential amount is on the government. The benefit of this decision is being given to the District Central Co-operative Banks, Nationalized Banks and Regional Rural Banks in the State during Kharif and Rabi seasons since 2006-07 and to the private banks who have disbursed short term crop loans up to Rs. 3.00 lakh to the farmers since 2013-14.
The government was considering sanctioning funds under the financial assistance scheme at the rate of 1 per cent for providing short term crop loans to farmers for the current financial year 2018-19.
