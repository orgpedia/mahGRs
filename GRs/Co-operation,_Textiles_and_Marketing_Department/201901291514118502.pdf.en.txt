Read: History of 25th Meeting of State Level Project Approval Committee of National Agriculture Development Scheme RKV 0518/ C.R. 162/14-A, Dy. August 27, 2018
Introduction: As per the guidelines issued by the Central Government under the National Agriculture Development Scheme, Ma. Chief Secretary, Government of Maharashtra. The State Level Project Clearance Committee (SLSC) has been constituted under the Government Decision dated 20th September, 2007. It was held on July 25, 2018. In this meeting, the Maharashtra State Warehousing Corporation had submitted a proposal to upgrade the warehouses in the tribal areas. The Maharashtra State Warehousing Corporation has been implementing the programme of setting up warehouses for storage of agricultural produce since 1957. Till date, the Corporation has disbursed Rs. 17.25 lakh. Tonne storage capacity has been created. " There are 17 districts in Maharashtra. These districts are- Aurangabad, Bhandara, Buldhana, Chandrapur, Dhule, Gadchiroli, Nandurbar, Nashik, Yavatmal, Washim, Wardha, Parbhani, Gondia, Jalgaon, Jalgaon, Jalna, Latur, Nagpur, Gondia, Jalgaon, Beed, Parbhani, Nandurbar, Hingoli, Osmanabad, Palghar, and Thane. " With the upgradation of warehousing facilities in the tribal areas, it will largely benefit the farmers for storing foodgrains. According to the report submitted by the corporation, it has become necessary to upgrade the warehouses by providing facilities such as removing cement sheets from the warehouses in the tribal section, installing galvalume sheets in their place, building a protective wall around the warehouse, concreting the road in some warehouse complexes and installing grill rolling shutters in some places. By creating such facilities, the godowns can be used for storage at full capacity for the farmers. Therefore, e-Vacar bags, NCDEX etc. facilities can be made available at such Vacar centres. This will enable the farmers to avail of the loan waiver scheme. According to the then available construction technology, cement sheets have been installed in the godowns of the corporation. Cement sheets are made of asbestos. Asbestos has been shown to cause lung cancer. Asbestos has been banned in 52 countries. The Maharashtra State Warehousing Corporation's godowns are stocked with man-made food grains and since these godowns have cement sheets with asbestos used in them, the use of these grains in the godowns can lead to a serious disease like lung cancer.

693/30/97-98 Replace all asbestos sheets roofing with roofing made up of some other material that would not be harmful to inmates. This has been clarified.
Also because of the presence of mud roads in the warehouse complex, a lot of dust accumulates on the packets of food grains stored in the godowns. A large amount of this dust is mixed with food from the linen bags. Also, during the rainy season, the roads in the Wakhar complex are not suitable for traffic as the surface of the road is not up to the standard. Therefore, during the rainy season, farmers, traders and hoarders have space left in the warehouse, but they cannot use it. The roads in the area need to be repaired. Also, it is necessary to build a protective wall on all sides for the safety of warehouses. As the temperature is increasing day by day, to improve the old-fashioned ventilation facility, grill rolling shutters are installed from the outside of the warehouse to keep the air flowing and the food grain supply remains good. Also, the corporation has set up a 3150 m2 farm considering the needs of local farmers in Mahur. It has been decided to take up projects including state-of-the-art warehouses of tonnage capacity, buildings, concrete roads, defence infrastructure.
However, considering the limited sources of income and funds available with the Maharashtra State Warehousing Corporation, it is not possible for the Maharashtra State Warehousing Corporation to carry out a combined programme of warehouse upgradation in tribal areas, for the year 2018-19 under the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana, the construction of a new upgraded warehouse at Mahur under the Maharashtra State Warehousing Corporation's Warehousing Facilities Improvement in Tribal Areas through the upgradation of warehouses, replacement of asbestos used cement sheets, installation of galvalume sheets with turbo ventilators, installation of grill rolling shutters, construction of safety wall, etc. A sum of Rs. 73.08 crore has been sanctioned. The project cost is Rs. 73.08 crore, out of which Maharashtra State Warehousing Corporation has contributed Rs. 18.08 crore and Rs. Rs 55.00 crore. Administrative and financial sanction for this expenditure was under consideration of the Government.
Government decision:
