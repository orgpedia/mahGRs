GOVERNMENT DECISION, NO.: SAPAS-2018/ P.No. 169/24-C
Ministry, Extension, Mumbai-32
The date: June 19, 2018.
Reference:- (1) Decisions of the State Cabinet Meeting dated 05/06/2018 (2) Government Memorandum, Finance Division No.
Date is June 8, 2018
(3) Government Memorandum, Finance Division No:- Shahmi-2018/ S.P.V./ S.No.46/ Finance, dated 15th June, 2018
The Proposal:
NAFED had appointed State Nodal Agencies for procurement of Tur and Gram under Price Support Scheme (PSS) under Minimum Support Price (MSP) in the State for the season 2017-18. For the first time this year, it was made mandatory for farmers to register on the NeML portal for the purchase of tur and gram. As per the information available on NeML Portal, subject to the targets given by NAFED, the total procurement of Tur as on 15/5/2018 and Chana as on 11/6/2018 is as under:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| The type of crop    | Purchased     | Beneficiary farmers | The total purchase price |
| Toor                | 33,67, 177.48 | 2,65,854            | Rs. 1835.11 crore        |
| Chickpeas (lentils) | 13,69, 184.46 | 99,161              | Rs. 602.44               |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Purchase of tur and gram in the state started at a very slow pace as the godowns in the state were completely full due to the large-scale purchase of tur in the last season. The State Warehousing Corporation has taken on lease 183 godowns other than the Corporation in the State. However, this storage facility is very inadequate. Presently, rainfall across the State is receding. The monsoon is expected to arrive in the second week of June. Due to the unavailability of space for the storage of purchased tur and gram in the state, the registered farmers have been limited to buying and storing tur and gram.
Purchase of Toor has been stopped since 15/5/2018 and 1,92,076 farmers are left with Toor. Further, the procurement of Gram has been stopped since 13/6/2018 and balance 2,18,608 farmers are left to procure Tur.

GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: SAPAS-2018/ PR No. 169/24-C
Considering the non-availability of adequate godowns, non-procurement of expected quantity of Tur/ Urad, arrival of monsoon in the State and demand for financial assistance from the farmers, in the season 2017-18, the farmers registered on the NeML portal under Minimum Support Price (MSP) scheme will be given Rs.
1000/- per quintal was under consideration of the Government.
Government's decision:
In view of the discussion and directions given in the cabinet meeting in this regard, the following action is being taken for this scheme:
A limit of 10 quintals per hectare should be fixed for providing subsidy to farmers who have registered on the NeML portal under the Minimum Support Price Scheme in the season 2017-18, but have not purchased tur from them.
The subsidy should be fixed as per the area under cultivation on the NeML portal but within a maximum limit of 2 hectares per farmer.
(c) Farmers who have been sent SMS within the stipulated time and have sold tur at least once in the past. Also, the farmers who have not brought tur to the procurement center even after sending an SMS, without any concrete reason, should be disqualified.
d. Farmers registered on the NeML portal who could not send SMS within the prescribed time to bring tur to the procurement center should be made eligible for financial assistance.
In case of a farmer whose area under cultivation has been incorrectly recorded on the NeML portal, the Managing Director, Maharashtra State Cooperative Marketing Federation, Mumbai, should ensure that the area under the tur crop is correct based on proper procedures and the subsidy should be disbursed to the bank account linked to the Aadhaar card of the farmer.
The subsidy will be disbursed to the farmers registered on the NeML portal through the portal itself in their Aadhaar linked bank accounts.
The Managing Director, Maharashtra State Co-operative Marketing Federation will be responsible for the distribution of funds.
