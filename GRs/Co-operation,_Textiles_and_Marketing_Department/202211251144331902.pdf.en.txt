(1) The Government Resolution No. Policy-2011/ P.No.335/ Tex-2D January 2, 2012) Government Resolution, Supp. Policy-2012/ S.No.1/ Tax-2D Proposed March 1, 2012
Under the Textile Policy 2011-17 of the State of Maharashtra, Reference No. 2 The scheme of interest subvention scheme for long term loans has been announced as per the decision of the Government. The duration of the project is 2 years. Subsequent period of establishment is not eligible under this scheme. However, during the Covid-19 period, the RBI had provided an additional moratorium period to the industry. Accordingly, the banks have submitted their proposals seeking subsidy for the textile projects to the government along with the construction period. Thus, by filing a proposal for an additional moratorium period, the amount of repayment in that proposal does not decrease and remains as it is, so the additional interest subsidy becomes payable to the government. Additional grants are not available. Therefore, even if the banks have given a moratorium period to textile projects, it is necessary to file subsidy claims as per the original repayment schedule of the projects while seeking subsidy from the government. All such claims filed with the government with additional moratorium will be cancelled at the government level. Therefore, the government was considering to instruct the banks not to file proposals by giving more moratorium period.
Similarly, in the interest subsidy scheme, after the completion of the quarter of the project, the bank is required to submit a proposal for their subsidy in the next quarter. However, banks often file claims for the project without doing so. Therefore, many years of subsidy claims are filed together at the government level. While the interest subvention scheme is in the final stages, many projects for 2012, 2013, 2014 have not been claimed by banks. In view of this, the government was considering giving a deadline to banks to file claims under the interest subsidy scheme by December 2021.

Government Resolution No: SANKIRN-2022/ PR No.437/ TEX-5
Government's decision
In view of the information given in the preamble, proposals should not be filed by banks under the interest subvention scheme under the state's textile policy by giving the benefit of moratorium other than that prescribed in this scheme. Even if the banks have given an additional moratorium period to the textile projects, the banks should file subsidy claims as per the original repayment schedule of the projects while seeking subsidy from the government. Thus, the proposals that have been submitted to the government under the additional moratorium will be reset from the government level.
Banks are being given one month's time from the date of this Government decision to file all claims under the Interest Subvention Scheme under the Textile Policy by December 2021. Applications will not be accepted after December 2021. Also, the bank should not file claims for the projects that are NPA and if the project is NPA, then the government should be informed about it.
