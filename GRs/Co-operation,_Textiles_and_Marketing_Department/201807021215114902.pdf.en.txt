Ministry (Extension), Mumbai 400 032.
Date: 30th of June 2018
About 2 lakh cooperative societies are functioning in the state with a membership of about 5.5 crore. The State's share capital is around Rs. 6 lakh crore.
In the cooperative sector, various executive cooperative societies, district central cooperative banks, cooperative sugar factories, cooperative spinning mills, machine mill cooperatives, cooperative agricultural marketing and processing societies, central cooperative consumer societies, urban/ rural non-agricultural cooperative credit societies, cooperative milk producers' unions, industrial cooperatives etc. are contributing significantly to the rural economy of the state.
All cooperative societies in the state are expected to function subject to the provisions of the Cooperative Act, rules, bye-laws of the organization, guidelines of NABARD and policy decisions of the government. However, it has been observed that some of the institutions have taken decisions in violation of the provisions of the Act, rules, bye-laws and policy decisions of the government, leading to financial distress. In this regard, it is necessary to make an in-depth study of the class of some major co-operative institutions and make a proper assessment of the functioning of these institutions and take measures to improve them qualitatively. Accordingly, a proposal was under the consideration of the government to form a committee to conduct a thorough study to evaluate the functioning of cooperative sugar factories in the state and make qualitative improvements.
Government Decision: The following committee is being constituted to make a thorough study on the evaluation of the functioning of the cooperative sugar factories in the state and to make qualitative improvements in them.
