Introduction: The cooperative sector has been a major influence in the economic development of Maharashtra. There are about 2.25 lakh cooperative societies of various types in the state and the importance of urban cooperative banks is unique among them.
At present, there are about 458 urban cooperative banks in the state, which are under the dual control of the state government and the Reserve Bank. Although registered under the Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act, the day-to-day operations of these banks are governed by the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and the directions issued by the Reserve Bank of India.

The following Committee of Eminent Persons is being constituted under the Chairmanship of the Minister (Cooperation& Marketing).
