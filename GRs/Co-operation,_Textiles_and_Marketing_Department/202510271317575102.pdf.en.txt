| 4. Department of Finance Government Circular No. Finance-2025 / Q. 4 4 / Finance-3, dated 07.04.2025                   |
|                                                                                                                        |
| The Proposal: -                                                                                                        |
| The project cost of cooperative irrigation schemes in the state has increased over the years.                          |
| There are frequent floods, so not only the small and marginal farmer members, but also the medium and large ones.      |
| Increasing project spending has also made it economically difficult for farmers.                                       |
| The farmers in the beneficiary areas of the small and big irrigation schemes are taken up.                             |
| Water was available at no cost. In contrast, the farmers in other areas were themselves.                               |
| If they decide to arrange for the irrigation of the Upsa, they will have the entire gamut of their plans on their own. |
| So, the expenditure on the beneficiary members of cooperative irrigation schemes has to be met.                        |
| In view of the above, the burden should be reduced and lifted to some extent by the government.                        |
| The decision, dated 19.11.1994 in Annexure 'A' appended to this Government decision.                                   |
| Subject to the terms and conditions provided by the Department of Finance, the                                         |
| Government to provide financial assistance to cooperative irrigation schemes during the financial year                 |
| was under consideration.                                                                                               |
| The Government's Decision-                                                                                             |
