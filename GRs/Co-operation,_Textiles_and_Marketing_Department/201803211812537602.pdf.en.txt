GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: HSG-2507/ Q.No.266/ Revised/ 18-C
It has increased more than half. The construction of the institution is in an incomplete state, as the government has not yet disbursed the entire loan amount due to lack of sufficient funds. The government has allowed members to take loans from other financial institutions to complete the construction as well as to meet the difference in the increased cost of the houses. As per the Government Decision dated 20.9.2010. The institute has decided to complete the partial construction of the institute by taking loans from other financial institutions and collecting contributions from the members. Since the Government has decided to increase the construction cost by 30-40% with effect from 14.8.2012, the financial burden will also be on the members. Considering the fact that the disbursed loan of the members is less than the sanctioned loan, the member will have to return the excess recovery amount if the amount is recovered more than the disbursed loan, considering the delay in receiving funds from the government, a proposal was under consideration of the government to restructure the total number of repayment installments as in the case of disbursed loan and to restructure the estimated cost of houses due to 40 to 50 percent increase in construction cost.
Government Decision- Financial Assistance to State Government/ Zilla Parishad Employees Cooperative Housing Societies Under this scheme, the details of the loan sanctioned and disbursed by the Government to Rajnigandha Cooperative Housing Society, Sahajapur, T. G. Aurangabad, so far, are as follows.
