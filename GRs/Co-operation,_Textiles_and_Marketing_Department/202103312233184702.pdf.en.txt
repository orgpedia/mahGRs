| The project cost of cooperative lift irrigation schemes in the state has been continuously increasing in the last few years    |
| This is not only for small and marginal farmers but also for medium and large farmers.                                         |
| Increasing project costs have made it financially difficult.                                                                   |

| On the contrary, farmers in other areas should arrange for their own irrigation.                                               |
| If decided, they have to bear the entire cost of their schemes themselves.                                                     |

| Java, in view of the aforesaid Government Decision dated 19.11.1994 along with the said Government Decision.                   |
| Subject to the conditions in Annexure A annexed, the Finance Department may provide in the revised estimates                   |
| Financial assistance for Cooperative lift irrigation schemes during 2020-21                                                    |
| The matter was under consideration of the government.                                                                          |
