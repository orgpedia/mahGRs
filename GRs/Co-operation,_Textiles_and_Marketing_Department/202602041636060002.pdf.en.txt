Date: February 4, 2026
Read: - 1. The Executive Board of the Department of Law and Justice (2A). The 04/09/2025 daily checklist.

The Proposal: -
The theme 'Review of obsolete laws to be done by TE' has been included in the ATH Action Plan prepared for the year 2025-2026 under HART. In general, obsolete laws are laws that have become irrelevant or obsolete over time.
Some pre-independence laws have become obsolete and are no longer in use. However, such laws are still in force. The Act, therefore, needs to be reviewed and, where necessary, appropriate steps taken to repeal or re-enact it.
It was under the consideration of the Government to constitute a Committee under the Chairmanship of the Commissioner and Registrar of Co-operatives, Maharashtra State, Pune to review the obsolete Acts relating to the Co-operative Department and to make favourable changes with regard to repeal or re-enactment of these Acts.
Government Orders: -
The Government is approving the constitution of the following Committee under the Chairmanship of the Cooperative Commissioner and Registrar, Cooperative Societies, State of Maharashtra, Pune, to review the obsolete Acts and formulate rules for repeal or re-enactment of the said Acts.
Commissioner and Registrar of Cooperatives, Cooperative Societies, Maharashtra State, Pune (Chairman)
