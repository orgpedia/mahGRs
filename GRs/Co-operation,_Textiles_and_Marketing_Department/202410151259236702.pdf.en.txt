No. 126/2 -C, Date 29/07/2015 8. Government Decision Serial Date 12.1.2024
The Proposal: -
In February 2015, the Government decided to pay interest subvention amount of 3 months to the farmers affected by the calamity due to unseasonal rain and hailstorm on the condition that the panchnama is available. The decision has been taken by the government in 8. Taking this condition into account, 652 eligible account holders in Ratnagiri district will be paid Rs. The interest on the 55.82 Taka amount has been waived off.
However, as per the report submitted by the Resident Deputy Collector, Ratnagiri to the Government dated 19.9.2024 in February 2015, untimely rains and hailstorms in Ratnagiri district have caused loss of more than 50% of the total area of 38, 287.69 hectares to 87,361 farmers of Mango Horticulture covering 24, 744.04 hectares and Cashew Horticulture covering 13, 543.65 hectares. Considering this, it has been observed that farmers who do not have access to panchnama have not received the benefit of this interest subvention. However, since the above-mentioned borrower farmers are required to get the benefit of interest subvention, the government was considering omitting the condition of panchnama in the government decision in question.
Government Decision: - 1) The condition of panchnama is being omitted for payment of 3 months interest subvention to farmers who have suffered crop loss due to unseasonal rains and hailstorms in the month of February and March 2015.
2) This exemption shall not be construed as a precedent in other cases.

3) Reference No. The other terms and conditions of the Government Decision No. 8 shall remain in force.
4) Orders to make available the above interest subvention amount shall be issued separately.
