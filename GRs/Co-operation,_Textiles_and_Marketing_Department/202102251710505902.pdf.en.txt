This relaxation has been made applicable as per the Government decision at Reference No. 4.

The government was considering allowing submission of registration applications in any form, including online and on-site registration.
Government's decision
In view of the facts stated in the Preamble, the registration application for the holders of machinery with less than 27 horsepower load can be made either online or through an on-site application.
A registration form is available for submission.
27 The holders of machinery having less than two horsepower load shall submit their registration form to the Commissioner (Textiles), Nagpur, either on-site or online on their website.
