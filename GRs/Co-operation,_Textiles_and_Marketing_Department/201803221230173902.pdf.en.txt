Introduction: The silk industry is an industry with huge employment potential based on agriculture and forest resources. Through this industry, it is possible to stop the migration of people from rural areas to the economic level and urban areas. It is the only industry that provides employment opportunities to people of all age groups. Considering the importance of the silk industry and the scope for employment generation, the government has decided to take several measures in the new Textile Policy 2018-23 of the state in reference number 3 to bring the silk industry to the center of the state's economy. Accordingly, it was under consideration of the Government to encourage private entrepreneurs for mulberry/ tussar cultivation on the lines of farmers.
Government Decision: The Government's policy is to promote post-harvest production process in the state so that the silk produced by the farmers of the state under the Silk Extension and Development Program is available in the market within the state. Accordingly, the Government hereby approves to provide subsidy on silk yarn production by Multi-end Reeling Units and Automatic Reeling Units as per the following details per kg.
