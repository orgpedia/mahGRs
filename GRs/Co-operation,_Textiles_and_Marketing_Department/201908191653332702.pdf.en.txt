To begin with, Rs. 114.80 crore has been made available to the Director, Marketing, Maharashtra State, Pune from the Contingency Fund for disbursement of admissible subsidy to 1,60,698 beneficiary farmers who have sold onions from 1st November, 2018 to 15th December, 2018.
For the remaining period from 16.12.2018 to 28.02.2019, a supplementary demand of Rs. 387,30,31, 000 for onion subsidy was approved in the 2nd (Monsoon) Session of 2019. The subsidy should be disbursed to the farmers at the earliest.
Since disbursement of subsidy in the initial period through nationalised banks takes a long time, the Director of Marketing, Maharashtra State, Pune vide letter dated 22nd May, 2019 had requested to allow opening of a standalone account with a private bank for disbursement of onion subsidy. Accordingly, to ensure timely and transparent payment of onion subsidy to farmers, the government was considering allowing them to open savings accounts in ICICI Bank.
Government has approved the opening of Zero Balance Savings Account in ICICI Bank for providing subsidy of Rs.200/- per quintal to the onion farmers of the State for the year 2018-2019 subject to the following conditions:
Terms and Conditions: I. The savings account opened in ICICI Bank for the onion subsidy scheme should be used only for depositing and disbursing the funds of the scheme.
(ii) The interest received from the savings account should be used for the purpose of implementing the scheme.
(iii) The balance in the said bank account shall be required to be adjusted against the Government.
