Introduction Textile and Apparel industry has witnessed panoramic changes for decades and is now
going through another paradigm shift in terms of automation in manufacturing technologies
and processes. India is a world leader in textiles from fiber to apparel and has a very promising
value chain in place in respect to the changing processes and technologies. Textile Industry
plays an important role in the national economy owing to its major contribution to GDP,
industrial production, employment, and exports. The country is the world's second-largest
producer of textiles and garments and the fifth-largest exporter of textiles spanning apparel,
home and technical products. The textiles and apparel industry contribute 2.3% to the country's
GDP, 13% to industrial production and 12% to exports. The textile industry is one of the largest
sources of employment generation in the country with an estimated 45 million people directly
engaged in this sector including women and rural population.
2. Government of India is implementing various schemes catering exclusively for
promotion and development of textile sector on pan-India basis viz the Production Linked
Incentives Scheme, Amended Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme (A-TUFS), Schemes for
the development of the Powerloom Sector (Power-Tex), Scheme for Integrated Textile Parks
(SITP), SAMARTH- The Scheme for Capacity Building in Textile Sector, Jute (ICARE
Improved Cultivation and Advanced Retting Exercise), Integrated Processing Development
Scheme (IPDS), Silk Samagra, National Handloom Development Programme, National
Handicraft Development Programme, Integrated Wool Development Programme (IWDP) etc.
Technical textiles, a sunrise sector, accounts for approximately 13% of India's total
textile and apparel market, contributing 0.7% to India's GDP and supporting vast array of other
industries. The global growth rate of the technical textile will increase at approximately 4.9%
from 2022-2030. The Indian market is brimming with remarkable opportunities in technical
textiles and various schemes and initiatives such as National Technical Textile Mission and
Production Linked Incentives (PLI) are emphasizing extensively on the importance of technical
textiles in boosting the economy.
4. Maharashtra comprises a significant chapter in the remarkable growth story of India as
a textile's powerhouse. The textile sector plays a crucial role in the state's economy, being the
second-largest employment enabler in Maharashtra, after agriculture. The State accounts for
10.4% of the country's total textile and apparel production and 10.2% of the total employment

ii. Post the set period of 2 years, no electricity subsidy will be provided. However, the
subsidy amount of 12 months will be calculated and provided as capital subsidy for
establishment of solar power plant.
iii. The guiding principles for the solar project for the existing units will be as follows
O The DPR for solar plant shall be weighed and approved by Maharashtra Energy
Development Agency (MEDA) or any other such agency decided by the Govt
from time to time.
O The capital subsidy (electricity subsidy for 12 months/ cost of the power plant
up to maximum of 4 MW/ capping of INR 4.8 crore, whichever is less) will be
provided in 2 equal instalments (with a gap of six months between the
instalments) post the operationalization of solar power plant.
iv. There will be a cap of INR 40 lakh per unit per month on the disbursement of monthly
electricity subsidy.
V. For new units/ units undertaking expansion, units will include the cost of installation of
solar power plant in the Detailed Project Report (DPR) and the capital subsidy will be
calculated on the fixed capital investment (eligible plant and machinery and solar plant)
up to maximum of 4MW capacity.
vi. Although Textile Units/Projects can establish solar plants of more than 4MW capacity,
the entire financial burden for establishing capacity over 4MW shall be borne by the
unit/project itself.
vii. In any case the total capacity of solar powerplant being established shall not exceed the
approved load / contract demand of conventional energy.
Important to Note
After the installation of solar power plant units, it shall be the responsibility of the
textile units to maintain its operationality. For any reason, if the solar power generation
unit goes unserviceable, the tariff for electricity being supplied by Maharashtra State
Electricity Distribution Co. Ltd. (MSEDCL) will be applicable without any subsidies/
reductions.
There shall be no cap of 1MW on Net Metering for the textile units.
The State Government's Energy Department will not levy charges other than
"transmission charges" on projects using non-conventional sources (solar, wind, etc.)
of energy.
When any unit is simultaneously using conventional and non-conventional power, the
use of both the power sources will be taken into consideration to decide the load factor.

ii. Post the set period of 2 years, no electricity subsidy will be provided. However, the
subsidy amount of 12 months will be calculated and provided as capital subsidy for
establishment of solar power plant.
iii. The guiding principles for the solar project for the existing units will be as follows
O The DPR for solar plant shall be weighed and approved by Maharashtra Energy
Development Agency (MEDA) or any other such agency decided by the Govt.
from time to time.
O The capital subsidy (electricity subsidy for 12 months/ cost of the power plant
up to maximum of 4 MW/ capping of INR 4.8 crore, whichever is less) will be
provided in 2 equal instalments (with a gap of six months between the
instalments) post the operationalization of solar power plant.
iv. There will be a cap of INR 40 lakh per unit per month on the disbursement of monthly
electricity subsidy.
V. For new units/ units undertaking expansion, units will include the cost of installation of
solar power plant in the Detailed Project Report (DPR) and the capital subsidy will be
calculated on the fixed capital investment (eligible plant and machinery and solar plant)
up to maximum of 4MW capacity.
vi. Although Textile Units/Projects can establish solar plants of more than 4MW capacity,
the entire financial burden for establishing capacity over 4MW shall be borne by the
unit/project itself.
vii. In any case the total capacity of solar powerplant being established shall not exceed the
approved load / contract demand of conventional energy.
Important to Note
After the installation of solar power plant units, it shall be the responsibility of the
textile units to maintain its operationality. For any reason, if the solar power generation
unit goes unserviceable, the tariff for electricity being supplied by Maharashtra State
Electricity Distribution Co. Ltd. (MSEDCL) will be applicable without any subsidies/
reductions.
There shall be no cap of 1MW on Net Metering for the textile units.
The State Government's Energy Department will not levy charges other than
"transmission charges" on projects using non-conventional sources (solar, wind, etc.)
of energy.
When any unit is simultaneously using conventional and non-conventional power, the
use of both the power sources will be taken into consideration to decide the load factor.

iii. The guiding principles for the solar project for the existing units will be as follows
O The DPR for solar plant shall be weighed and approved by Maharashtra Energy
Development Agency (MEDA) or any other such agency decided by the Govt
from time to time.
O The capital subsidy (electricity subsidy for 12 months/ cost of the power plant
up to maximum of 4 MW/ capping of INR 4.8 crore, whichever is less) will be
provided in 2 equal instalments (with a gap of six months between the
instalments) post the operationalization of solar power plant.
iv. There will be a cap of INR 40 lakh per unit per month on the disbursement of monthly
electricity subsidy.
V. For new units/ units undertaking expansion, units will include the cost of installation of
solar power plant in the Detailed Project Report (DPR) and the capital subsidy will be
calculated on the fixed capital investment (eligible plant and machinery and solar plant)
up to maximum of 4MW capacity.
vi. Although Textile Units/Projects can establish solar plants of more than 4MW capacity,
the entire financial burden for establishing capacity over 4MW shall be borne by the
unit/project itself.
vii. In any case the total capacity of solar powerplant being established shall not exceed the
approved load / contract demand of conventional energy.
Important to Note
After the installation of solar power plant units, it shall be the responsibility of the

unit goes unserviceable, the tariff for electricity being supplied by Maharashtra State
Electricity Distribution Co. Ltd. (MSEDCL) will be applicable without any subsidies/
reductions.
There shall be no cap of 1MW on Net Metering for the textile units.
The State Government's Energy Department will not levy charges other than
"transmission charges" on projects using non-conventional sources (solar, wind, etc.)
of energy.
When any unit is simultaneously using conventional and non-conventional power, the
use of both the power sources will be taken into consideration to decide the load factor.
