The Proposal:
The Textile Policy of the State has been announced as per the decision of the Government at Reference No. 1. Under this policy, a concession in electricity rates has been announced for textile projects. As announced in the policy, power subsidy has been extended to textile projects as per Government decisions in Reference No. 4. Textile projects are required to submit self-declaration form to the government as per the directions given in this government decision. However, despite repeated requests, some projects have not submitted their self-declaration forms and certificates to the government.

In the complaints received by the government as well as in the investigation of the vigilance and control team, irregularities have been found in most of the textile projects and the government has found irregularities in some textile projects. Similarly, the government has received many complaints that other industries in the name of textile industry are taking advantage of the textile power subsidy. In such a situation, it is very important to avoid the misuse of government funds.
Currently, the state is reeling under the Covid-19 crisis. The government is also providing power subsidy to the textile industry in the state which has faced many problems like cyclone, unseasonal rain. But if some industries are misusing government subsidies in this way, then it is the responsibility of the government to impose strict penalties on them. Keeping this in mind, the government was considering a thorough examination of the textile projects receiving subsidy under the Electricity Tariff Concession Scheme under the Textile Policy 2018-23.
Considering the information in the Government Resolution Preamble, all the Textile Industry projects which are availing power subsidy scheme under Textile Policy 2018-23, except machinery having less than 27 HP, are getting power subsidy. Similarly, all the textile projects which are registering for availing the benefit of power subsidy should do the following.
(1) The industries whose power supply is suspended or closed or those who are submitting a proposal for seeking power supply should submit the proposal online on the website of the Commissioner (Textiles) as per the provisions of this Government Order.
The proposal should also provide information about the electricity bills for the last 6 months, as well as the total electricity consumption of the project, such as industrial, labor settlements, their offices and other uses, as well as the electricity meter used for it.
The projects for which the power rebate is being given regularly are being given 10 days to submit proposals as above. The power subsidy of the projects that do not receive proposals in this period will be stopped. After receiving the proposal, the power will be applied to these projects with the approval of the government after thorough examination of the proposal.
The Vigilance and Control Team of the Department will regularly check whether the information submitted by the projects in the power subsidy proposal received by the government as well as the information contained in the project is the same or not. If the team's investigation reveals a discrepancy between the information presented by the project and the actual information

If there is, or the project has submitted incorrect or false information, the power concession and other concessions of that project will be stopped immediately. Also, all the grants given earlier will be recovered with interest.
4. The Commissioner (Textiles) shall make provision on his website for submission of proposals for textile projects as prescribed in this Government Order. Further, the Commissioner (Textiles), after receiving the proposals of textile projects, shall submit the proposals received for approval of the Government as per the instructions given in the Government Reference No. 8. Similarly, as per the instructions given in this government decision, the MSEDCL should be instructed to stop the power subsidy for the projects whose proposals will not be received within the stipulated time or if the government rejects the proposals received, and the action taken report should be submitted to the government regularly.
5. Projects which have already submitted proposals as per the annexure to this Government Resolution.
Those projects do not need to be re-submitted. Also, the projects whose power concession is closed due to non-submission of self-declaration form and have not submitted the proposal should also submit the proposal immediately.
6) The instructions given in accordance with this government decision are effective immediately. Therefore, the textile projects should submit their proposals online on the website of the Commissioner (Textiles) as per the provisions of this Government Order. The information presented in the proposal will be the responsibility of the textile project.
