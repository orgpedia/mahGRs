Textile Policy of the State of Maharashtra, 2011-17. has been announced on 02.01.2012. Under this policy, the government has decided to provide interest subsidy on long-term loans related to the centrally sponsored TUFS scheme. 01.03.2012 has been made applicable to the textile industries in the State. Since the interest subvention scheme was linked to the TUFS scheme of the central government, only the textile industries registered under the TUFS could benefit under the state scheme. Textile industries in the state were deprived of the state government's textile subsidy scheme as they were getting UID under TUFS late due to the central government's quota system.
Considering this, the state government has taken the decision. As on 21.02.2014, it has been decided to de-link the interest subvention scheme of the State Government with the Centrally Sponsored TUFS Scheme. The government has taken the decision. As on 21.02.2014, interest subvention ranging from 5% to 7% has been provided to textile projects in the State depending upon the type of textile industry. It came into effect from 21.02.2014. The interest rates on loans of banks in the prevailing situation were taken into account while implementing the subsidy. However, the interest rates on bank loans have come down. As a result, the financing banks were facing difficulties in submitting subsidy claims to the interest subsidy scheme of the state government. An explanation was sought from the government in this regard.
Government Decision: The government has taken a decision to provide financial assistance to the textile industries in the state. As per 21/02/2014, while submitting the claim for interest subsidy, the following steps should be taken.
(a) The government's decision. Under the De-LINK Scheme, as on 21.02.2014, banks are required to submit claims for interest subvention at a maximum limit of 5%, 6% and 7%, whichever is lower, after taking into account the actual rate of interest charged on the loan or 12.50% or PLR or Base Rate, whichever is lower.
Accordingly, banks should submit claims for interest subsidy for textile projects after taking into account the subsidy as per the interest rates mentioned in the table below.
