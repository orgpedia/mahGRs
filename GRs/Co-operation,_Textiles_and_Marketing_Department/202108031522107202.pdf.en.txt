The number of directors of these institutions is more than 25 lakh and the number of employees is about 3.5 lakh.
As per Section 24A of the Co-operative Act, it is mandatory for a co-operative society to impart co-operative education and training to its members, directors and officers/ employees.
In view of the above, Reference No. 1 The circular here lays down the criteria for recognition of cooperative training institutions as State Apex Training Institutions. As per Section 24-A of the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960, some institutions in the state have been notified as State Apex Training Institutes. However, in view of the large number of members of cooperative societies in the state and the obligation to train these members at least once in 5 years, some institutions are still designated as training institutions.
