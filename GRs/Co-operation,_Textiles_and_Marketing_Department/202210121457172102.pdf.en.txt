Sugar Commissionerate Pune made a presentation on the report submitted by the study group. It presented detailed information on the purpose of setting up the study group, the factories inspected, observations made by the study group, analysis based on the observations and recommendations made to the government based on it. The matter of determining the amount of five percent deduction if the sugarcane is harvested by the sugarcane crushing machine after considering these factors
was under consideration. The government has taken the following decisions:
Government Decision: Clause 3 (A) (iv) of the Sugarcane Control (Order), 1966 provides that the Central Government or the State Government or the Director of Agriculture or the Commissioner of Sugarcane or the District Magistrate may, in the case of supply of sugarcane in the concerned jurisdiction, grant appropriate rebate at the minimum price or the agreed price, as the case may be, not exceeding the estimated cost of" plucking and transportation." Subject to this provision, the Government have approved to deduct a total weight of 4.5 per cent from the weight of sugarcane harvested by the sugarcane harvester.
