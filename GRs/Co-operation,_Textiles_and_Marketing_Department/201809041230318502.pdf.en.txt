Introduction: To get a fair and reasonable price for the farmer's farm, the farmer's farm must be replicated. Since there is no grain cleaning machine in the market committee for the return of the farm produce, the return of the farm produce cannot be done at the same place. If the grain sieving machine is installed in the premises of the market committee for cleaning the grain, the farmers can be provided with the facility of grain exchange at the same place and so that the farmers can get a good price for the agricultural goods, so the government was considering to install grain sieving machine in 31 agricultural market committees in the state.
Government Decision: The National Agriculture Development Scheme (NADS) has been approved in the 24th SLSC meeting held on 15/12/2017 to set up grain sieving machines in 31 agricultural market committees of the state. Further, in the 25th SLSC Meeting held on 25/07/2018, funds have been made available for the financial year 2018-19 under the NKV Scheme. It is proposed to set up 31 new grain sieving machines in 31 market committees of the state for the cleaning and percolation of incoming grain class agricultural products. The total cost of the project is Rs. 20.21 crore, out of which 25% subsidy will be provided by the National Agriculture Development Scheme. Rs. 5.05 crore. 75% of the fund will be provided by the Market Committee. Therefore, administrative approval is being given to set up grain sieving machines in 31 agricultural market committees in the state.
