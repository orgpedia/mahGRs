The Proposal: -
The non-performing assets (NPAs) of the credit institutions are on the rise as the civil cooperative credit institutions in the state have to make provision for unpaid collateral loans. As a result, the credit institutions have to make huge provisions. This is affecting the self-financing of credit institutions. This creates a sense of insecurity among the depositors. As a result of this, some credit institutions have been in trouble as large deposits are being withdrawn in some places due to the depreciation of the deposits of the civil cooperative credit institutions. Credit institutions do not show substantial performance in debt resolution. With a view to clean up the balance sheets of credit institutions, the Cooperative Commissioner and Registrar, Cooperative Societies, Maharashtra State, Pune have recommended a Compensation Repayment Scheme for all the Civil Cooperative Credit Societies in the State. Government approval was granted under the Government Decision of 27/9/2007. Recovery through this scheme is in line with the Compensation Repayment Scheme under reference No.
Extends were given as per 2, 3, 4,5,6, 7,8,9, 10, 12, 13,14,15, 16 and 17.
