the order
Whereas, the Department of Public Health has initiated the implementation of Sections 2, 3 and 4 of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1887 in the State vide notification dated 14th March, 2020, citing the health emergency due to the infectious disease caused by Corona Virus in the State and vide notification dated 14th March, 2020, the Maharashtra COVID-19 Measures Rules, 2020 have been issued and the lockdown in the State has been extended by issuing orders from time to time. Therefore, it was not possible to hold the annual general meeting of the cooperative societies within the prescribed time frame in the Act in view of social distancing; whereas, Section 75 of the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960 provides that every society shall convene an annual meeting of its members within a period of six months after the end of the financial year to complete its audit and conduct its business within a period of four months from the end of the financial year. However, since it was not possible for the institutions to hold the Annual General Meeting due to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, it was decided to amend the said Article. The Act was published in the Gazette dated December 28, 2020. Accordingly, the Annual General Meeting was held. The extension has been extended till March 31, 2021; therefore, various cooperative societies of the state have sought permission from the Commissioner and Registrar of Cooperatives and other local bodies and authorities to hold the Annual General Meeting for the financial year 2019-20.
Also, the guidelines issued by the government from time to time due to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic still prohibit the gathering of more than 50 people, which has led to confusion among all cooperative societies in the state about how to hold the annual general meeting. Considering this fact, read on. As per the letter, guidelines have been issued to all urban cooperative banks and co-operative housing societies with less than 250 members in the state to hold annual general meetings through VC/ OAVM.
Therefore, read on. (1) All co-operative societies other than those to which guidelines for holding Annual General Meeting have been issued under this letter,
