The Proposal:
According to the Drought Management Code 2016, a detailed procedure has been prescribed under the relevant Government Decision No. 1 and 2 to assess the drought situation in the district. There is no question of declaring drought in Ulhasnagar taluka as the sowing area in Ulhasnagar taluka is different from the 7 taluks where the second wave of drought has hit. In the remaining 6 taluks, the actual crop loss survey has been conducted and based on the proposal received from the State Level Drought Monitoring Committee, the Government has issued instructions under Government Decision No. 5 to declare drought and apply concessions in the taluks of the state. The relief measures announced in the said Government decision include reliefs/ measures related to the cooperative sector such as 1) restructuring of cooperative loans and 2) moratorium on recovery of farm loans.
The standing crops in the state have also been damaged due to heavy rains during the Kharif 2020 season. Currently, the loan recovery season is going on and if the loan is recovered in this season, the farmers are likely to be in trouble. In view of this, the matter of deferring the recovery of loans was under consideration of the government.
The matter of restructuring of cooperative loans and implementing moratorium concessions/ measures for recovery of farm loans in accordance with the Government decision in the above No. 5 of the Revenue and Forest Department was under consideration of the Government.
Government circular:
Directives have been issued to declare drought in the taluks of the state through the Revenue and Forest Department (Relief and Rehabilitation) during the Kharif season of 2020 and to implement measures and concessions in the drought-hit areas.
