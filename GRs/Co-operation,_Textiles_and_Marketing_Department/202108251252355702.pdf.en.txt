Introduction: In 2016-17, due to favorable weather and satisfactory monsoon rains, the state had a large production of tur. 4 lakh under the Price Stabilisation Fund of the Central Government. Even after purchasing tonnes of tur, there was a huge quantity of registered tur left at the purchase centre of the guarantor brother. Considering the low market price received by the farmers due to the abundant production of tur in the state, the government had decided to purchase tur under the Market Intervention Scheme, dated 27.4.2017, to help the farmers. Panan Federation was appointed as the agent agency to implement the scheme. Since this is the first time such a scheme is being implemented in the state, there was no budgetary allocation for the expenditure incurred for this scheme. For this purpose, Government Guarantee has been sanctioned from time to time by the Department of Finance for implementation of the scheme (mainly for payment of dues to farmers and for meeting incidental expenses) as under: (Rs. in the category)
