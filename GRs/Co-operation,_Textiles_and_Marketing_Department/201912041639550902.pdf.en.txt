Under this policy, various subsidy schemes such as interest subvention, capital subsidy and power subsidy have been implemented for textile projects. Textile projects and banks financing them submit online applications to the government for receiving grants under these schemes. Based on the information provided, grants are awarded. However, in the case of some of the projects applied in this manner, it has come to the notice of the Government that some of the textile projects have applied for seeking subsidy while being ineligible. Considering the fact that such wrong information was being submitted to the government through banks and projects, the government was considering the formation of a vigilance and control team to thoroughly examine the quality of projects under the capital subsidy, interest subsidy and electricity subsidy under the textile policy. Accordingly, the government has taken the following steps:
