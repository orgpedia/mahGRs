The Government of Maharashtra
Department of Co-operation, Marketing and Textiles
GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: SAKIRN-2019/ (P.S. 70/2019)/ 9-C
Hutatma Rajguru Chowk, Madam Cama Road
Ministry Extension, Mumbai- 400032
Date: 19th of October 2019
Preamble: The annual instalment of loan and interest on loan to be paid to National Cooperative Development Corporation for all the three wards of Cooperative Marketing and Textile Department was being made from the same scheme of repayment of loans (6003 0242)-56 and interest on loan (2049 1043)-45 interest from National Cooperative Development Corporation respectively. It will be more convenient for the Department to have separate head of accounts for both the purposes of loans from National Cooperative Development Corporation and interest on loans from National Cooperative Development Corporation (NCDC). So that it will be easier for the ward to submit the information regarding actual collection to the finance department, to distribute the funds and the ward-wise provisions under the separate head of accounts will be budgeted in the same proportion and the provision that is returned every year will also be adjusted after the accurate estimates are submitted due to the separate head of accounts. For this, the government was considering to take a new chapter-wise (Marketing and Textile) head from 2020-21.
Government Decision: Approvals are being given to the Textile Division to open new head of accounts for both the purpose of loans and interest on loans from the National Cooperative Development Corporation as follows.
