The proposal-
The cooperative movement has a big role in the economic progress of Maharashtra. But in the last few years, the process of registration of new cooperative societies and starting new projects of these societies has been very slow. In the wake of globalization, privatization and liberalization, cooperatives need to implement some projects through cooperation considering their objectives and the need to meet the challenges of the times accordingly, so that the chain of intermediaries between the farmer members/ economically weaker sections to the consumers is reduced. Alternatively, it can be a cost-effective and direct transaction between the producer and the consumer.
At present, the process of empowering 5000 different executive service cooperatives under the Atal Mahapan Vikas Abhiyan is underway in the state since 2016. Apart from various functional cooperatives, marketing, processing, service and other types of cooperatives are also required to carry out business oriented projects. As envisaged in the Vision 2030 and in the Union Government's Strategy for New India@ 75, the objectives of the Agriculture Sector are to generate direct and indirect employment alternatively by operationalizing the business/ projects of cooperative societies in the State.
For cooperatives, it is necessary to start a new scheme.
The Maharashtra Cooperative Development Corporation, which is working for the development of cooperatives in Maharashtra, has submitted a draft of the scheme to the government to promote the professionalism of such cooperatives. Based on this, the state government was considering to launch a scheme to promote agriculture and agro-supplementary industries of cooperative societies, which would help in rural development.
