The silk industry is an industry with huge employment potential based on agriculture and forest wealth.

There is a huge demand for silk at the regional level in view of the high and regular income from silk farming. Keeping this in mind, the Integrated and Sustainable Textile Policy 2023-28 aims to take a number of measures to bring the silk industry at the centre of the state's economy during the textile policy period. Accordingly, the Textile Policy states that the Maharesheem Abhiyan will be implemented every year in collaboration with Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Research and Training Institute (BARTI), Pune and other institutions to register farmers for new mulberry cultivation and tussar industry. Further, in response to the demand received from the field level, the Planning Department Government has decided to implement the Silk Development Scheme under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme through the Directorate of Sericulture along with the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Rural Development. It will be approved on September 6, 2023. Therefore, to spread information about the silk farming industry and scheme to the farmers and entrepreneurs and to create awareness.
