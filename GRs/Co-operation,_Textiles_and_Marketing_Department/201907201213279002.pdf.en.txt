2. The post of Horticulture Development Officer is included in the cadre of Assistant Manager.
The board proposed to do so. The proposal, however, did not specify the number of posts in the promotion quota for the post of" assistant manager" and the" senior" post from which the promotion was to be given.
Considering the fact that the sanctioned number of posts of' Assistant' would have remained the same, the proposal of the Board was accepted
