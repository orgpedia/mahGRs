| The project cost of cooperative lift irrigation schemes in the state has been continuously increasing in the last few years               |
| This is not only for small and marginal farmers but also for medium and large farmers.                                                    |
| Increasing project costs have become a financial burden.                                                                                  |
| Irrigation schemes are taken up without any cost to the farmers in the beneficiary areas of those schemes                                 |
| Water supply was available, but the farmers in other areas had to arrange for their own irrigation.                                       |
| If they decide to do so, they have to bear the entire cost of their plans themselves.                                                     |
| The government has reduced the expenditure on irrigation projects to some extent by reducing the burden on the beneficiary members.       |
| In view of the above Government Decision dated 19.11.1994, the said Government                                                            |
