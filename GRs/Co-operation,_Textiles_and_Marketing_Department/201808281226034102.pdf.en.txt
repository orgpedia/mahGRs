Ministry (Extension), Mumbai 400 032.
Date is August 28, 2018.
Government Resolution, Cooperation, Marketing and Textiles Department No: Policy 2017/ No.6/ Tex-5, dated 15th February, 2018.
Textiles Policy 2018-23. The decision was announced on February 15, 2018. According to the policy, the scheme of government share for cooperative yarn mills will be implemented only in cotton growing districts. The scheme will be implemented only in the taluks where less than 50% of the cotton produced is used for spinning.
Generally, a cooperative spinning mill with a full capacity of 25200 bales requires at least 28,800 bales (1 bale is 170 kg of cotton) per annum. 28800 bales of cotton is normally 4896 tons of cotton which means the yarn mill needs at least 4896 tons of cotton annually. Considering the fact that the availability of cotton at least 9600 tonnes is required to make the new yarn mill successful, the government is considering declaring the cotton producing taluks in the state.
Government Decision: Considering the fact that at least 4800 tonnes of cotton production is required annually to set up a cooperative spinning mill in a taluk, the talukas which are producing at least 9600 tonnes of cotton annually are henceforth being declared as" Cotton Producing Taluks" for the efficient running of the cooperative spinning mills to be set up in future. Below is the list of districts:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
