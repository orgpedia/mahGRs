Mantralaya, Mumbai 400 032
Dated - 2nd June 2023
Introduction Textile and Apparel industry has witnessed panoramic changes for decades and is now
going through another paradigm shift in terms of automation in manufacturing technologies
and processes. India is a world leader in textiles from fiber to apparel and has a very promising
value chain in place in respect to the changing processes and technologies. Textile Industry
plays an important role in the national economy owing to its major contribution to GDP,
industrial production, employment, and exports. The country is the world's second-largest
producer of textiles and garments and the fifth-largest exporter of textiles spanning apparel,
home and technical products. The textiles and apparel industry contribute 2.3% to the country's
GDP, 13% to industrial production and 12% to exports. The textile industry is one of the largest
sources of employment generation in the country with an estimated 45 million people directly
engaged in this sector including women and rural population.
2. Government of India is implementing various schemes catering exclusively for
promotion and development of textile sector on pan-India basis viz the Production Linked
Incentives Scheme, Amended Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme (A-TUFS), Schemes for
the development of the Powerloom Sector (Power-Tex), Scheme for Integrated Textile Parks
(SITP), SAMARTH- The Scheme for Capacity Building in Textile Sector, Jute (ICARE
Improved Cultivation and Advanced Retting Exercise), Integrated Processing Development
Scheme (IPDS), Silk Samagra, National Handloom Development Programme, National
Handicraft Development Programme, Integrated Wool Development Programme (IWDP) etc.
3. Technical textiles, a sunrise sector, accounts for approximately 13% of India’s total
textile and apparel market, contributing 0.7% to India's GDP and supporting vast array of other
industries. The global growth rate of the technical textile will increase at approximately 4.9%
from 2022-2030. The Indian market is brimming with remarkable opportunities in technical
textiles and various schemes and initiatives such as National Technical Textile Mission and
Production Linked Incentives (PLI) are emphasizing extensively on the importance of technical
textiles in boosting the economy.
4. Maharashtra comprises a significant chapter in the remarkable growth story of India as
a textile's powerhouse. The textile sector plays a crucial role in the state's economy, being the
second-largest employment enabler in Maharashtra, after agriculture. The State accounts for
10.4% of the country's total textile and apparel production and 10.2% of the total employment
# Page 2
Government Resolution No.: Policy 2023/C.R. 81/Tex-5
in this sector. Additionally, the State produces 272 million kilograms of yarn, which is 12% of
India's gross production.
5. The state has efficient rail, road, port and airport infrastructure for connectivity,
availability of electricity, skilled manpower and abundant cotton. The policy aims to strengthen
the entire textile value chain including cotton, wool, silk, handloom, technical textile, non
convention yarn and synthetic yarn. The policy aims to strengthen the supply chain with focus
on how processes can be made more sustainable in a long-term perspective. It lays greater
emphasis on research and skill development and encourages women empowerment. Under this
policy, the State will collaborate with leading technical institutes in the textile sector to
undertake world class research & development projects. The State has set an objective of
achieving 80% in house processing of its cotton production. Maharashtra is also a leader in
non-traditional silk production in the country and excels in production of tasar and mulberry
silk. The traditional textile sector of the state is well recognized, and its products have a place
of prominence in the national and international market.
6. To enhance the growth of the State Textile Industry and to provide handholding
support to the Textile Industry with necessary interventions, the Government of Maharashtra
released the "Textile Policy 2018-2023” during the year 2018. The policy laid special focus on
development of the textile industry in cotton growing areas. Boasting a world-class
infrastructure for procurement, storage and processing, the state increased its processing
capacity of cotton and increased mulberry and tasar cultivation. The Textile Policy 2018-2023
ended on 31st March 2023 and has been given extension till announcement of the new policy.
The textile industry in Maharashtra needs to evolve and capture new and emerging
opportunities in this rapidly changing global business environment. Therefore, the State is
coming up with an Integrated and Sustainable Textile Policy for a period of 5 years. The
proposal for approval of the Integrated and Sustainable Textile Policy 2023-28 was tabled in
the Cabinet meeting on 30 May 2023 and as per the approval, the Government Resolution is
being issued.

7.7 Sericulture Maharashtra is a non-traditional silk producing state that produces both Mulberry and
Tasar Silks. It occupies 1st position in silk production among non-traditional states and 13th
position among 29 silk producing states. Being agricultural activity, at present 12,809 farmers
are involved in silk production through mulberry plantation in about 13,582 acres of land.
Similarly, 853 farmers are involved in Tasar plantation covering 3963 Ha of land.
27 districts have mulberry plantation, and 4 districts have Tasar plantation. Therefore,
a total of 31 districts are involved in silk production. Districts of Aurangabad and Pune
divisions stand out significantly among all sericulture districts as far as mulberry silk is
concerned. Whereas Tasar silk is principally grown in four districts of Vidarbha region namely
Gondia, Gadchiroli, Bhandara and Chandrapur. Maharashtra is among the prominent states
among the non-traditional sericulture states and sericulture is emerging as a prominent industry
amongst farmers. The State has huge sericulture prospects with suitable soil and environmental
condition in the state. Efforts will be made to increase the production of silk cocoons and silk
yarn.
Incentives and Measures:
The following incentives will be provided to the sericulture farmers to produce and
promote silk production and tap the growing market demand.
