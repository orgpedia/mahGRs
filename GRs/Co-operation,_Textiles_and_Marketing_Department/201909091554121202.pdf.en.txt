Government order:
Since the rates of collateral and other incidental costs vary from district to district in the State, the State Nodal Agencies face difficulties in preparing proposals for collateral cost of farm produce purchased on guarantee basis, resulting in late submission of proposals for collateral cost to NAFED. Therefore, in view of the late receipt of collateral cost amounts by the sub-agent entities and the difficulties being faced by them in procuring the same at the base price, the rates of collateral cost are being fixed for procurement at the guarantee price by NAFED under the Minimum Support Price Scheme for Kharif Season 2019 and Rabi Season 2020 as under:
