As per the provisions of Section 73C of the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960, the responsibility of superintendence, conduct and control of elections to the cooperative societies in the state is entrusted to the State Cooperative Election Authority. Accordingly, at present, the elections to the co-operative societies in the State are being processed by the State Co-operative Election Authority; and whereas, in accordance with Section 73AA of the Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act, 1960, the Government is empowered to postpone the elections to any institution or class of institutions for a period not exceeding six months at a time, by general or special order, on the ground that scarcity, drought, flood, fire, and any other natural calamity or monsoon or assembly election schedule falling during the period of election to any institution or class of institutions, in the opinion of the State Government, would not be in the public interest; and whereas, the Election Commission of India has announced the schedule for the elections to the Legislative Assembly of Maharashtra. Since the Model Code of Conduct has come into force from 21/09/2019, the Government is convinced that it is necessary to postpone the elections to the Co-operative Societies in the State for some time as per the provision of Section 73AA of the Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act, 1960; and therefore, under the second proviso to Sub-Section 11 of Section 73 CA, the Housing Co-operative Societies are empowered to hold elections to their Committees. However, it will take some time to finalise the rules. Committee of Housing Co-operative Societies having less than 250 members vide order dated 7th September, 2019
