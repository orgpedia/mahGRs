the prelude
The State Textile Policy 2018-23 has been released as per the Government Decision 15.2.2018. In this policy, the government has decided to promote silk farming and the ancillary industry based on it. The silk industry is an industry with huge potential for employment based on agriculture and forest wealth. The climate of the state is conducive for silk farming. The silk industry is proving to be a boon for the farmers of the state in order to avoid the damage caused by the vagaries of the environment and to get regular income. Silk farming and industries have the potential to provide sustainable income to the farmers. Several schemes are being implemented by the central and state governments for the development of the rural areas. Considering the scope of employment generation in the silk industry, the government was considering the creation and strengthening of infrastructure for the growth of sericulture and silk industry in the state to bring the silk industry to the center of the state's economy.
Government Decision An amount of Rs. 1.00 crore has been earmarked under the Department of Textiles for the financial year 2018-19 for strengthening the existing facilities and creating necessary infrastructure to increase the sources of sustainable income by stabilizing the sericulture in the State and building a silk industry on its basis. Accordingly, the Government has decided to strengthen and create necessary infrastructure for sericulture and setting up of processing industries based on silk products.
After the administrative approval of the scheme as above, the proposal will be sent to the Accountant General for approval of the Planning and Finance Department to open a new head of account for the budgetary provision.
