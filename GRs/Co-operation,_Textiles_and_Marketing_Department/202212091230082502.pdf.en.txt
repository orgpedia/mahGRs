GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: SASAKA-2022/ PR No. 90/3 C
Ministry (Extension) Room No. 602, Madame Cama Road,
Hutatma Rajguru Chowk, Mumbai- 400032
Date: December 9, 2022
Reference:- Letter from the Commissioner of Sugar, Pune, S.A./ Earth 7/ S.A. A 1019/2022, Dy. 12.10.2022
The Proposal:
A total of 100 cooperative sugar mills are operating in the state and there are about equal number of private sugar mills. In the crushing season 2021-22, 101 cooperative and 99 private sugar mills have desilted. Out of the total cooperative sugar factories, 15 factories were set up in May 2020. Tons per day is the filtration capacity and the rest of the factories are having filtration capacity of 2500, 5000, 7500, 10000, 12000 to 16000. In the year 1250. Because of the very low filtration capacity of tons per day, the amount of sugar, molasses and other by-products produced by such a factory is less than that of other factories. Also, the production cost is high. In the course of running such factories, the excess of old machinery workers in the factory, the expense of insufficient working capital, the high interest to be paid on the loans taken and other such reasons led to the closure of the factory in May 1250. Factories with a filtration capacity of tons per day have not been economically viable for many years.
Most of the factories in the state have been expanded and are not financially viable. Tons per day filtration capacity of factories could not be expanded. Considering all these things, the state of May 1250. Factories with a capacity of tons per day
At least 2500 m.c. by modernization and expansion. If some of the cost of increasing the filtration capacity to the tune of tonnes per day is met by the government on a share basis, it will help such factories to become financially viable.
