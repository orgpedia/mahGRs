Introduction: The Agriculture Export Policy announced by the Central Government has set a target to double the export of agricultural products in the country. To meet the objectives of this agricultural export policy, the state government has prepared its own export policy. It has been decided to constitute" State Level Steering Committee" under the Chairmanship of Chief Secretary and" Cluster wise Cluster Facilitation Cell" under the Chairmanship of District Collector of the district having highest production of the concerned agricultural produce to work at the cluster level. 1 decision has been taken by the government. However, at the time of issuing this decision, it was not clear which district should be headed by which collector in the case of which agricultural produce, as the district-wise production data of agricultural produce was not available. Now the Agricultural Marketing Board has provided the district-wise agricultural produce and the Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries Development has provided the information about meat, dairy and dairy products. Accordingly, the government was considering the formation of cluster facilitation cells in the agricultural produce producing districts and keeping in mind that there should be a committee at the level of each district.
Government's decision:
As per the report submitted by the Gathit Committee for the implementation of the State's Agriculture Export Policy, the government is approving the formation of" Cluster-wise Cluster Facilitation Cell" under the chairmanship of the District Collector for each cluster to work at the level of these clusters by forming agricultural clusters.
