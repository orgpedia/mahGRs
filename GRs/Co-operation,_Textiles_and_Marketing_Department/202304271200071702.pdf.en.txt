Preamble: For effective recovery of unpaid loans of urban cooperative banks in the state, the government has earlier approved the implementation of a one-time loan repayment scheme as recommended to the government by the Commissioner and Registrar of Cooperative Societies, Maharashtra State, Pune.
Several urban cooperative banks had sought an extension of the one-time loan repayment scheme. Periodic extension of the one-time loan repayment scheme has so far helped in reducing the mounting NPAs of urban cooperative banks. Keeping this in mind, the proposal to extend the one-time loan repayment scheme for urban cooperative banks was under the consideration of the government.
