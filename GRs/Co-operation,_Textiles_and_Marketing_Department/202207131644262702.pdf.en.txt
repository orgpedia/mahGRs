Introduction: The three-tier cooperative credit structure plays an important role in providing agricultural credit to the farmers of the state. These include the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank at the state level, district central cooperative banks at the district level and primary agricultural credit cooperative societies at the village level. As on 31/03/2021, a total of 31 District Central Cooperative Banks and 20,986 Primary Agricultural Credit Cooperative Societies are functioning in the State.
As an initiative of NABARD, CBS computer system has been made operational in all 31 District Central Cooperative Banks in the State. Through this system, all types of banking facilities are being made available to all the customers of District Central Cooperative Banks on the basis of modern technology. However, most of the Primary Agricultural Credit Co-operative Societies affiliated to District Central Co-operative Banks are still out of the purview of such computerized technical facilities.
Primary Agricultural Credit Co-operative Societies (PACS) are primarily involving farmers and rural artisans and their main objective is to promote savings and mutual assistance among the members, to meet their credit needs, to provide credit linked inputs, storage and marketing facilities for farm produce. The need has arisen for these organizations to provide various services to their members based on computer technology and make them viable business enterprises. Keeping this in mind, the Central Government has approved the project titled" Computerization of Centrally Sponsored Primary Agricultural Credit Cooperative Societies" on 29 th June, 2022 to make Primary Agricultural Credit Cooperative Societies in the country self-reliant on the lines of" Atmanirbhar Bharat" mission. The implementation, guidance and direction of the project will be done by NABARD under the control of Ministry of Cooperation, Government of India. The project will be implemented over a period of five years from 2022-23 to 2026-27.
As per the guidelines issued by the central government, the implementation and control committee at the state and district level was under consideration.
