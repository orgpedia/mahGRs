The Proposal:
The scheme of loans to cooperative housing societies of state government and zilla parishad employees has been started by the Finance Department since 1967. In 1980, it was transferred to the then Department of Agriculture and Cooperation and since 1984, it is being implemented by the Department of Cooperation, Marketing and Textiles.
Under this scheme, loans have been disbursed to hundreds of co-operative societies of government and zilla parishad employees across Maharashtra. However, the construction of their houses is yet to be completed as the institutions that sanctioned the loan in 2007 and paid the first instalment have not been disbursed the full loan.
The promoter is required to register the project under Section 4 (1) and 4 (2) of the Maharashtra Real Estate (Regulation and Development) (Registration of Real Estate Projects, Registration of Real Estate Agents, Interest Rates and their Disclosure on Websites) Rules, 2017. However, loans have been given to cooperative housing societies of state government employees and zilla parishad employees under the group insurance scheme. Therefore, the members together buy the land and construct the houses on it themselves or from the contractors/ labourers, they do not buy the houses from the developers. Therefore, while registering the allotment agreement/ consent agreement of the members of this organization, the concerned demand the MahaRERA registration number. Some of the cooperative housing societies under the scheme had also sought relaxation of the condition that banks/ other financial institutions do not grant loans to members without a MahaRERA registration number. Considering this, the government was considering relaxing the condition of registering these housing societies under the MahaRERA Act.
Circular:
The members of the cooperative housing societies of state government employees and zilla parishad employees, who have been sanctioned loans for construction of houses under the group insurance scheme of the state government but have not disbursed 100% loans, are completing the construction of their own houses through contractors/ labourers. Also, there is no saleable component available in the projects of these housing societies. Similarly, the flats in this housing society are in the open market.
