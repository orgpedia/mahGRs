This has been discussed in the meeting held on 27.12.2019 in the auditorium of Maharashtra State Co-operative Bank, Mumbai. However, the possibility of some District Central Co-operative Banks, as well as Primary Agricultural Credit Societies/ Development Agencies levying interest on loan accounts at their level cannot be ruled out. This is hampering the basic objective of the scheme to reduce the debt of the farmers.
Therefore, in view of the above, in order to ensure that the accounts of all the farmers under the scheme are de-linked and new farm loans are made available to them, there should be uniformity in the action of not charging interest on the loan accounts of the beneficiaries under the scheme at the level of commercial banks and district central cooperative banks and various executive service cooperative societies with effect from 1.10.2019 till the actual benefit is received under the scheme.
Accordingly, the District Central Cooperative Banks and various Executive Service Cooperative Societies have provided loans under the Debt Waiver Scheme. It has become necessary in the public interest to issue instructions to all concerned under section 79A of the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960 that interest should not be charged on the amount of eligible outstanding short term crop loan as well as short term crop loan, which has been converted into medium term loan by restructuring/ restructuring, from 1.10.2019 till the actual benefit of the scheme is received.
Accordingly, in the public interest, the Government, under the authority of Section 79A of the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960, hereby directs all the District Central Cooperative Banks and various Executive Service Cooperative Societies in the State to:
the order
The interest shall not be charged by the District Central Co-operative Banks and various Executive Service Co-operative Societies on the outstanding amount in the loan account of eligible beneficiaries as per the scheme norms from 1.10.2019 till the actual benefit of the scheme is received on the loan account of farmers eligible for the Mahatma Jotirao Phule Farmers Debt Waiver Scheme 2019.
