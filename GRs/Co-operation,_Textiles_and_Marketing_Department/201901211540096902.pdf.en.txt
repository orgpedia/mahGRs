As per the original proposal, the total area of the institute would be 4, 214.91 sq ft for a total of 57 members. I am so much and there are a total of 60 plots of the institution available on it. A proposal seeking loans from 57 members of the society has been submitted to the government. Thus, the organization has created 4,019 posts for 57 members. I built in the area. 195 respectively. I'm building the area. As there was no possibility of sanctioning loans in future for the un-constructed area, the proposal of the institute to allow transfer/ sale of the remaining area by freeing it from mortgage was under consideration of the government. As per the report dated 18/03/2016 of the District Sub-Registrar, Cooperative Societies, District Ahmednagar, it has been certified that there is no objection to exclude the area from the mortgage as the construction has not been done on the plot numbers 72, 82 and 110 and the government is giving the following decision.
