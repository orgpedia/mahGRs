Preamble: Due to increase in area and production of sugarcane during the crushing season 2021-22 in the State, additional sugarcane is available than the crushing capacity of sugar mills. Especially in the area of sugar mills in Marathwada, more sugarcane is available than the distillation capacity. Orders for distribution of sugarcane are required to be issued to filter out the excess sugarcane from other factories in the jurisdiction of such factories. In this background, the government was considering the issue of sanctioning sugarcane transportation subsidy and sugarcane crushing subsidy for additional sugarcane to avoid financial loss to farmers and sugar mills.
Government decision: For sugarcane desilted from 1.5.2022 and mandatorily distributed by the Sugar Commissionerate, the transportation cost per tonne per km excluding distance of 50 km is Rs. The sugarcane transportation subsidy as per 5/- is being sanctioned under this Government decision.
2. In order to implement the decision of the Government, the Sugar Commissioner has issued an order for distribution of surplus sugarcane to the nearest sugar mills, keeping in view the scope of surplus sugarcane and the proximity of the factory.
In the proposal for issue and transportation subsidy, the factories should include the name of the sugarcane farmer, the name of the village, the area of sugarcane, the name of the factory in whose jurisdiction the sugarcane is located and the distance of transportation. The Sugar Commissioner's office should ensure that all sugar factories transport sugarcane and distill it as per the prescribed instructions.

In case of sugar mills where the remaining sugarcane has been transported beyond a distance of 50 km, the transport subsidy will be sanctioned only after the sugar commissioner submits a proposal to the government confirming the distance between the sugar factory and the area of the sugarcane farmer.
Considering the availability of sugarcane in the current year in Maharashtra, about 52 lakh tonnes of sugarcane is left to be desilted. If the sugar mills are closed, the farmers will be left with sugarcane and the question of compensation may arise before the government. Keeping this in mind, the remaining sugarcane of the farmers should be allowed to be sown. For all remaining sugarcane of farmers to be transplanted after 1.5.2022, Rs. It has been decided to provide subsidy to the concerned factories at the rate of Rs.200/- per tonne.
4. Proposed Government Decision to be taken by the State Cabinet. As per the decision taken in the meeting dated 28.4.2022 and as per the Informal Reference No. 304/2022/ Expenditure-2, Sec. is being issued pursuant to the Consent received vide 25.5.2022.
