Presently, there are 7 Regional Divisions in the State namely Pune, Kolhapur, Nanded, Amravati, Aurangabad, Ahmednagar and Nagpur under the Sugar Commissioner. There are a total of 68 cooperative and private sugar mills in the Pune regional division. Out of these, there are 37 sugar mills in Solapur district. In addition, work on 8 private sugar mills is in progress. The representative of all these factories have to go to the Regional Joint Director (Sugar), Pune for office work from time to time. Solapur district accounts for 20.59 per cent of the total sugarcane silt in Maharashtra. The office of Regional Joint Director (Sugar), Pune is getting more and more work due to the large number of sugar mills in the Pune Regional Division. Therefore, the sanctioned staff in this office is very inadequate. Therefore, considering the number of sugar mills in Solapur district alone and the amount of sugarcane crushing, the government was considering to set up a separate regional office of Regional Joint Director (Sugar), Solapur.
Government Decision: Considering the number of sugar mills in Solapur district and the amount of sugarcane crushing, subject to the condition of dedicating the 386 posts under consideration under the review of posts of the Cooperative Marketing and Textile Department and considering the financial savings, the Government is approving the opening of a new Regional Office of the Independent Regional Joint Director (Sugar), Solapur. The Establishment (5-C) Office should take care of dedicating the 386 posts under consideration under the review of the posts of the department. For the newly created Regional Joint Director (Sugar), Solapur, the following 8 posts are being sanctioned subject to the above mentioned condition with the approval of the High Level Committee of Secretaries.
