Ministry (s. Mumbai- 400032
Date: December 28, 2023.
Reference: 1) Government Circular, Cooperation, Marketing and Textiles Department, No. Training- 1014/ Q.No. 23/22-S, dated 10th September, 2014.
2) Letter from the Commissioner of Cooperation and Registrar Cooperative Societies, Pune. 24 (A)/ 2023/223 dated 5.10.2023.
Section 24-A of the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960 provides that every institution shall conduct cooperative education and training for its directors, members, officers and employees through the State Federal Institutions or State Apex Training Institutions as may be specified by the State Government by notification in the Official Gazette. As per the Economic Survey 2020-21 of Maharashtra, as on 31st March, 2021, there are about 2.17 lakh cooperative societies in the state with a total membership of about 5.75 crore. The number of directors of these institutions is more than 25 lakh and the number of employees is about 3.5 lakh.
As per Section 24A of the Co-operative Act, it is mandatory for a co-operative society to impart co-operative education and training to its directors, members and officers/ employees.
In view of the above, Reference No. 1 The circular here lays down the criteria for recognition of cooperative training institutions as State Apex Training Institutions. As per Section 24-A of the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960, some institutions in the state have been notified as State Apex Training Institutes. However, in view of the large number of members of cooperative societies in the state and the obligation to provide training to these members at least once in 5 years, it is still necessary to notify some institutions as training institutions. Accordingly, a proposal to notify the Maharashtra Cooperative Development Corporation Ltd., Pune as State Apex Training Institute under Section 24-A of the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960 was under consideration of the Government.
In this regard, the Government has taken the following decision in pursuance of the proposal submitted by the Cooperation Commissioner and Registrar, Cooperative Societies, Maharashtra State, Pune under the reference letter to be notified as State Apex Training Institute for Cooperative Education and Training as per Section 24-A of the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960.
