Government Resolution No. KRIKAMA 1219/ Q.No. 157/2-S, dated 27.12.2019
There are 153 lakh farmers in the state who take loans from commercial banks and district central cooperative banks for farming and allied activities. For four consecutive years, from 2015-16 to 2018-19, a huge amount of less than 50 paise was released due to drought-like situation in various parts of the state. Meanwhile, farmers in several parts of the state have been affected by the unseasonal rains.
Due to the loss of farmers in the wake of this natural disaster, agricultural loans could not be repaid on time in the last few years. As a result, the farmers are in debt and are unable to get loans for their crops.
Considering the above situation, the government had announced the Mahatma Jotirao Phule Farmers Debt Waiver Scheme in the Winter Session 2019. Accordingly, a Government Resolution dated 27.12.2019 has been issued in this regard.
Under the Mahatma Jotirao Phule Farmers' Debt Waiver Scheme 2019, farmers who repay their short-term crop loans regularly will be given Rs. In the budget session of 2020, it was announced to provide incentive benefits up to Rs 50,000. However, the promise could not be fulfilled due to the economic crisis in the state in the wake of COVID-19 that has been sweeping the country since March 2020.
Thereafter, in the Budget Session 2022, farmers who repay their short-term crop loans regularly will be given Rs. Budget provision was announced for the financial year 2022-23 to provide incentive benefits up to Rs 50,000. Accordingly, farmers who have fully repaid their short term crop loans will get a maximum of Rs. The government had promised to provide financial assistance of Rs 50 lakh.

This has been approved in the Cabinet meeting held on 27.07.2022. Accordingly, the government is approving a scheme to provide incentive benefits to fully loan-paying farmers in the state as follows.
