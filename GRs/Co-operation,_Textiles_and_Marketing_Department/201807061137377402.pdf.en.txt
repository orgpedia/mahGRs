Introduction: The Central Government has launched the National Agriculture Market (NAM) scheme based on the concept of one market at the country level for the purchase and sale of agricultural products. Under the e-NAM scheme, 60 market committees of the state have been included in two phases and linked to e-NAM. In the first phase, the e-auction system has been started in 30 market committees and the process is underway to start it in the second phase. Also, the e-auction system is being implemented in 25 market committees under the World Bank-assisted Maharashtra Competitive Agriculture Development Project through the Maharashtra State Agricultural Marketing Board. The e-auction system will bring in greater transparency and rationality in the auction process at the market committee level and help farmers get remunerative prices for their produce. To make the e-auction system more effective, the government was considering implementing it in 145 other market committees in the state.
Government Decision: The Government is approving the proposal to link 145 major market committees of the State on the National Agriculture Market (e-NAM) portal, excluding a total of 85 market committees in the State, which are implementing the Central Government's e-NAM scheme, 60 market committees in the State and 25 market committees that are implementing the e-auction scheme under the World Bank-assisted Maharashtra Competitive Agriculture Development Project.
The Maharashtra Ordinance, 2018. The e-NAM scheme should be implemented in accordance with the following provisions of the Maharashtra Agricultural Produce Marketing (Development and Regulation) Act.
