Government Resolution
The Government of Maharashtra is empowering farmers through export-led production and market-oriented marketing of their agricultural produce. The National Farm Machinery Show (NFMS) 2026, to be held from 11-14 February 2026 at Louisville, Kentucky, USA, is a globally renowned exhibition highlighting advanced agricultural machinery, precision farming, automation, sustainable technologies, and innovations relevant to export-oriented agriculture. The exhibition is highly aligned with the objectives of the Maharashtra State Agricultural Marketing Board (MSAMB), as it provides an opportunity to study international best agricultural practices across the entire value chain - from production and mechanism to post-harvest handling, quality management, packaging, and logistics - critical for agro-commodity exports. Exposure to these global practices and technologies will enable the adoption of export-compliant production systems, support evidence-based policy and investment decisions, and enhance the quality, productivity, and global competitiveness of agricultural commodities from Maharashtra.
The proposed study tour under the leadership of the Hon'ble Minister (Marketing & Protocol), Government of Maharashtra, will facilitate strategic interactions with global manufacturers, experts, and policymakers, enabling international collaboration, pilot projects, and future investments. The visit will also support discussions with relevant stakeholders regarding the opening of the U.S. Market for Indian agro produce, thereby strengthening agricultural exports.
Overall, the tour will play a crucial role in strengthening the agricultural value chain, empowering Farmer Producer Organizations, and promoting adoption of international-standard technologies, contributing to the long-term growth of agriculture and agri-exports from Maharashtra.
Considering above potential benefits, the Government of Maharashtra, through Maharashtra State Agricultural Marketing Board, Pune, has planned a study visit for Shri.
Jaykumar Jitendrasinh Rawal, Minister (Marketing & Protocol), Government of Maharashtra along with the officials to USA from 9TM to 16 "February, 2026, inclusive of travel time.
