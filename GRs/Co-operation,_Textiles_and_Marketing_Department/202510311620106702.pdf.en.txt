The delegation will participate in the WUWM Conference in Brussels and undertake exposure visits to Rungis International Market, Paris, and Royal Flora Holland, Netherlands, to study modern market systems, cold-chain infrastructure, logistics, and customer-centric services.

sustainability-linked practices for strengthening wholesale markets, along with opportunities for global
networking among wholesalers, retailers, policymakers, and agri-food experts.
