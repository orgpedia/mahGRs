Details of 27th Meeting of State Level Project Approval Committee of National Agriculture Development Scheme vide G.O. No. RKV0519/ CR. 143/14-A, Dt. July 18, 2019.
Introduction: As per the guidelines issued by the Central Government under the National Agriculture Development Scheme, Ma. Chief Secretary, Government of Maharashtra. The State Level Project Sanctioning Committee (SLSC) has been constituted vide Government Resolution dated 20th September, 2007. It took place on July 4, 2019.
In this meeting, a proposal was presented to upgrade the godowns in Vidarbha and Marathwada divisions through the Maharashtra State Warehousing Corporation. The Maharashtra State Warehousing Corporation has been implementing the programme of setting up warehouses for storage of agricultural produce since 1957. Till date, the Warehousing Corporation has collected Rs. 17.91 lakh. Tonne warehouse capacity has been created.
By upgrading the facilities of godowns in Vidarbha and Marathwada regions, it will benefit mainly the farmers for storing food grains. For this, the Warehousing Corporation has taken up the upgradation of warehouses at warehouses in Vidarbha and Marathwada regions by constructing safety walls, concretizing internal roads, constructing apron gutters and shelter sheds for farmers and porters. By creating such facilities, the godowns can be used for storage at full capacity for the farmers. Therefore, e-fare receipt, NCDEX etc. can be made available at such warehouses. This will enable the farmers to avail of crop loans.
Also, since there are mud or gravel roads in the warehouse complex, it is stored in the warehouse.

A large amount of dust accumulates on the food grains. This dust is mixed in large quantity in food grains from linen bags. Also, during rainy season, the roads inside the warehouses complex are not motorable as the road surface is not as per the standards, as a result, the benefit of the warehouse space is not being passed on to the farmers/ hoarders.
Considering this, it is necessary to concretize the roads in the warehouses complex and build a protective wall on all sides for the safety of the warehouses.
However, considering the limited sources of production and available funds, it is not possible for the Maharashtra State Warehousing Corporation to implement a combined programme for the upgradation of warehouses in Vidarbha and Marathwada regions. An amount of Rs. 65.92 crore has been sanctioned. The project cost is Rs. 65.92 crore from the Maharashtra State Warehousing Corporation. 16.15 crore and Rs. 49.77 crore. Administrative and financial approval for the project was under consideration at the government level. Following this, the government decided:
