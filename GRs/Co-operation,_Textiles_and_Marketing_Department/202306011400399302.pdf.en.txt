Government circular
The government has issued instructions from time to time to handle court cases in a time-bound and priority manner. Also, the government has issued instructions to appoint a controlling/ coordinating officer in each office to control the court cases.
However, recently, the office of the Director of Marketing, Maharashtra State, Pune, in an important court case, issued a notice to Mr. The court's order did not come within the stipulated time. The court expressed its dissatisfaction. Similarly, in many cases, the government's side is not being represented properly due to the absence of responsible and informed officers from the office of the Pay Commission/ concerned District Sub-Registrar Cooperative Societies during the hearing of court cases. Therefore, within the stipulated time. The government did not appear before the court.
In some cases, the draft affidavit has been submitted to the government for approval a day before or on the same day. In such a case, the government gets very little time to approve the affidavit after receiving all the information/ documents of the case in a very short time, studying it and considering the information received. Therefore, it is not possible to present the government's side properly in a short period of time and the possibility of judicial decisions going against the government cannot be ruled out. Therefore, all these matters should be taken seriously by the Director of Marketing, State of Maharashtra, Pune and District Deputy Registrar Cooperative Societies (all) and henceforth the court case should be dealt with in a time-bound and prompt manner as follows.
(1) All the District Deputy Registrar Cooperative Societies of the State shall issue an order to the Assistant Registrar Cooperative Societies in their office to appoint a Nodal Officer for the control of court cases in the concerned district and the concerned Assistant Director in the Directorate of Marketing immediately. The Director of Marketing, Maharashtra State Pune shall submit an updated list of district-wise nodal officers to the Government from time to time.
(ii) The Nodal Officer shall prepare an office-wise registry of court cases by adopting the instructions and procedures as per Vacha, dated 7.11.2000 and 31.12.2014.
