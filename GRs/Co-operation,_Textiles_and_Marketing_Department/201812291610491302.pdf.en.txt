Ministry, Mumbai- 400 032.
Date: December 26, 2018
The Maharashtra Civil Services (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1979.
Government Circular: The concerned officer/ employee is arrested after registering a case against him/ her in the Prevention of Corruption Act or other criminal cases. After the arrest, the office of the concerned officer/ employee receives information about the bribery or action taken by the police department, the information about the fixed period of arrest and subsequent arrest of such officer/ employee, the recommendation for suspension of the person if the period of arrest is 48 hours or more, the order issued at the government level regarding the suspension of the gazetted officer as the appointing authority and the suspension order is issued to the concerned officer/ employee.
After receiving such information from the departmental level and the police department and receiving additional information/ reports as required, the officer/ employee arrested in the case of bribery or criminal action until the order of suspension/ civil suspension is issued from the government level as the appointing authority. The government has observed that after getting bail from the court, he immediately returns to his previous post and does his official work.
In fact, having regard to the provisions of Rule 4 (2) of the Maharashtra Civil Services (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1979 as well as Rule 2.2 of the Departmental Inquiry Manual, Fourth Edition, 1991, it is provided that a Government officer/ employee detained under criminal charges or otherwise in police custody or judicial custody for a period exceeding 48 hours shall be deemed to have been placed under suspension by order of the appointing authority from the date of detention. In view of this provision, if the period of arrest is more than 48 hours after the arrest in a bribery or other criminal case, the concerned officer/ employee is automatically suspended from the date of arrest on the said date and all the officers/ employees in the service of the Government of Maharashtra are aware of this self-explanatory provision and are liable to be suspended. It is certainly a case of misconduct of office that after getting bail from the court, he starts his official and legal work by appearing in the previous post.
However, there is no self-explanatory provision in the Maharashtra Civil Services (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1979 and the Departmental Enquiries Rules, 1991, as to what action should be taken against the officers/ employees concerned in such cases.
