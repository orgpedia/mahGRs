Circular:" Chapter XIII-B" has been inserted in the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960 for cooperative housing societies having strength of 250 members or less. While incorporating the said case, section 73 CAB (11) of the Act was amended as follows:
" Provided that the institutions may be classified in such manner as may be prescribed by a general or special order, having regard to the objectives of the Government, the institution, the class of institutions, the standards of the field and profession, and the interests of the members and of the appropriate management. " In pursuance of the said provisions, the Maharashtra Co-operative Societies (Election to Committees) Rules, 2014 issued a notification in the Gazette dated 06.04.2021 for fresh filing of" Part- 10-1 A" for holding elections to the said Co-operative Housing Societies. In accordance with the provisions therein, the process of holding elections to the" E" type of cooperative housing societies was initiated, however, there was no provision in the election rules as to how the election expenses should be assessed. Similarly, complaints were received that the Election Commission was charging exorbitant expenses for the elections to the said Cooperative Housing Societies in the absence of a definite policy of the Government on the assessment of expenditure. Similarly, in the Budget Session of 2022, the issue of expenditure related to elections to cooperative housing societies was raised. In view of this fact, maximum wages/ allowances as mentioned in the table below are being fixed in respect of selection of Co-operative Housing Societies (E type) having strength of 250 or less members.
