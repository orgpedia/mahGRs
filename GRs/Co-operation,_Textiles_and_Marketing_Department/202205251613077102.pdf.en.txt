Out of which 17 candidates were selected for the post of Scribe and 14 for the post of Soldier from the Scheduled Tribe category and they were appointed in the year 2002 03. During the subsequent visit of the Scheduled Tribes Welfare Committee, it was found that the employees appointed from the Scheduled Tribes category had not submitted the caste validity certificate. Out of them, 9 employees belonging to the scribe cadre were re-engaged in service on production of caste validity certificate and Ms. Seema Janardan Murudkar of Special Backward Classes was re-engaged at the point of insurability. It is also observed that 9 personnel of the peon cadre have been re-integrated into the service after they submitted caste validity certificates. A total of 13 candidates, 8 from the leftover scribe cadre and 5 from the sepoy cadre, were dismissed from service under the order dated 28.01.2009 of the Buldana GIMS Bank as their Scheduled Tribe caste certificates were found invalid.
2. Shri Sharad Srihari Thakur, who was dismissed from service against this order, has given his resignation. Writ Petition No. 4629/2013 was filed in the High Court, Bench Nagpur. In this case, The High Court has upheld the validity of Shri Sharad Thakur in the Scheduled Tribe (Thakur) category.
