Urban Co-operative Banks to reduce NPAs
Periodic extension of repayment plan has so far helped in reducing the mounting NPAs of urban cooperative banks. This scheme is for the defaulters of urban cooperative banks.
A proposal to extend the one-time loan repayment scheme for urban cooperative banks was under consideration of the government to improve the balance sheet of banks by closing the outstanding loan accounts by involving them and for the effective implementation of this scheme.
