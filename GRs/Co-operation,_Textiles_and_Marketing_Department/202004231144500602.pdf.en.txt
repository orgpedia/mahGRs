Before drawing the funds available on the budget distribution system from the treasury, in the circular referred to in paragraph no. The guidelines in paragraphs 4 to 13 and the accompanying appendices should be strictly followed. Also, the rules mentioned in the Maharashtra Budget rule book should be followed. No separate approval of the Finance Department is required to be obtained in respect of disbursement of funds under the powers conferred under Part-I, Financial Powers Rules, 2013/ Q. No. 30/2013/ Regulations-Part-II, dated 17.4.2015 or in respect of matters covered under the financial powers conferred under Part-II of the Financial Powers Rules, 2013, from time to time.
However, concurrence of the Finance Department will be required in respect of matters for which financial powers have not been specifically delegated to the departments, other than those mentioned in the aforesaid Government Order.
Subsidiary Grants (Non-salaried):- Before sanctioning the Subsidiary Grants to various Government/ Administrative Institutions and Subsidiary Institutions, the Department should obtain utilization certificates of the expenditure of the grants disbursed earlier. Further grants should not be released unless the utilization of the earlier grant is completed. The treasury officer should not pass the payment if the payment submitted for withdrawal of funds from the auxiliary grant is not accompanied by a copy of the bank account statement of the corresponding institution for the previous month.
Grants to Local Bodies and Corporations:- Before disbursing grants to Local Bodies and Corporations, the amount coming to the State Government from these bodies should be reviewed and the remaining grants should be disbursed only after recovering them. Also, detailed information should be collected about the utilization of grants distributed by the government to these institutions and where the unutilized amount is kept. If the unaccounted money is kept in the bank, its bank account statement should be submitted to the government.
If the funds made available for expenditure on a programme are unutilized, the funds should not be released for the same purpose in the current year without the approval of the Finance Department.
Unexpired Amount:- It is a kind of irregularity that the funds left unspent for various reasons are technically shown as spent by the departments by transferring them to their subordinate corporation. Provisions shall not be drawn or disbursed unless the previous unutilized funds under them (kept outside the purview of their own provident fund account/ corporation account or otherwise showing expenditure) have been fully spent. The funds lying with the department under its own provident fund account should be reconciled and audited and returned to the government treasury if the funds are not spent within the prescribed time. If the unaccounted money is kept in the bank, then its bank account statement should be submitted to the government.
