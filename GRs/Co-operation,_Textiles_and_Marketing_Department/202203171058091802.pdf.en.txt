Mantralaya, Mumbai- 400 032
Date of release: March 17, 2022
The Proposal:
Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank and District Central Cooperative Banks provide term loans to cooperative sugar factories, cooperative refineries and other cooperative societies and other borrowers in the state. Cooperative banks are expected to repay the term loans given to the institutions in a time bound manner. At present, there is an increase in the amount of loans taken by various cooperative societies and other borrowers from banks.
The defaulting co-operative societies and other borrowers are unable to repay their loans to the Maharashtra State Co-operative Bank and District Central Co-operative Bank. As a result, co-operative societies and other creditors are unable to access working capital. Considering all these aspects, the government was considering the formation of a study group to prepare a comprehensive one-time loan repayment scheme for cooperative societies and other borrowers who had taken loans from Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank and District Central Cooperative Banks.
Government's decision:
In view of the above, the Government has decided to constitute a Study Group as follows to prepare an all-encompassing one-time repayment plan for recovery of outstanding loans of Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank and District Central Cooperative Banks.
