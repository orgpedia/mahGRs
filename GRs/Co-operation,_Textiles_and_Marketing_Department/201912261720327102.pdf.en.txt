Preamble: Textile Policy, 2018-23. The decision was announced on February 15, 2018. The silk industry is an industry with huge employment potential based on agriculture and forest wealth. There is a lot of scope for silk production in the state as the climate of Maharashtra is conducive for this industry. It is an industry that helps in raising the economic level and living standards of the people in rural areas along with increasing the agricultural growth rate of the state. However, due to lack of complete knowledge of this industry, the farmers of the state are not seen turning to this industry on a large scale. Keeping this in mind, the Textile Policy 2018-23 aims to take several measures to bring the silk industry at the centre of the state's economy. The Textile Policy states that the MAHARASHIM Abhiyaan will be implemented every year in collaboration with Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Research and Training Institute (BARTI), Pune to register farmers for new mulberry cultivation. The Maharesham Abhiyan-2019 has received an overwhelming response in the state and has helped in making the silk industry people-oriented by promoting and popularizing sericulture. Accordingly, as per the proposal submitted by the Director (Reshim), the Government was contemplating to implement" Mahareshim Abhiyan-2020."
