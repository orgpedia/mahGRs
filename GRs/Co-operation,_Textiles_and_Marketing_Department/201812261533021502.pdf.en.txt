Ministry, Extension, Mumbai-32
Date: 26th of December 2018
Reference:- 1) Cabinet Decision dated Tuesday, 11th December, 2018 2) Cabinet Decision dated Thursday, 20th December, 2018
Introduction: The onion production in the state has been affected due to deficient rainfall this year. Also, due to good onion production in neighbouring states like Karnataka, Gujarat and Rajasthan, the demand for regular onion from North and South India has come down.
As a result, there is not much demand in the market. In the month of November 2018, the prices of onions in the major market committees of the state have suddenly come down, forcing the farmers to sell their onions at a very low price. Newspapers, TV channels and social media were abuzz with reports demanding financial assistance to farmers in distress due to falling prices of onions at the national level.
Similarly, farmers, farmers' organizations and local people's representatives were also demanding relief for onion growers. In this regard, the Cabinet in its meeting held on Tuesday, 11.12.2018 has directed to take measures to support the onion farmers.
Since November, 2018, there has been a huge inflow of Kharif and Rabi season onion in the major market committees of the state. During this period, the market price of onion was generally Rs 250 to Rs 900 per quintal. In the same period last year, the price of onion was Rs 2600-Rs 2700 per quintal. Also, considering the per quintal cost of onion production to the farmers, the government was considering to provide subsidy to the farmers who sold onion in the Agricultural Produce Market Committee of the state from November 1, 2018 to December 15, 2018 in order to provide financial assistance to the onion farmers of the state.
