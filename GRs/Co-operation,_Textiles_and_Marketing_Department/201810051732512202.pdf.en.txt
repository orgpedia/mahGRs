Introduction: The Department of Cooperation, Marketing and Textiles is trying to establish a marketing system for agricultural products in Maharashtra, eliminate middlemen from farmers to consumers, and ensure fair prices for agricultural goods for farmers. The people living in urban areas also need to get the necessary agricultural produce at reasonable prices. The cooperative value under cooperatives can be used by farmers' cooperatives, farmer producer companies, farmers' groups, to provide good agricultural produce at reasonable prices to their members and residents in cooperative housing societies in urban areas. In major cities, efforts are being made to sell agricultural produce in the premises of housing societies through various organizations, farmers groups, self-help groups, etc. However, due to lack of coherence and consistency in this effort, the idea has not been promoted and disseminated enough. Also, the concept of these efforts is not being implemented in tandem and there does not seem to be consistent success.
The Government has been implementing Atal Mahapan Vikas Abhiyan since 25th December, 2016 to empower the State Cooperative Marketing Federation, Buying and Selling Associations, various Executive Cooperative Societies, Farmer Producer Organizations and Women Self Help Groups in the State. As per point 2 (j) of the Government Resolution dated 26.12.2017, the issue of sale of agricultural produce by farmers in rural areas to consumers in urban areas through cooperative marketing and other institutions through cooperative housing societies was under consideration.
Government Decisions: Various types of cooperatives providing agricultural products, dairy products, processed products in rural areas of the state, e.g. The Government is approving to develop a mechanism for providing clean, fresh, quality sourced agri-produce to the consumers in the cooperative housing societies in the urban areas of the State through Procurement Unions, VCCs, Farmers Groups/ Farmer Producer Companies, Women Self Help Groups.
