GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: ASTHAMU-2019/ PR No. 40/1-S
A review of the recovery of financial assistance disbursed to the institutions shows that there has been a meagre recovery. It is observed that these posts created for the audit of agricultural processing cooperatives do not carry out the functions of agricultural processing cooperatives. While allocating the financial assistance to the Agricultural Processing Cooperatives as per the pattern approved by the National Cooperative Development Corporation, the proposal would have been submitted for approval of the Planning and Finance Department to recover the amount of financial assistance from the institutions which have already been given financial assistance and whose institutions have been closed or have become defunct. Also, the Finance and Planning Department has been instructed to submit a report on what is the mechanism for this recovery. Since the loans are not being recovered from the institutions given earlier, this debt is an additional burden on the government. In view of this and as it is observed that the posts created for the audit of the Agricultural Processing Cooperatives have not been allocated properly as per the approved figure of permanent/ temporary posts in the field office, the 32 posts sanctioned for the audit of Agricultural Processing Cooperatives have been allocated for the recovery of the financial assistance given to the Agricultural Processing Cooperatives and for the proper examination of the proposals submitted to the Government. As per the revised office-wise allocation at Taluk/ District/ Division/ Headquarter level as per the Government decision dated 15.04.2019, the total number of vacant posts in Taluk/ District/ Division/ Headquarter level is Rs. 01.03.2019 to D. Orders have been issued to extend the period up to 30.09.2019. Thereafter, reference No. 7 Reference No. 8 As per the decision of the government here, the 32 posts were given as per the previous allocation. The period has been extended up to 31.05.2019. Now, again, reference no. 9 The matter of extending the revised deadline was under consideration of the Government in accordance with the request made under the letter.
Government's decision:
The government has issued orders towards this.
Since the officers/ staff have been given posting as per the earlier order of allotment of sanctioned posts for audit of Agricultural Processing Co-operative Societies and have been enrolled in the system of service accordingly, the salary of the said posts has been increased from Rs. The office of the Cooperation Commissioner and Registrar, Cooperative Societies, M.R. Pune has requested to grant extension as per the earlier allotment of the said posts as it could not be done as per the revised allotment under the Government decision dated 15.04.2019. Reference No. 22.04.2019. 7 is written here. 32 posts created for the audit of Agricultural Processing Cooperatives as per the earlier allocation in order to pass the salary payments of the employees. 01.03.2019 to D. As on 31.05.2019 Reference No. The extension was granted on August 8. Now as shown in the following table. 01.06.2019 to D. Extension up to 30.09.2019 is being granted.
