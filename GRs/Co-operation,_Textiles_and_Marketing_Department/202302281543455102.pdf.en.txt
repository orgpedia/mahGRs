The Government of Maharashtra
Department of Co-operation, Marketing and Textiles
GOVERNMENT DECISION, NO.:- SAPAS-2023/ P.No. 52/24 C
Ministry, Extension, Mumbai-32
Date: February 28, 2023
The Proposal:
Maharashtra is the leading producer of onions in India, accounting for nearly 30% of the country's production. In the state onion is grown in all the three seasons of Kharif, Late Kharif and Rabi.
Since onion is perishable, the minimum support price cannot be applied to onion.
Onion is an important cash crop in Maharashtra and its price is very sensitive and intimate to the onion farmers. Domestic onion production, domestic demand and exports affect the price of onion in the market.
Till a few years ago, late kharif onion was being grown in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh. However, in 2-3 years, other states including Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat and West Bengal have started picking late kharif onion. Maharashtra is witnessing a low offtake of onion as it is available in the north Indian market in a short span of time at a low transportation cost from the state. At present, the arrival of red onion in the market is in full swing. Due to less storage capacity of red onion, there is less demand for this onion from abroad. Also, there is less demand in terms of supply as the onion is being purchased by the customers as per the requirement. As a result, the price of potato has crashed. In the month of January the market price of the onion has come down by 700 to 800 rupees and at present the price of the onion is 450 to 600 rupees per quintal.
The red onion of late kharif season is getting less price due to moisture and small size as well as due to damage to the onion copy. Due to this, the farmers are angry and news is being published in the newspapers.
In view of the fall in the market price of onion in the state and the demand for subsidy from various farmers' organizations and farmers, the government was considering the formation of a committee for" reduction and measures in the market price of onion."
