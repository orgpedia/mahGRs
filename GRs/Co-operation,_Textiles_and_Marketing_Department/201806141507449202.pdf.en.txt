GOVERNMENT DECISION, NO.: SAPAS-2018/ P.No. 167/24 C
Ministry, Extension, Mumbai-32
Date: 14th of June 2018
Reference:- (1) Decision of the State Cabinet Meeting dated 05/06/2018 (2) Memorandum of Government, Finance Department No. Figure 2018/ Q. No.6/ Meaning 13,
The date is June 8, 2018.
Preamble: Procurement of Tur and Gram under Minimum Support Price (MSP) Scheme in the State for 2017-18 has been started by NAFED through its Panan Federation and Vidarbha Panan Federation from 1st February, 2018 and 1st March, 2018 respectively. However, the procurement of tur and gram in the state was going on at a very slow pace as the godowns in the state were completely full due to the large-scale procurement of tur in the last year's season. The State Warehousing Corporation has taken on lease 183 godowns other than the Corporation in the State. However, this storage facility is very inadequate. Presently, rainfall across the State is receding. The monsoon is expected to arrive in the second week of June. There is no space available for storage of purchased tur and gram in the state.
Purchase of Toor has been stopped since 15/05/2018 and remaining 1,92,076 farmers are yet to purchase Toor. Further, procurement of Gram has been stopped since 29/05/2018 and balance 2,18,608 farmers are left with Tur. As per letter dated 05.06.2018, NAFED has given only 8 days extension till 13.06.2018 for procurement of Gram.
Keeping this in view, the Cabinet in its meeting held on 05.06.2018 has decided to provide a subsidy of Rs.1000/- per quintal to the farmers who have registered for procurement of Tur and Gram but have not procured Tur or Gram from them. A separate government decision is being issued on the recommendation of the cabinet sub-committee on the scheme's criteria and procedures.
