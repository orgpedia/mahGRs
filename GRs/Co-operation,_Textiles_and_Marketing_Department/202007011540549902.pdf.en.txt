GOVERNMENT DECISION NO. SAPAS-2020/ P.K. 56/24 C
Ministry of Health, Mumbai- 32
Date: July 1, 2020
Reference:- 1) Guidelines issued by the Central Government under PM-AASHA in October 2018
Letter dated January 6, 2020
Preamble: Procurement of oilseeds and pulses at Minimum Support Price (MSP) in the State has been started from 2013-14. The guidelines were issued by the central government in May 2014. In the year 2018, the Central Government has included the Price Support Scheme under the PM-AASHA Scheme along with the Price Stabilization Fund Private Procurement& Stockist Scheme Schemes and the revised guidelines in this regard have been issued in October 2018.
In the guidelines issued in October 2018, the transportation cost from the procurement center to the warehouse within a distance of 30 km has been approved. Subsequently, a high-level committee constituted under PM AASHA has allowed the transportation cost by increasing the transportation limit to 50 km. Further, 50 km. The committee, headed by the Chief Secretary, is required to examine the matter on a case-by-case basis and make its recommendations while fixing the traffic limit for a distance of more than 50 km. The Committee has to approve the locations where all the godowns near the procurement centre within the limit of one kilometre are fully occupied and the godowns and other godowns of Central Warehousing Corporation (CWC)/ State Warehousing Corporations (MSWC) are not available, and the recommendation of this Committee has to be made to the Central Nodal Agency by the concerned department, the letter dated January 6, 2020, said.
The State has been procuring large quantities of pulses and oilseeds since the season 2016-2017 under guaranteed procurement, leading to difficulties in storage within the transportation limits prescribed by the Central Government. Correspondence to the central government for raising the traffic limit and getting approval for the proposal takes a long time and adversely affects the procurement process.
