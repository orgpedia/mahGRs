13. Letter from Commissioner Cooperation and Registrar, Cooperative Societies, Pune No. Banks/ 1-SA/ OTS/ 2022/1071 dated 12.05.2022.
Preamble: For effective recovery of unpaid loans of urban cooperative banks in the state, the government has earlier approved the implementation of a one-time loan repayment scheme as recommended to the government by the Commissioner and Registrar of Cooperative Societies, Maharashtra State, Pune.
Several urban cooperative banks had sought an extension of the one-time loan repayment scheme. Periodic extension of the one-time loan repayment scheme has so far helped in reducing the mounting NPAs of urban cooperative banks. Keeping this in mind, the proposal to extend the one-time loan repayment scheme for urban cooperative banks was under the consideration of the government.
For effective recovery of unproductive loans of urban cooperative banks, the Commissioner of Cooperation and Registrar, Cooperative Societies, Maharashtra State, Pune has issued reference No. The Government has decided to extend the one-time loan repayment scheme for urban cooperative banks with certain modifications, as recommended under letter No. 11.
GOVERNMENT DECISION: The Government is approving the implementation of one-time loan repayment scheme for urban cooperative banks as mentioned in Annexure A to this Government Decision. In exercise of the powers conferred by Section 157 of the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960, the Government hereby exempts the Urban Cooperative Banks of Maharashtra from the provisions of Rule 49 of the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Rules, 1961, for implementing the scheme subject to the guidelines of the Reserve Bank of India.
