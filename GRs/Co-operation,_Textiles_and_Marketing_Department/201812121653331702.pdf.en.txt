Preamble: The Textile Policy of the State has been notified vide Government Resolution dated 15th February, 2018. The silk industry is an agriculture and forestry based industry with huge employment potential. The weather in Maharashtra is favourable. Therefore, there is a lot of scope for silk production in the state. It is an industry that helps in raising the economic level and living standards of the people in rural areas along with increasing the rate of agricultural development.
The scheme is being implemented under various schemes of the central and state governments. However, due to lack of complete information about this industry to the farmers and beneficiaries, the farmers of the state are not seen turning to this industry on a large scale. Keeping this in mind, a number of measures have been aimed to be taken during the policy period 2018-23 to develop the silk industry. Accordingly,' Mahareshim Abhiyan" is being carried out every year for wide publicity and dissemination. The" Maharesham Abhiyan-2018" has received an overwhelming response in the state and a large number of names have been registered for mulberry cultivation and tussar silk. It has been decided to take the services of the stakeholders of BARTI to promote and disseminate the campaign to the farmers who want to cultivate mulberry in the year 2019. Accordingly, according to the proposal submitted by the Director (Reshim), information about the assistance from the government should be made public and the public should be informed about the expected income from this scheme. The Government was contemplating to implement' Maha-Reshim Abhiyaan-2019" for registration of farmers who had cultivated mulberry during the year 2019 from 15th December, 2018 to 29th December, 2018.
