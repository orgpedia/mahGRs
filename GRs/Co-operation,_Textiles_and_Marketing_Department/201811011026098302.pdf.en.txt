To take timely and expeditious action in court cases.
The Government of Maharashtra
Department of Cooperation, Marketing and Textiles,
Government Circular No:- SASAKA 2018/ PR No. 284/25-C
Madam Cama Marg, Hutatma Rajguru Chowk,
Mantralaya, Mumbai 400032
Date:- 30.10.2018
The government has issued instructions from time to time to handle the court cases in a time-bound and priority manner. Also, the government has issued instructions to appoint a controlling/ coordinating officer in each office to control the court cases. However, it has been observed that in recent times, affidavits have been submitted for government approval in many court cases through the office of the Sugar Commissioner. Similarly, during the hearing of a court case, the officers/ employees who do not have the information are sent to the responsible and informed officials in the office of the Sugar Commissioner/ Regional Joint Director. Therefore, in many cases, the government's side is done properly and within the time limit. As the affidavit was not submitted before the court, the secretary level affidavit was filed. The court's order has been observed. In some cases, the draft affidavit has been submitted to the government for approval a day before or on the same day. In such cases, the government gets very little time to approve the affidavit after receiving all the information/ documents of the cases in a very short time and studying it and taking into account the information received. Therefore, it is not possible to present the government's side properly in a short period of time and alternatively, the judicial decision is likely to go against the government. Therefore, all these matters should be taken seriously by the Commissioner of Sugar and Regional Joint Director (Sugar) and henceforth the court should take care of time bound and prompt action as follows.
(1) On receipt of the new judicial case from the Public Prosecutor or the mutual petitioner, the original writ petition (petition) should be received by the concerned Joint Director or the concerned Director of the Sugar Commissioner's Office in person in the Public Prosecutor's Office within two days with all the relevant accompanying letters and submitted to the higher office immediately.
(2) The Government shall prepare paragraph-wise opinion on each of the issues raised in such petition after making a thorough study of the prevailing laws and rules as well as the directions issued by the Government from time to time. The responsibility of preparing this paragraph-wise feedback will be of the concerned Regional Joint Director and the concerned Joint Director in the Sugar Commissioner's Office. The process should be completed within the stipulated time or within two days.
(3) On the preparation of the paragraph-wise opinion, the Commissioner of Sugar shall personally examine and file the draft of the affidavit with the concerned Assistant Public Prosecutor in person along with the letter to the Regional Joint Director or, as the case may be, the Additional Public Prosecutor by the knowledgeable and responsible officers/ employees of the Joint Director's office in the office of the Commissioner of Sugar and obtain the receipt thereof.
