In order to make the marketing system of agricultural produce more competitive to get the maximum price for the produce produced by the farmers, the Maharashtra Agricultural Produce Marketing (Development and Regulation) Act, 1963 has been amended from time to time to provide an alternative marketing channel for the farmers and other market units. However, despite the creation of an alternative system, the prevailing market system and the new alternative system have not been of much use to the farmers in getting more market price by creating competition in the true sense. Therefore, the formation of a study group to study the private market yards in the state was under the consideration of the government.
Government Decision: The Government hereby approves the constitution of a Study Group to examine the following issues with regard to private market yards in the State.
The composition of the study group:
