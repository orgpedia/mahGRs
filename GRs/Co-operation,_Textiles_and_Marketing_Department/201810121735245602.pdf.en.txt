Introduction: The Maharashtra State Agricultural Marketing Board (MSAMB) is implementing the Agriculture Mortgage Loan Scheme for farmers every year with the participation of the Agricultural Produce Market Committees of the state. There is good response from the Agricultural Produce Market Committees every year in implementing the Agriculture Mortgage Loan Scheme and the scope of this scheme is increasing day by day. Many agricultural produce market committees in the state do not have the facility of warehouses for storing agricultural produce, which is causing inconvenience to the market committees in implementing the Pledge Loan Scheme for farmers. Also, the market committees do not have adequate warehousing facilities to store the agricultural produce purchased under the Minimum Support Price (MSP) procurement scheme of the state government. Setting up of warehouses in the premises of Agricultural Produce Market Committees in the state as per the rating of Warehousing Development and Regulatory Authority (WDRA), New Delhi will help the market committees to implement the Agricultural Produce Mortgage Loan Scheme more effectively. Also, with the creation of a large storage capacity in the premises of market committees, it can also be used for the Minimum Support Price (MSP) procurement scheme of the state government.
This will help raise farmers" income. For the benefit of farmers, the government was considering the issue of setting up godowns in the premises of 108 agricultural produce market committees in the state.
The government has decided to set up godowns in all the 108 agricultural produce market committees in the state. The 25th State Level Project Sanctioning Committee Meeting held on 25/07/2018 has approved and provided funds for the financial year 2018-19. The state's 108
