Preamble: Due to the large-scale production of tur in the 2016-17 season in the state, the market price of tur has increased and the farmers are getting a lower market price than the minimum support price fixed for tur, tur has been purchased at a guaranteed price under various schemes by the central and state governments.
The State Government has procured 25.25 lakh quintals of Tur under Market Intervention Scheme from its own funds. In this regard, the No. 2 permissions have been given as per the government decision here. However, it is going to take a long time to sell tur dal in bulk. It's been a year since I bought it. Therefore, it is necessary to take immediate action. Therefore, the matter of forming a committee to decide on the sale of all tur and tur at the price obtained through open tender was under the consideration of the government.
Government Decision: In view of the discussion and directions given in the Cabinet meeting in this regard, a committee is being constituted to decide on the sale of all tur and tur produced in the Kharif season 2016-17 and purchased under the Market Intervention Scheme of the State Government, as per the formula adopted by NAFED for deciding the price of sale through open tender etc.
