The silk industry is proving to be a boon for the farmers of the state in order to avoid losses due to the vagaries of the environment as well as to get regular income. Silk farming and industries have the potential to provide sustainable income to the farmers. Therefore, in the Textile Policy 2018-23 of the State, which was announced through a Government Resolution dated 15th February, 2018, it has been decided to take several measures to promote the silk industry in the State.
Several schemes are being implemented by the central and state governments for the development of the state. A massive campaign has been launched to register new beneficiaries who want to cultivate mulberry and want to do tussar silk industry by reaching out to more and more farmers in the state through the Maharesham Abhiyan. The expansion and development of sericulture is effective and it is necessary to cultivate mulberry in a group way to ensure integrated development along with the post-harvesting process from mulberry cultivation to textile production. The programme is being implemented in 120 clusters in 25 districts under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS). Besides, subsidy is provided to silk farmers under the Nanaji Deshmukh Krishi Sanjivani Yojana implemented by the Agriculture Department.
