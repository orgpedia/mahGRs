note
1) Power subsidy for existing units will be provided only for a period of 2 years as per rates given in Annexure-A.
Page 24 of 24.
# Page 25
Government Resolution No: Policy 2023/ P. No.81/ Tex-5
After the stipulated period of 2 years, electricity subsidy will not be given. However, the amount will be provided as capital subsidy to the solar power project after calculating the amount of electricity subsidy for 12 months.
The guidelines for solar projects for existing units will be as follows:● Project Report (DPR) for solar power projects will need to be approved by Maharashtra Energy Development Agency (MEDA)/ any other agency as decided by the Government from time to time.
After commissioning of the solar power project, the capital subsidy will be provided in 2 equal installments (6 months gap between installments).
4) There will be a limit of Rs 40 lakh per unit (per textile unit) per month on monthly power subsidy distribution.
5) Expansion units/ new units The Detailed Project Report (DPR) shall include the cost of setting up of the solar power plant and the cost of the solar plant (excluding land and building construction and subject to a maximum limit of 4 MW) in the eligible plant and machinery while calculating the capital subsidy payable.
Textile units/ plants can set up solar plants of more than 4 MW capacity, but the unit/ plant will bear the entire financial burden of solar plant capacity above 4 MW.
However, in no case the total capacity of the solar power plant shall exceed the sanctioned load/ contracted demand of conventional power.
Important points to note:
After the installation of solar power units, it will be the responsibility of the textile units to maintain its efficiency. In case, the solar power generation unit becomes unusable due to any reason, the rates of electricity supplied by Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) will be applicable without any subsidy/ deduction.
There will be no limit of 1 MW on net metering for textile industry.
The Energy Department of the State Government shall not levy any charges other than" Transmission Charges" on projects using non-conventional sources (solar, wind etc.).
When any unit is using conventional and non-conventional energy at the same time, the use of both the energy sources will be taken into account to determine the load factor.
Green Technology:- The assistance from the Government for the promotion of green technology will be as follows: 2.1. Waste Water Treatment Plants (ETPs) and Combined Waste Water Treatment Plants (CWTPs)- 50% capital subsidy for construction or Rs.5 crore, whichever is less, will be provided in all the zones of the State.
On page 44 of 25

Government Resolution No: Policy 2023/ P. No.81/ Tex-5
The grant will be used for new projects. Clusters approved under the cluster development programme of the Department of Industries will be eligible for subsidy for setting up of combined effluent treatment plants.
2.2 Support for Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD)- A subsidy of 50% (up to a maximum of Rs.10 crore) of the cost of eligible construction (Civil Infrastructure) and machinery for setting up of ZLD projects will be provided in all zones of the State. The total cost of the project does not include the cost of the land.
3) Water will be reserved for the treatment plants as these projects require a large amount of water.
7.6. Knitting, Hosiery and Garmenting Sector: Maharashtra currently has 110 knitting, hosiery and garmenting units. The state government will provide incentives to boost the textile sector in the state, to complete the value chain promoting the sale of finished products.
Incentives: Zone wise capital subsidy and power subsidy will be provided to the Knitting, Hosiery, Garmenting projects to be set up under this policy as shown in the following table: 1) Capital subsidy and power subsidy Table No.13

7.7 Silk Industry:
The state of Maharashtra is a non-traditional silk producing state, producing both mulberry and tussar silk. It also ranks first in silk production among non-traditional states and 13th among 29 silk producing states. As the sericulture industry is based on agriculture and forest wealth, at present 12,809 farmers are engaged in sericulture through mulberry cultivation in an area of about 13,582 acres. In the state 853 farmers are engaged in tussar silk industry on 3963 hectares area.
Mulberry is cultivated in 27 districts of Maharashtra and tussar in 4 districts, so a total of 31 districts are involved in silk production. In the case of mulberry silk, all the districts of Aurangabad and Pune divisions are significantly ahead in silk production areas. Tussar silk is mainly found in four districts of eastern Vidarbha- Gondia, Gadchiroli, Bhandara and Chandrapur. Thus, Maharashtra is one of the major non-conventional silk producing states and silk is emerging as a major industry among farmers. With the right climate, land and environmental conditions in the state, there are opportunities for large-scale silk production in the future. Efforts will be made to increase the production of silk yarn and silk thread to produce more silk than the traditional silk producing states.
Incentives and measures:
