Department of Cooperation, Marketing and Textiles, Government Resolution, No.Gotus 1108/ Q.No. 698/2-S, dated 01/12/2008
The Proposal:
As per the recommendations of the Vaidyanathan Committee appointed by the Central Government to strengthen the cooperative agricultural credit structure, the State Government has signed an MoU with the Central Government and NABARD on 13/11/2006. The Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960 has also been amended. After the amendment, Article 69 (b) provides for the formation of state-level and district-level committees to resolve the problems of block secretaries in the state. Accordingly, the state level and district level committees have been constituted as per the decision of the government.
However, in view of the technical difficulties in respect of the bifurcated districts of Dhule-Nandurbar, Akola-Washim, Parbhani-Hingoli, Thane-Palghar, the government was considering amendments in the state level and district level committees in this decision.
