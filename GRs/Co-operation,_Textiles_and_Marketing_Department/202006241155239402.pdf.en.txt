Employees who do not repay the loan by the date of their retirement are not issued a non-payment certificate by this office and their pension is withheld but if the non-payment certificate is issued by this office, the pension of the said employee is received by him. However, when most of the employees are not being paid their salary, the concerned employees come to this office before their retirement days, receive the challan, pay the loan and interest thereon to the Reserve Bank of India, Mumbai and submit the challan to this office. A non-payment certificate is issued to them after verifying the invoices. So that they do not face any problem in getting their pension.

Since the lockdown was imposed on March 23, 2020, the office of the 19th has not been able to continue regularly. The concerned employees contact this office from all corners of Maharashtra but due to the transport and closure of the office, the details of the amount collected by the concerned employees are not available.
Even though the Government of Maharashtra has relaxed the lockdown restrictions to some extent with effect from 8th June, 2020, the concerned employee is not able to submit their recovery reports due to the following reasons.
