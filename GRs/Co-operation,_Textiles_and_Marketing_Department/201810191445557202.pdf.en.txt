The Proposal:
For effective recovery of unpaid loans of urban cooperative banks in the state, the government has earlier approved the implementation of a one-time loan repayment scheme as recommended by the Commissioner and Registrar of Cooperative Societies, Maharashtra State, Pune.
Periodic extension of the one-time loan repayment scheme has so far helped in reducing the mounting NPAs of urban cooperative banks. Keeping this in mind, the proposal to extend the one-time loan repayment scheme for urban cooperative banks was under the consideration of the government.
Government's decision:
For effective recovery of unpaid loans of urban cooperative banks, a letter has been sent to the Commissioner and Registrar of Cooperative Societies, Maharashtra State, Pune. Increase/ 2018/ 1647, Dy. In exercise of the powers conferred by section 157 of the Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act, 1960, as recommended under 1.09.2018, the Government have decided to exempt the Urban Co-operative Banks in Maharashtra from the provisions of Rule 49 of the Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Rules, 1961 for implementing the scheme subject to the guidelines of the Reserve Bank of India, vide G.O.S.No. 15.11.2017
