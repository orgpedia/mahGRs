There are 153 lakh farmers in the state. These farmers take loans from commercial banks and district central cooperative banks for farming and agriculture-related activities. For four consecutive years, from 2015-16 to 2018-19, a huge amount of less than 50 paise was released due to drought-like situation in various parts of the state.
