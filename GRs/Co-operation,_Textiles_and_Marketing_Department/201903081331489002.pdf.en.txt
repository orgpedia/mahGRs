Read- Government Decision Cooperation, Marketing and Textile Department, No. Policy No.6/ Tax-5 dated 15th February, 2018.
Textile sector plays a very important role in the economic structure of the state. After agriculture, textile industry is one of the most important industries in the state. After agriculture, this industry has the potential to create maximum employment. Keeping this in view, the State Government has notified the Textile Policy 2018-23 dated 15.02.2018. One of the key objectives of the policy is to build eco-friendly textile units. The cost of electricity consumption is a major contributor to the running costs of textile components. In order to reduce this burden on textile units, textile units need to be incentivized to use green/ non-conventional energy. For this, the government was considering setting up a non-conventional energy development cell to increase the use of non-conventional energy sources in the textile industry.
Government Decision:- The Government is approving the establishment of a Non-Conventional Energy Development Cell under the control of the Director (Textiles) to increase the use of non-conventional energy sources in the textile industry in the state. The working pattern of this class will be as follows:
1. Textile components can be replaced by non-conventional energy, e.g., conventional electricity. Technical support should be sought from SASMIRA, WRA, CITRA, IIT, IIM as well as reputed institutions working in the field of green energy to prepare a plan for incentivizing the use of solar energy, wind energy in projects.
2. Proposal for a scheme to provide special incentives to textile units using non-conventional energy such as solar/ wind power in their projects.
3. Formulate a scheme in collaboration with MEDA for providing subsidy for setting up of green energy projects to textile mills, machinery and textile industries, if they are willing to set up green energy projects.
A committee has been formed to ensure the smooth functioning of the department.
