The Proposal:
The Maharashtra State Handloom Corporation, which is under the Textile Department, is provided financial assistance by the government in the form of loans and equity. The financial condition of the company is very bad. Due to this economic situation, the handloom corporations are unable to meet the demands of the weavers. Therefore, the weavers of this handloom corporation approach the court regarding their demands. It was handed over to the corporation. As on 31.03.2023, a total of 7 cases are pending for adjudication in the Labour Court, 1 case in the Industrial Court and 7 cases in the High Court. At present, 15 cases are pending in the court. Therefore, the possibility of financial burden on the Corporation cannot be ruled out if the said court cases are settled against the Corporation in future. The possibility of the handloom corporation repeatedly demanding the government to provide funds as a special case cannot be ruled out. For this, the government was considering providing" funds for judicial work" to the handloom corporation in the form of loans. With a view to ensure that the Handloom Corporation does not defy the court directions in future, it is decided to make available funds from the Finance Department through supplementary demand for the Handloom Corporation under the Department of Textiles as per the commitment.
Government's decision:
The Maharashtra State Handloom Corporation has been allocated Rs. 4, 13, 37, 169/-for these special items, Government approval is being accorded for availability of additional funds through Supplementary Demands from Finance Department.
