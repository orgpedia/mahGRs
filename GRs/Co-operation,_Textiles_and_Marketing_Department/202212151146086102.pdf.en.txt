Date: 14th of December 2022
Reference:- 1) Minimum Support Price Scheme of the Central Government
Guidelines as of October 11, 2018
Central Government Number- L- 15016/88/2017-MPS,
Letter from December 8, 2017
Preamble: The procurement of pulses and oilseeds for Kharif and Rabi seasons is done through NAFED as per the base price fixed by the Central Government every year. The Central Government has issued guidelines dated 11.10.2018 for procurement of pulses (Moong, Urad, Tur and Gram) and oilseeds (Soyabean) under Minimum Support Price (MSP). Accordingly, NAFED procures pulses and oilseeds in the state.
The State Government has appointed 8 agencies i) PANAN Federation, Mumbai ii) Vidarbha PANAN Federation, Nagpur ii) MahaFPC, Pune iv) Pruthashakti, Ahmednagar v) WAPCO, Nagpur vi) Mahakisan Sangh, Ahmednagar vii) Mahakisan Vriddhi, Nashik and vii) Mahaswarajya Farmers Producer Company Federation, Devla, Distt.
The Maharashtra State Cooperative Marketing Federation, Mumbai was the only State level nodal agency for procurement at guaranteed price in the State since 2013-14. The Vidarbha Co-operative Marketing Federation, Nagpur has been declared as the State Level Nodal Agency from the season 2017-18 to assist the Maharashtra State Co-operative Marketing Federation (MSSMCF) in the State of Maharashtra in view of the increase in procurement at guaranteed price in the State during 2016-17. Further, as per the instructions of the Central Government to link the Farmer Producer Companies with the procurement programme of NAFED, with a view to strengthen the Farmer Producer Companies, which are mainly functioning at the village level, from the season 2019-20, the apex body of Farmer Producer Companies, FPC, Pune, has been asked to set up a State level

It has been declared as a nodal agency. Subsequently, considering the increasing participation of women in Farmer Producer Companies, Pruthashakti Farmer Producer Company Ltd., with a predominantly women Board of Directors, has been incorporated to provide representation to women in the procurement process. WAPCO, Nagpur has been declared as the State level Nodal Agency from the season 2021-22 to assist Ahmednagar for the season 2020-21 and Vidarbha Marketing Federation, Nagpur for the procurement at guaranteed price. Mahakisan Sangha Agricultural Producer Company Ltd. from the season 2022-23. Ahmednagar, Mahakisan Vriddhi Agro Producer Company Ltd. Nashik and Mahasvarajya Farmers Producer Company Federation, Devla, District Nashik have been declared as state level nodal institutions.
Maharashtra State Cooperative Marketing Federation, Mumbai and the Vidarbha Cooperative Marketing Federation, Nagpur are the apex bodies in the cooperative sector in the state, mostly functioning at the taluk level. However, FPO Federations representing farmers have been appointed to work at the Mandal level to ensure that the benefits of the assured price reach maximum farmers.
Prathashakti Farmer Producer Company Ltd. After declaring Ahmednagar as the state-level nodal institute, many proposals are being received by the government. The Federation of Farmer Producer Companies, which wants to be the state nodal agency, does not have the experience of buying pulses and oilseeds at guaranteed prices. They don't have basic facilities. These organizations are known only to the farmers who are members of them. Also, since these organisations are mainly from Nashik and Ahmednagar districts, an FPO can be a member of more than one FPO federation.
Therefore, it will be difficult to fix responsibility in case of irregularities in the purchase.
There is a possibility of confusion in the procurement work as the member organizations of the organization do not have the experience of purchasing pulses and oilseeds. As a result, the possibility of creating problems in coordinating the work can not be ruled out if more than the required number of agencies are appointed for procurement at guaranteed prices. Large scale political pressure tactics are being used to appoint this agency as State Nodal Agency. For this, the government was considering a policy to appoint state nodal agencies for the purchase of pulses and oilseeds at guaranteed prices under the Minimum Support Price scheme.
Government Decision: In order to make the process of procurement of pulses and oilseeds under Minimum Support Price (MSP) scheme in the State smooth and transparent, the following policy is being formulated for appointment of State Nodal Agencies
