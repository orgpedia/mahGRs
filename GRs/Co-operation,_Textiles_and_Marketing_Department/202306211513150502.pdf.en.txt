Preamble: As per the Government Resolution No. 90/ 2022/ S. No. 3 dated 9th December, 2022 every day in the State is 1250 May. The distillation capacity of cooperative sugar mills with a distillation capacity of 2500 MT per day. Administrative approval has been given for giving government share for tonnage. Most of the factories in the state have been expanded, and only a few have been closed since May 1250, as they are not economically viable. Factories with ton per day filtration capacity have not been able to expand. In the year 1250. Because of the very low filtration capacity of tons per day, the amount of sugar, molasses and other by-products produced by such factories is less than that of other factories. Also, the production cost is high. In the course of running such factories, the old machinery in the factory, the excess of employees, the expense of insufficient working capital, the huge interest to be paid on the loans taken, and other such reasons, led to the collapse of the factory in May 1250. Factories with a filtration capacity of tons per day have not been economically viable for many years. Therefore, as per the decision taken under the Government decision dated 9 th December, 2022, the Government was contemplating to create a new head of account for the collection of interest on the cost (equity) loan for the provision of funds for making equity available to the concerned cooperative sugar mills. Accordingly, in accordance with the approval given by the Office of the Principal Accountant General, Mumbai vide letter dated 9th June, 2023 mentioned in Reference No. 3 to the new Deposit Accounts Title proposed by the Department and agreed to by the Department of Planning and Finance, the Government is taking the following decisions.
