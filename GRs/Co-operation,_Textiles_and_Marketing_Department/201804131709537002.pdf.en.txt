Detailed instructions have also been given in the circular dated 30th April, 2016.
The role of the presenting officer is very important in the departmental inquiry cases to be issued in a timely and proper manner. The departmental inquiry ordered under Rule 8 of the Maharashtra Civil Services (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1979, has to be completed within six months. The government guidelines were not followed. Also, sometimes the allegations are not proved because the presenting officers take such a stand that it will help the victim. And the government has found that the investigation is not completed within the stipulated time.
In view of the above, the Presenting Officer is being instructed to complete the proceedings of the departmental inquiry in a time-bound manner by performing his duties and responsibilities regularly, as follows: a) The action to be taken after appointment as Presenting Officer:

(4) If, after considering the case, it is felt necessary to include some more witnesses other than those in the list, the Inquiry Officer shall be requested to do so with the prior permission of the Disciplinary Authority.
Talk to the witnesses and explain their role. They should also be given an idea of what questions they can ask and be prepared with answers.
Since all the officers under the Co-operation Department are the presenting officers, they should clearly present the argument to the investigating officer as to what provisions and how the provisions of the Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act 1960 and Rules 1961 have been violated. This will help in proving the guilt of the accused.
