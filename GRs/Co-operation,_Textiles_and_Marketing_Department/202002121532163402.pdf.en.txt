Introduction: Under the Government Resolution No. 1, the State Government has decided to provide short-term crop loans at 6% interest to the farmers of the State.

For this purpose, the financial burden of the 1% interest differential amount is on the government. The benefit of this decision is being given to the District Central Co-operative Banks, Nationalized Banks and Regional Rural Banks in the State during Kharif and Rabi seasons since 2006-07 and to the private banks who have disbursed short term crop loans up to Rs. 3.00 lakh to the farmers since 2013-14.
