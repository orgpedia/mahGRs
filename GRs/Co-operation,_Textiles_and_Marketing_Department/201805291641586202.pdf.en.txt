Letter from the Director (Silk), Nagpur No. Sale of Silk/ Works-7/ Tussar Yarn/ GST
18/199 dated 25.4.218.
The Proposal:
The government procures silk from the producers through the Directorate of Silk. The process of conversion of silk yarn by processing these cells is done by the Directorate. The Maharashtra State Handloom Corporation is a state-owned enterprise.
The company is engaged in the manufacture and sale of handloom fabrics. Reference 1 to the above, the silk yarn produced by the Directorate of Silk is supplied to the Maharashtra State Handloom Corporation on credit for a period of three months without resorting to tender method.
Director (Reshim). Since the Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 has come into force in the State vide letter dated 25.04.2018, the Directorate of Silk has registered under the said Act and it is mandatory to file the Goods and Services Tax return within a period of one month from the date of issue of the sales invoice after the sale of silk yarn. The Maharashtra State Handloom Corporation has sought a one-month moratorium on payment of silk interest on credit, instead of three months, as the provision of one-month moratorium on payment of Goods and Services Tax on credit for three months is creating difficulties. The Government was considering the proposal to increase the interest on loans to the Maharashtra State Handloom Corporation from three months to one month, submitted by the Director (Silk) to the Government.
Government's decision
The Government has decided to provide silk yarn to the Maharashtra State Handloom Corporation from the Director (Silk). as on 30.10.2004. But after the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax Act in the state, it has been made mandatory to pay the Goods and Services Tax within one month from the date of sale transaction. In view of this provision of the Goods and Services Tax Act, the period of silk interest credit to the Maharashtra State Handloom Corporation is being increased from three months to one month. All other conditions and guidelines of the Government Decision dated 30.10.2004 regarding this sale transaction shall continue to apply as before.
