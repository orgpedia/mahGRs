About 60 to 70% of the available water reserves in the state are used for irrigation. Proper planning of water is in order in the backdrop of frequent droughts in the state. Micro-irrigation technology has proved to be useful in bringing maximum area under irrigation with minimum use of water. This technology saves about 30 to 50% of water. Micro-irrigation not only saves water, but also saves cost on fertilizers and medicines. Overall, micro-irrigation has led to savings in input costs for farmers and increased productivity and income for farmers.
The Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority (MWRRA) has issued a notification to increase the efficiency and productivity of the available water and to make the saved water available on a equitable basis to the surface area of the project. As per the notification dated 25th June, 2015, it has been made mandatory to adopt drip and drip irrigation methods for irrigation of perennial crops in the beneficiary areas of 1) Tembhu Sub-Scheme 2) Bhima (Ujani) 3) Mula 4) Lower Level 5) Hatnur 6) Urdhvapus 7) Kanholi Nala (Nagpur) and 8) Amboli (Sindhudurg) pilot projects by June, 2018. Based on the experience gained after adopting drip/ drip irrigation method on the above pilot project, the restriction will be imposed on other projects in the state from the year 2019.

Due to expansion area under sugarcane is increasing along with other cash crops. As the area grows, so does the demand for water. For sugarcane during its full growth period 25000 cubic meter/ ha. So much water is needed. By using drip irrigation for sugarcane crop, 30 to 50% water is saved. That is 7500 to 12500 cubic meter/ he. So much water can be saved. Therefore, it is necessary to bring the area under sugarcane crop under micro-irrigation.
The state's total sugarcane production is 9.42 lakh tonnes. is the area. The area is estimated to be around 2.25 lakh sq. This area has been brought under micro-irrigation. The area under drip irrigation has been reduced to 7.18 lakh. The area is under irrigation. However, the present canal system and water supply is not suitable for micro irrigation system due to the difference in the distance between the 2 cradles provided by the irrigation channel. To bring the area under sugarcane crop under micro-irrigation in the beneficiary areas, it is very important to build water reserves first. For this, some time is needed to set up basic facilities. Considering this fact, it is possible to bring the area under crops grown on the water of rivers, streams, wells, natural streams and streams under drip irrigation. Considering these aspects, the scheme is being implemented as per the Government Decision dated 24.07.2017 of the Department of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, Dairy Development and Fisheries to bring 3.05 lakh hectares of area under micro-irrigation in the first phase covering 1.5 lakh hectares in 2018-19 and 1.5 5 lakh hectares in 2019-20. The government was considering issuing guidelines and procedures for the implementation of the scheme.
The modalities and guidelines for effective implementation of the scheme in the above background are as follows: i) The scheme will be implemented for cooperative as well as private sugar mills in the State. Department of Agriculture. As per the Government Resolution dated 24.7.2017
Drip irrigation is mandatory for sugarcane crop in the eight beneficiary areas mentioned in the proposal.
The scheme will cover all the factories in the above mentioned areas.
It will be applicable to all farmers.
(ii) The scheme will cover an area of 1.5 lakh hectares in 2018-19, which will be irrigated by rivers, streams, wells and community lift irrigation.
