Government Decision No. 2. Narrow 1001/ (378/2001)/ C.V. (Dho), Dy. 21.11.2002 3. Majnipra Petition No. 10/2019 dated 11/05/2020
The State Government had constituted a" Special Inquiry Committee on Irrigation" to study in depth the issues related to various aspects of completed and under-construction irrigation projects in Maharashtra. The state government has taken many reforms in the context of this inquiry committee report. Its Action Taken Report (ATR) and 42 recommendations have been accepted by the government. In addition, the Committee has recorded its views in the Inquiry Report to make improvements in respect of several aspects.
Many of the state government's projects are centrally funded and supported by the World Bank and NORBAD. The reports of these projects require the concurrence of the Central Water Commission (CWC). While obtaining this consent, the Commission has laid down the criteria for the same. e.g. projects with 75% trust, various water dispute arbitrations in respect of inter-State river basins e.g. Bachhawat Commission, Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal No. 2 have been established. They also have a project plan.
Once the water storage is created in the completed and under-construction projects, the use of water starts from it. The Committee has also found that the administrative sanction of the projects, e.g. The availability of water, crop structure, water use planning, siltation in the project, etc. change over time. Concepts in project conceptualization change with development process. Climate change changes the amount of precipitation, changes the area precipitation. This affects the availability of water. Increase in domestic and industrial water consumption in Bhama-Skhed project, Khadakwasla, Gangapur etc. reduces the planned irrigation capacity of the project. Sediment accumulation in the projects also reduces its water holding capacity. On the project

The off-take irrigation scheme on irrigation and canals also changes the irrigation sector to a great extent.
There is a need to review and reorient the water storage and water use projects which have been in operation for the last ten years. But since the scope of the subject is vast, it is necessary to study the projects in the Bhima sub-basin as a guide, to review and re-planning the projects, because the planning of the water in the Bhima sub-basin has been completed. Water is also used to its full capacity. There have also been major changes to the water system. Some of the projects, conceived with 50% trust, do not get Central Water Commission approval and central funding.
Considering this diversity of projects, there is a need to review and reorient the Bhima sub-projects. A committee had been formed for this.
Government Decision: As a pilot project, the government was considering the formation of a committee headed by a retired secretary at the government level to review the projects in the Bhima sub-basin and make recommendations on re-planning. A committee has been formed for this purpose.
