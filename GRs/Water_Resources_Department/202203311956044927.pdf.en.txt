the prelude
The 44.80-km long Pravara Right Canal, which starts from Bhandardara Dam on the Pravara River, and continues for 76.80-km, is the longest canal in the country. The Pravara Left Canal was completed during the British rule from 1926 to 1930. Through Pravara Right and Left Canal a total of 23077 hectare area of Sangamner, Shrirampur, Nevasa and Rahuri taluks of Ahmednagar district gets the benefit of irrigation.
As per the directions of the Hon'ble High Court dated 23/09/2016, in order to make the water distribution system suitable and efficient, as per the proposal received, the Bhandardara Mega Project has been completed. There is an urgent need to undertake restoration and renovation works of Pravara Left Canal Watercourse 7-9 under Akola G. Ahmednagar under special repair. After this, it will be possible to set up and transfer water use agencies for irrigation management to be done by farmers.
Keeping in view the water supply to important towns and Gram Panchayats, water supply to sugar mills and industrial areas, etc., it is necessary to increase the carrying capacity of Pravara canals by reducing the period of rotation of the canal and strengthening/ repairing the old structures as they have started leaking due to about 90 years. Accordingly, the construction of the renovation of the Pravara Left Canal Watercourse 7-9 is being carried out under a special administrative amendment.
