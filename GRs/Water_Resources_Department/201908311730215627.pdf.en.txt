Introduction: It has been observed that both the work of Nala Training and the work of Flood Protection Scheme (Nala Diversion) are being misused. There seems to be confusion among the field officers of the Agriculture and Irrigation Department as to who should do what work. It is now clear that the survey and construction of all the drain training work has to be done completely by the Agriculture Department, in this regard, the Irrigation Department and the Agriculture Department have issued government orders as per the serial numbers 3 and 4 circulated in the context of this matter. There is a need to issue clear orders on what is called drain training and flood protection.
Drainage training: The main objective of drain training is to improve the drainage of agricultural land and reduce the area of swamps and wetlands. There can be two main reasons for this. One is that the situation of obstruction of underground water flow due to certain geo-structures under the earth's crust is felt more strongly in the benefit zone of irrigation projects. To reduce the amount of wetland area in the benefit area, a plan is being implemented by the Directorate of Irrigation Research and Development, Pune for the last 70-80 years to dig underground chars from the poor land by improving the slope of the main drain by determining the exact location of the barrier under the surface.
The creation of wetlands outside the benefit area can be caused by encroachment of the drainage channel into a soft or river channel. This reduces the flow of water. The water is far away. In such places, the drainage of water can protect the surrounding land by increasing or improving the width of the drain. It is clear that these works have to be done by the Agriculture Department.

Flood protection works: The purpose of flood protection works is to protect the river or nullah from the flood water that spreads from the river to the surrounding areas due to which agricultural land, houses and people get submerged under water. Since the flood lasts for a few hours, there is usually no damage to the farmland. However, it is necessary to implement a flood prevention plan in the state to avoid financial loss and loss of life. The survey/ budget on flood prevention work is to be done by the Water Resources Department.
The government has taken a decision regarding the approval of the works of flood protection schemes.
This decision has been in place for more than 26 years. In view of the recent price hike, the directions of the Planning Commission, the Government of India, the orders issued by the National Green Tribunal in various court cases regarding the works in the flood line and flood prone areas, the government decisions issued in this regard, the matters mentioned by the Planning Department while agreeing to the administrative approval of the flood protection works, and the financial powers granted to the Water Resources Department for administrative approval, the government was considering a revised policy for the administrative approval of the flood protection works. A committee was formed for this purpose. The recommendations of the committee have been accepted by the government.
After considering all the above, the government is taking the following decisions regarding administrative approval after determining the revised policy for undertaking flood protection works.
Government's decision:
The purpose of flood protection work is to prevent and protect the flood flow caused by the discharge of rain into the river or drain/ dam from leaving the bank and spreading to the surrounding area.
The flood waters are inundating agricultural lands, houses, roads, settlements, factories, industries, religious and historical places. Since the flood discharge lasts for a few hours, the farm is usually not damaged. However, it is in order to implement a flood prevention plan to avoid financial and loss of life.
Flood protection work should generally include the following:
(a) Laying of soil, stone/ compost on the banks of river/ nullah.
(b) Construction of retaining wall.
(c) To give proper direction to the flow of river/ nullah.
3. Demand for flood protection works Municipal Corporation/ Municipality/ Gram Panchayat/ Zilla Parishad etc.
It should be done by the executive engineer of the water resources department through the local self-government institution.

The Water Resources Department should take up the work of detailed survey and budget of flood protection works only if the flood line has already been fixed.
If the flood line is not fixed then first the flood line should be fixed and its maps should be issued and then the survey and budget of the work of the flood protection scheme should be prepared.
The officials of the Water Resources Department should submit the budgets of the works in the jurisdiction of the Municipal Corporation/ Municipality/ Gram Panchayat/ Zilla Parishad or other local bodies to the Government for administrative approval by obtaining the consent letter of the Commissioner/ Chief Officer/ Chief Executive Officer, Zilla Parishad of the concerned local bodies. (See Appendix 2)

The consent letter in this regard should be submitted along with the demand letter by the concerned local body and it should be attached to the administrative approval proposal. (See Appendix 2)

Also, the condition of 10% of the population and 50% of the state government's loan assistance in the previous government decision is being completely removed.
The cost of survey and administrative sanction works will be borne by the Water Resources Department from the funds of the State Government.
There will be no limit on the funds to be taken from the state government. If the work is proposed under the central government program, the participation of the state government and local bodies will be mandatory as per the instructions.
If flood protection works and other works on inter-State rivers are to be taken up from the funds/ programmes of the Central Government, the Planning Department, Government of India vide Circular No. 16 (12)/ 1/99/ WR, Dy. 9/9/2003 or as applicable.
Flood protection works may be taken up once in 25 years for areas affected by flood discharge of this frequency (i.e. areas falling within the containment zone/ Blue Flood Line).
As the area inside the Blue Flood Line is a restricted area, no new construction can be carried out in that area as per the directions of the National Green Tribunal. However, as complete relocation or rehabilitation of existing lands, habitations, roads etc. is not possible, flood protection works are mandatory to protect against floods. While carrying out flood protection works, it should be ensured that there is no obstruction in the flow of the river and the carrying capacity of the river does not change.
New technologies/ GIS should be considered while proposing flood protection works. mapping of the work done. MRSAC/ Remote sensing images/ Drone survey should also be used. GIS mapping of the work done.
Project feasibility and cost-benefit ratio
Check the feasibility of the proposed work by taking out the profitability ratio. Annexure-1 is attached herewith. It has to be considered accordingly and that will be part of the budget.
This addendum should be attached with the signature of the concerned Chief Engineer. The chief engineer should inspect the site and prepare a note of the field visit to state the reasons for the urgency to undertake the work. And add it to your budget.
