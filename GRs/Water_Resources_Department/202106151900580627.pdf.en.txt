In the Khadakwasla irrigation system, the new Mutha right canal is from km 0 to km 202 and the old Mutha canal is from km 28 to km 109. The total irrigated area is 62142.00. Bhigwan Branch Canal at No. 73/445. I started on 28th.
The total length of the distributaries is 12.70 km with a total benefit area of 2279 hectares. The carrying capacity of the distribution is 100 cusecs (2.83 cumecs). This distribution will cover the districts of Kedgaon, Khutbav, Galandwadi and Pargaon. The profit area of Daund village comes under Jalita. The work of this distributor is done during the British period in about 1879. Trees have been uprooted and the distribution network has been disrupted. The well has been partially damaged and the drain is overflowing. Due to the increase in the number of trees, it has become difficult for the canal service line and the inspection team to reach during the irrigation period. The construction work on the canal is also in progress. The delivery time is increasing. The water does not reach the tail-end areas of the canal and the distribution needs to be repaired, for which there is a demand from the local people's representatives and beneficiaries of the area. Regular maintenance and repair of the entire canal system is not possible with the available funds. At present, the Bhigwan branch canal. The canal has been damaged due to the construction of I 21 to 28 canal, breaches, village road bridges, australization, drainage, etc. As a result, the flow of the canal is obstructed in every step and there is a huge leakage, as a result of which the rotation period is increased and water is being lost. Also, due to the fall in the current modernization, such types of canal ruptures are also occurring. Since this distribution needs to be repaired and these works need to be completed on priority, the corporation has recommended to the government to get administrative approval for these urgent and essential works. Also, the priorities were decided in the 141st meeting of the Executive Committee of the Corporation and accordingly, the Corporation has adopted Resolution No. Approved by 99/5. Further, the Corporation has made special amendments/ extensions and improvements as mentioned in the Water Resources Department, S.D. 01/08/2019.
