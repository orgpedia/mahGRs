Construction of the main canal and distribution system generally took place between 1960 and 1965. The above-named work place is Marlapur. The bridge was constructed over a canal near Vasmat G. Hingoli village in 1965. At present, the bridge is completely weakened, the masonry is crumbling, and the rock under the final supporting wall of the bridge is being eroded by natural means such as water, ice, canal water flow, etc. A portion of the roof was also ripped off by the traffic and the iron girders were left open on the upper side. Also, the inner iron gauze of the roof is exposed from the lower side and is in a rusted state. Vehicles and animals fall into the canal during irrigation due to the breakdown of the guardrail for this bridge.
