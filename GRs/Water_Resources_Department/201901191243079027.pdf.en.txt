Introduction: Coal Kharbhoomi Scheme, Taluka Vasai, District Palghar is included in the Kharbhoomi Scheme. The Union Forest Ministry has exempted the scheme under the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Act 1991. The total length of the project is 3900 m. The project is located on the right bank of Vasai Main Creek and Kaman Sub Creek. The scheme was constructed in the year 1966 and was renewed in the year 1989 with State funds.
At that time, the project was under construction. Due to high tides and incessant rains, the embankment has been eroded and the embankment above 3390 metres has been damaged. Most of the project area has been affected due to the collapse of the embankment and the weakening of the embankment. This inflicted heavy loss on the farmers. This plan needs to be revised. The dam and embankment of the original plan are not in accordance with the new technical standards of the government. Therefore, it is necessary to update the scheme according to the new technical standards. As there was a strong written demand from the gram panchayat, beneficiaries and public representatives to take up this scheme immediately, the proposal to give administrative approval to the renovation work of the Kol Kharbhoomi scheme received under the reference letter from the Chief Engineer, Water Resources Department, Konkan Region, Mumbai was under the consideration of the government.
