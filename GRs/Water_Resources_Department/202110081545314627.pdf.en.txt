GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: BISINNA 2019/ (350/19)/ CE (Dh-2)
Most water supply schemes take a gestation period to start. Normally during this period, the agency refrains from signing any contract or non-irrigation agreement with the agency, but the government does not receive any water bill. However, since the institute has reserved water, it is not being used by it and it is not being able to provide it to other applicants. In view of the huge revenue loss to the Government, while approving such water reservation proposal, the Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority, Mumbai shall take action as mentioned in paragraph 13.4 (v) of the Bulk Water Tariff Criteria, Part III for the State of Maharashtra. By entering into an agreement with the Water Resources Department, non-irrigated water users can specify a plan for phase-wise release of water as per the peak water demand. The final water demand will be assessed as follows on a year-wise basis till the supply commences.
a) Water consumption in the amount determined by the phase, at the applicable rate.
b) In case of water consumption (more/ less) of+ 10 water than the water consumption determined by the phase, the penal rate for the use of the difference is 1.5 times the applicable rate.
c) For the remaining quantity i.e. final planned water consumption minus stage-wise planned water consumption, 5% of the applicable rate as per commitment/ contract will be charged at the rate of 5% per annum.
10) The institution should install a system of purification of wastewater. Further, the detailed proposal in this regard shall be required to be communicated to the Water Resources/ Environment Department within the stipulated time, i.e. at the time of signing the agreement, otherwise the water reservation will be cancelled.
11) The organization should be given a letter of intent to use water first and a time of 3 months should be kept for signing the agreement. Only after the contract is signed, the actual water permit will be considered as issued. If the organization does not do this contract within the stipulated time (within 3 months), the water reservation of the organization will be automatically cancelled.
