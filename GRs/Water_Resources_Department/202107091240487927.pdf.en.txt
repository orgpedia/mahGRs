Reference:- Committee empowered to make recommendations on the acceptability of innovative technologies. Presentation on use of Bituminous Geo Membrane (BGM) technology and Committee's feedback during the 6th meeting held on 15.02.2021.
Introduction:
A Government Resolution dated 27th May, 2015 regarding setting up of Technology Approval Mechanism for promoting use of innovative technologies in Water Resources Department has been issued. The decision of the Government No. 2 Date of constitution of the Committee empowered to make recommendations on the acceptability of innovative technologies
This has been done as per the Government decision dated 28.11.2016. The Committee will consider the financial and technical requirements for adopting innovative technologies, building materials, machinery, project concept and design, construction methods for various project components in the Water Resources Department.
It makes recommendations to the government after examining the feasibility and on that instructions are given for further action at the government level.
Bituminous Geo membrane (BGM) technology:" Bituminous Geo membrane is a waterproofing medium. It is made of polyester geo-textile and elastomeric bitumen. It is available in 3mm to 5.6 mm thickness. It is not necessary to put soil or compost on this medium. It is UV resistant and can be used from-40 to 55 degrees Celsius. This Puncture Resistant,
It's flexible. This medium is easy to use and can be used as lining for all types of irrigation canals in the water resources department. This medium can be used as a waterproof sheet on the upstream side of the dam as well as for waterproofing the fields.
The use of Bituminous Geomembrane (BGM) technology:
With the use of this technology, the burrowing animals can not puncture the canal, the grass/ weeds can not grow on the surface of the canal, the leakage of the canal is reduced by 100%

Strength will increase. Generally in the normal condition the erosion of the soil in the sloping condition of the canal is reduced to a great extent, the cost to the government for keeping the canal in good condition is reduced. During the rainy season, the moisture content in the dam decreases, thereby reducing soil erosion.
This technology is waterproofed by using a combination of Polyester Geo Textile and Elastomeric Bitumen. As a result, the life expectancy and the carrying capacity of the canal are increased.
3.This technology is temperature resistant, tear resistant, fuel and oil chemical resistant, puncture resistant, bioturbation resistant, so that the canal remains in good condition and increases its life.
4. The use of this technology is cost effective as compared to the cost involved in lining the canal with cement concrete.
Recommendations of the Committee: Powered Committee on Adaptation of Innovative Technologies In its sixth meeting, the Committee on Bituminous Geo Membrane (BGM) Technology recommended that a detailed report on the use of BGM technology for the left canal of Pench Project and its efficiency and reduced leakage in the canal due to its use should be taken from Vidarbha Irrigation Development Corporation. In line with this, Vidarbha Irrigation Development Corporation, Nagpur has submitted a technology pilot based on practical application experience, feedback on utility and efficiency of the product, which is as follows: Due to application of Bituminous Geo Membrane (BGM) technology to a portion of the screw project on the left canal, burrowing animals cannot puncture the canal, grass/ weeds cannot grow on the surface of the canal, canal seepage is reduced by 100% and robustness is increased. Generally in the normal condition the erosion of the soil in the sloping condition of the canal is reduced to a great extent, the cost to the government for keeping the canal in good condition is reduced. It has been observed that during the rainy season, the moisture content in the dam decreases, thereby reducing soil erosion, increasing the life and carrying capacity of the canal while keeping it in good condition, and this technology is economically viable.
Based on the recommendation of the empowered committee formed to adopt innovative technologies and the report received from the Vidarbha Irrigation Development Corporation, the government was considering issuing the following circular.
