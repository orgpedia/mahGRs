Conceptual carrying capacity in parts (1911 910) is 23.03 cumecs (813.30 cusecs). The left-hand side
The canal has its own irrigation area of 2631. Oyster right from No. 2/750
The canal starts at, the carrying capacity of the right canal is 8. 32 cumecs (294 cusecs) with an irrigation area of.

As a result, 175.83 DLGM (6.21 AUF) of water is released into the Yedgamb Dam.
The carrying capacity of the Oyster Left Canal has been reduced at many places. at the site of deep excavation
The banks of the canal have been damaged by the collapse. Constant water damage to the lining from the filling.
It's leaking. Drainage - Damaged by the water in the drain as well as the high load on it.

The rocks have fallen and the fountains have been filled. The canal has broken several times so far at such places.
The left canal of the egg has to be continued for more than six months. sister expenditure by way of leakage and
Evaporation results in the loss of 10 to 40 percent of water near Jabal and ultimately the total in the poultry plant.
This has a serious impact on irrigation efficiency. While the Kukdi plant is under irrigation, one of the
Irrigation of the left canal has to be stopped if the structure is broken or the filling section is broken. As well as the farmers
There is a high risk of extensive damage to agricultural goods or farm land, and of loss of life.
After completion of these works, 36,524 oysters depended on the left canal. for the irrigation sector.
The water will be supplied at full capacity and the Kukdi left canal will be navigable through Yedgaon Dam 168112.
