New Administration Building, 6th Floor,
Madam Kama Marg, Martyr Rajguru Chowk,
Mantralaya, Mumbai - 400 032.
Date: 17.02.2025
The Proposal: -
As many as 59 sub-irrigation schemes are operational in the state through the Water Resources Department, which have created an irrigation potential of about 58.22 lakh hectares and 74 projects are under construction, which will create an irrigation potential of 8.15 lakh hectares.
Choosing a pump is a very important skill when planning a run-off irrigation scheme. Different types of pumps are available depending on the functioning of the Water Resources Department. For example: Vertical Turbine Pump, Submersible Pump, Horizontal Split Case Pump 6. Also, the efficiency, reliability, and cost-effectiveness of the scheme depend on the pump selection. Therefore, pump selection is expected to be done very carefully. While the choice of pump is primarily related to mechanical components, it also relates to electrical and architectural components. It was under the consideration of the government to constitute a comprehensive committee to decide on the detailed criteria and guidelines for the selection of sabh pumps.
The Government's Decisions:
The following Committee is being constituted by this Government to lay down the detailed criteria and guidelines for pump selection for irrigation schemes: -
