Preamble: Reference 1 was received that expenditure for expansion and improvement/ special repair works of projects in the Water Resources Department should be limited to 2% of the annual outlay sanctioned to each Development Corporation area.
2% for extension improvement/ special repairs of transferred projects for irrigation management is very low, resulting in loss of dam safety, water cost, reduction in irrigation project efficiency etc.

GOVERNMENT DECISIONS: 1. The Government is permitting expenditure under the schemes sanctioned to each region by the Irrigation Development Corporation for works under the head of Extension and Improvement/ Special Repair of projects under the control of the Water Resources Department within a limit of 10% of the sanctioned outlay.

(3) Since the above funds made available for extension and improvement/ special amendment will be transferred from the fund of the project approved by the Legislature, the sanctity of the utilization of the fund must be at par with the Legislature.
Therefore, before making the above expenditure, the proposal for the work-wise expenditure of expansion and improvement/ special repair works, determining the priority, etc. should be submitted to the Government for administrative approval after approval in the Governing Body of the Corporation.
