GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.:-BCCINA-2019/ (153/19)/ CC (DHO)
Ministry, Mumbai- 400 032.
Date: 23.05.2019
Reference:- 1) Government Resolution No. Narrow 2007/ (13-0711)/ CE (Works), Dy. His letter No. MANIPRA/ 2018/ Q& A Parameters/ 316, D. 18/4/2019
Preamble: Section 11 (d) of the MANIPRA Act, 2005 provides for fixing of wholesale water rates for different categories to reflect the full recovery of the cost of operation and maintenance of irrigation projects.
Considering the time taken at various stages of the rate determination process, the work of determining the criteria for fixing the wholesale water rate (2020-2023) as per section 11 (d) and 11 (p) of the MANIPRA Act is being taken up by MANIPRA with immediate effect.
In this, the location of the parameter of operation and maintenance cost is important. It has been found during the assessment of rates from 2017 to 2020 that the existing parameters for maintenance of irrigation projects issued under Section 1 are not adequate. As a result, standards need to be improved.
The Government was considering the constitution of a committee to improve the standards of maintenance and repair of irrigation projects in the Water Resources Department and to prepare a methodology and tariff for determining basin-wise water rates.
Government's decision:
A committee has been formed to decide on the policy.
