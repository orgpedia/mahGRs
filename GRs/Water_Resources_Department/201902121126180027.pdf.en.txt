The Proposal:
In order to increase irrigation, the state government has decided to offer irrigation to the farmers' fields through closed pipes instead of the existing gravity canal irrigation in the state. Accordingly, the government has a policy to make optimum use of available water for agriculture. Therefore, irrigation is a priority. This will also help in reducing water wastage. The Centre had set a target of 20 per cent increase in water use efficiency by 2017 and urged the state governments to take measures accordingly. Accordingly, the Government has decided to frame a policy on the Pipeline Distribution System. Since water use in agriculture is significant, it is important to prioritize increasing water use efficiency in agriculture. The Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority (MWRRA) has also issued an order in this regard. As per the notification dated 12-06-2015, it has been made mandatory to provide water through micro-irrigation to perennial crops from the year 2019.
At present, the Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran's tariff list is being used for the water distribution system of the Water Resources Department. The nature of work in the water resources department and Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran is different. Therefore, it is impossible to solve all the problems of the distribution system of the departments by using the tariff list of the Maharashtra Life Authority. Therefore, there is a need to have a separate tariff list for the pipe distribution system of the Water Resources Department.
Government Order No. Rate List 2316/ (213/2016)/ LPA-2, Dy. Under 29/08/2016, a Committee was constituted under the Chairmanship of Chief Engineer (V.P.), Amravati to decide the tariff, specifications and concept of the tube distribution system. The Government gave a copy of the report of the distribution system submitted to the Government to the Common Rating Committee. As per the Government letter dated 31/08/2017, the Committee has made a provision for the Maharashtra Life Authority to be listed on the common list.

At present, the use of tube distribution system has increased in the water resources department and it is very important to include their rates and tariffs in the common tariff list immediately. Therefore, the matter of fixing the tariff, rates, specifications and concepts for the tube distribution system and including it in the common tariff list was under the consideration of the Government. Also, the government was considering the appointment of a high-level technical committee to standardize the concepts and specifications used for the tube distribution system.
Government's decision:
