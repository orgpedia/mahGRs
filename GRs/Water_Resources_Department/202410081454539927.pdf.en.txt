Government Resolution No. HEP 2022/CR125.2022/HP
Mantralaya, Mumbai 400032
Dated: 08.10.2024
Ref. : Govt. Resolution No. PVT 1204/(160/2004)/HP, dt.15.09.2005.
1) Preamble:
Power 1s a critical infrastructure on which the socio-economic development of the
country depends. The growth of the economy and its global competitiveness
hinges on the availability of reliable and quality power at competitive rates.
Therefore, it 1s imperative that electricity 15 made available at globally competitive
cost.
Further, hydroelectric Power generation has many well recognised advantages. It is
environmentally clean and renewable energy source with high degree of
operational flexibility and reliability. The importance of the hydropower has
further increased with the increased penetration of Wind and Solar power in the
energy basket. Having recognised distinct advantages of the hydropower,
Government of Maharashtra (GoM) has laid maximum emphasis on the full
development of its available hydro potential.
Electricity Act 2003 (EA, 2003) has come into force since 10.06.2003. It has
delicenced the generation and permitted direct commercial relationship between
Developer and Consumer/Trader. EA, 2003 has awarded Developers a right to
Open Access to State Transmission Utilities (STUs) for the purpose of
wheeling/transmission electricity. After the enactment of EA, 2003, Government
of Maharashtra, Water Resources Department (GOMWRD) announced its policy
for development of Small Hydro Projects (SHPs) through Public Private

Government Resolution No.: 2022/CR125.2022/HP HEP
Partnership (PPP) on September 15, 2005 (Previous Policy). Under this policy, 40
projects, with total installed capacity of 160.45 MW have been completed and 8
projects with capacity of 9.30 MW are in progress till date. Private investment to
the tune of Rs. 1000 crores have been pumped in the SHP sector. Further, these
projects are generating revenue, on perpetual basis, in the form of water royalty
charges and land lease charges.
Having recognised the inherent strengths of private sector such as easy access to
the state-of-art technology, better managerial skill and comparatively faster
decision making which can benefit for timely completion of the projects,
GoMWRD has decided to continue to develop SHPs through PPP.
However, considering the experience gathered and feedback received from
stakeholders, experts in the field, in last 16 years and various legislative as well
as regulatory reforms, the proposal of reviewing the earlier policy was under the
consideration of GOMWRD. Accordingly, the committee of experts was
constituted in formulating a comprehensive draft of the policy document, for
development of SHPs through PPP. The committee has submitted a comprehensive
draft policy document to the State Government. On this background GOMWRD is
pleased to declare this policy for development of Small Hydro Project (SHPs) / co-
Located hydro solar hybrid policy in the state through PPP on Build, Operate &
Transfer (BOT) basis.
2) Relevant Legal Provisions:
a) Government of Maharashtra, through various enactments has constituted five
Irrigation Development Corporations (IDC) in the State viz.
e Maharashtra Krishna Valley Development Corporation; (MAHARASHTRA ACT No. XV of 1996).
e Vidarbha Irrigation Development Corporation; (MAHARASHTRA ACT No.
XXVI of 1997).
e Godavari Marathwada Irrigation Development Corporation; (MAHARASHTRA ACT No. XXIII of 1998).
e Tapi Irrigation Development Corporation; (MAHARASHTRA ACT No. IV of 1998).
e Konkan Irrigation Development Corporation; (MAHARASHTRA ACT No. III of 1998).

Government Resolution No.: 2022/CR125.2022/HP HEP
As per the provisions in Section 15 of the respective IDC Acts, all the projects
and assets including hydroelectric projects, situated in the area of jurisdiction of
these [DCs, earlier vested with the State Government have been transferred to
the respective IDCs.
b) Further, Section 18 of these IDC Acts empowers the respective IDC to plan,
investigate, design, construct and manage, promote and operate schemes for the
generation of hydroelectric projects. These IDCs are also empowered to invite
bids/offers for the purpose of all the activities of the Corporations, promote
participation of any person or body for designing and management of
hydroelectric projects.
Thus, respective IDCs, by virtue of statutory provisions have right to harness the
natural resources in its jurisdiction and earn revenue from it.
c) EA, 2003 has de-licensed the generation of electricity. Section 7, of the EA,
2003 specifies that any generating company may establish, operate and maintain
a generating station without obtaining a license under this Act, if 1t complies
with the technical standards relating to connectivity with the grid referred to in
Clause (b) of the Section 73 of EA, 2003.
d) Government of India, Ministry of Power, vide Office Memorandum F. NO.
15/2/2016-H-I(Pt) dated March 8, 2019 has taken certain measures to promote
hydropower sector. In tariff rationalisation measures for bringing down
hydropower tariff useful project life 1s increased to 40 years. Subsequently,
Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC), in its (Terms and
Conditions for Tariff Determination from RE Sources) Regulation, 2020 has
increased the useful life of SHP from 35 years to 40 years.
3) Objectives of the Policy:
The State Government intends to achieve following objectives through this Policy:
a) to harness the renewable SHP potential with the help of private sector;
