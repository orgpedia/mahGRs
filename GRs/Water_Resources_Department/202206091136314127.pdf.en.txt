Introduction: Under the five Irrigation Development Corporations under the Water Resources Department, sub-irrigation schemes have been set up to provide irrigation facilities to farmers in drought prone and remote areas. A large amount of electricity is required for irrigation. Farmers should be provided electricity at reasonable rates to meet their water needs.
Inadequate fuel supply and rising power tariff in conventional power generation projects are adversely impacting the operation of lift irrigation schemes. Therefore, it will be possible to implement the utility of sub-irrigation schemes by using the available land available with the Water Resources Department for setting up captive solar power plants. Accordingly, development of pilot solar power project for Mhaisal lift irrigation scheme with funding from KFW, Germany is in progress.
It was under the consideration of the government to form a committee of expert officers working in the government service in the area to study the captive solar power plant construction and related matters on the open land available with the Water Resources Department for sub-irrigation schemes as well as on the lands adjacent to the project.
Government Decision: In accordance with the above proposal, a committee is being constituted to study the construction of captive solar power plants and related matters on the open lands available with the Water Resources Department for the sub-irrigation schemes in the state and the details regarding the composition, members of the committee, tenure, duration and other aspects are as follows:
