Introduction: Mula Irrigation Project has two major canals namely Mula Right Bank Canal and Mula Left Bank Canal. The original right bank canal is 52 km long and was completed in 1972-73. The projected water carrying capacity from the origin is 1650 cusecs. The water management of the entire benefit area of the Mula Dam project has been transferred to the Water Utilization Agency since 2006. All water use agencies are functional and water is being metered as per demand at government rates.
