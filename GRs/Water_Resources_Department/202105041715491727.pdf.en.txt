the prelude
The project is located on the Kanheri river near Dahikute village in Malegaon taluka of Nashik district. The construction of the earthen dam of this project was completed in the year 1975. The useful water storage is 2.90 D.L.H.M and irrigated area is 648. The project is located in the districts of Jalukbari, Jalukbari and Devarpade of Malegaon taluka. The length of the canal is 8.0 km. On the right canal there are 14 small direct discharges and 1 distributary.
As the right canal of the Dahikute Minor Irrigation Project passes through rocky and marshy land throughout its length, 80 to 90 per cent of the water is lost during the rotation period. As a result, in the last five years, only 136 irrigation has been done.
The right canal of the Dahikute project is from km 0.00 to km. 6.54 mm water leakage resistance rotation
Improving the carrying capacity of the canal by reducing the duration of irrigation in the tail-end areas of the project
An enclosed duct system has been proposed to restore the area. The project
648 after completion of work. Irrigation will be restored.
