Government Resolution No. Narrow- 2021/ Q. No. 25/21/ A (Rs. And why )
Madam Cama Marg, Hutatma Rajguru Chowk,
Ministry, Mumbai- 400 032.
Date of release: June 4, 2021
The background:
1.1 The Water Resources Department has been entrusted with the responsibility of planning and executing the project in time and at a reasonable cost to meet the present and future requirements of water required for agriculture, irrigation, drinking water and industry in the State of Maharashtra.
1.2 The most important challenge before the Water Resources Department is that 278 projects worth Rs. 1.08 lakh crore are under construction.
The project is to be completed in the next 3-5 years, creating an additional irrigation potential of 26.89 lakh hectares (33% of total irrigation potential). The under construction project will cater to the growing urbanization, drinking water needs of the people in rural areas, as well as water needs for industry, besides agriculture. Accordingly, the department has set several targets. These include 166 under construction projects to be completed by 2021-24, thereby creating 78 TMC additional water storage and irrigation potential of 11.74 lakh hectares, Gosikhurd National Project to be completed by December, 2023, thereby creating irrigation potential of 2.51 lakh hectares, 97 projects to be completed at a cost of Rs 39,908 crore in 2021-23 to be approved by Forest Department and thereby creating irrigation potential of 12.26 lakh hectares, 13 projects to be completed in 2021-22 to create irrigation potential of 1.46 lakh hectares (under Dam Restoration and Improvement Programme Phase-II), 140 dams to be constructed at a cost of Rs 965.85 crore
The Wainganga-Nalganga river link project will connect six districts of Vidarbha (Nagpur, Wardha,

It is planned to provide relief to 11.33 lakh population by creating 3.71 lakh irrigation capacity in 15 talukas of Amravati, Yavatmal, Akola and Buldhana. The Department also aims to focus on exploring alternative means of financing for timely completion of ongoing projects and taking up new projects, establishing new project oriented mechanisms etc.
1.3 In order to achieve the above objective, the Department has completed the process of analysing the bottlenecks in the planning and execution of the project through the consultancy firm M/ s KPMG and preparing the proposals for structural, strategic and procedural improvements required to remove the bottlenecks. In the last few months, project review meetings and brainstorming workshops have been held with experts and senior officials in the field. The main constraints are lack of standard formats in the process, lack of project-oriented operations/ business processes due to non-use of project planning management as well as risk assessment and remediation approach, lack of time to undertake Business Process Review& Re-engineering, etc. To remove these bottlenecks and to resolve the issues related to administrative/ revised administrative approval proposals pending for years, proposals for sanction of additional liabilities, forest and environment clearances, Central Water Commission clearances, departmental vacancies, promotions and departmental enquiry proposals, etc., it has been suggested that the departments should implement the Integrated Fast Track Approval Process in mission mode. The Water Resources Department is essentially a project-centric department and based on the motto- Prioritise the project- the consultancy has submitted a report for setting up the Project First Cell.
Considering all the above and in accordance with the report submitted by the consultancy, the matter of setting up the first phase of the project was under the consideration of the government.
