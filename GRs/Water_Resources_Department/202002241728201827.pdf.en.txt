1.0 Introduction: Irrigation has been started in the Neera basin since 130 years ago. In 1889, an S-shaped dam was built on the Yelavandi river, a tributary of the Nira, at Bhatghar and a pickup weir was constructed downstream at Veer, 27 km away. From that pickup weir, the Nira Dawa canal was constructed to irrigate the left bank of the Nira river in Pune district. In the first phase, the carrying capacity of the Nera-Dawa canal was envisaged at 12.88 cusecs (455 cusecs), benefiting 60656 households on the Nera-Left canal. Irrigation area and 68767 cultivable area were planned.
During the second phase from 1912 to 1926, the LIyod dam at Bhatghar was constructed with a capacity of 23.402 tmcft, during the same period the Nera right canal was constructed from the Veer pickup weir and at that time the carrying capacity of the Nera left canal was increased to 20.39 cumecs (720 cusecs). From Veer Pickup Weir, there is a right canal (169 km) and a left canal (161 km). ) There are two ways.
The construction of the canal was completed between 1917 and 1935. Subsequently, from 1954 to 1962, a storage dam was constructed at Vir and the carrying capacity of the existing Nira Right Canal was increased by 31.15 cumecs (1100 cusecs) to 35120 cusecs. Irrigation was planned in the area. Then there's the more 40320 on the Nera right canal. canal for profit area

The carrying capacity was increased to 42.48 cumecs (1500 cusecs). The present carrying capacity of the right canal is 1500 cusecs and the cultivable area is 181266. And the irrigation capacity is 65606. That's so much.
The study was conducted on the excess water discharged from the Veer Dam effluent over a period of 24 years from 1965 to 1988. According to this study, the rate of 75 percent reliability at the Veer Dam site was 365 Dalghami. Even after the planned utilization of 239 Dalghamis in the Niru project, 123 Dalghamis were still available. In 1989, the government gave administrative approval to the proposal for modernization of Nir Dawa canal to increase the carrying capacity of Nir Dawa canal to meet the irrigation needs of standing crops on Nir Dawa canal and to fill the Shetfal lake by using 51 Dalghami water (90% reliability) in the kharif season. The government had earlier approved to increase the carrying capacity of the left canal from 720 cusecs to 945 cusecs (i.e. 26.76 cumecs).
The benefit area of the left canal comes under Baramati, Purandar and Indapur taluks. There are a total of 59 distributaries on the left canal. The area up to 46 is perennial and beyond that Indapur area is non-evergreen. The right bank canal is located in Malshiras, Pandharpur and Sangola taluks of Solapur district and Phaltan and Khandala talukas of Satara district. On the right side of the canal. I'm at branch number 150 (mile 93). The area up to 2 km is perennial and the area up to 169 km in Pandharpur and Sangola taluks beyond that is non-evergreen.
4. Nira Deoghar Dam was completed in 2007 and 11.73 TMC of useful water has been created and 0.70 TMC of water was created in Gunjavani Dam till 2007. Considering the fact that the canal works of these two projects are incomplete, the total water cannot be used in their planned area of benefit, the government has decided to use 60 percent of the water available in these two dams for the Nera Dawa canal and 40 percent for the Nera Dawa canal. 4.4.2007. The period of approval was from 4/04/2007 to 3/04/2012. Approval is granted for the next five years. It was extended from 4/04/2012 to 3/04/2017. After the expiry of this period, till 2019, the canal advisory committee was allocating water for Niradawa and Right Canal in the ratio of 60:40.
The proposal for extension of water allocation to Nira Deoghar and Gunjavani dams from Maharashtra Krishna Valley Development Corporation, Pune was submitted to the government at the corporation level as the deadline has expired. In this regard, a letter from the Government Water Resources Department No. 2013/ (635/13)/ c. V. (d. As on 12.06.2019, the unutilized water of Nira Deoghar Dam will be diverted to the canal and distribution system of Nira Deoghar Project for irrigation and drinking purposes through the Nira Right Canal lift irrigation scheme in the notified benefit area of Nira Deoghar Dam.

GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: SRIKH- 2013/ PR. NO. 635/ SINVYA (POLICY)
This alternative arrangement has been approved till the works are completed and full utilization of water is started in the planned benefit area. However, there is no provision of drinking water.
6. Canal clearance permits have been issued within the canal limits at the beginning of the canal. Since the discharge from the sub-irrigation schemes is being used to reduce the discharge from the canal for irrigation purposes and there is disruption/ difficulty in irrigation, there is a need to restrict the discharge to control the excess water consumption of the sanctioned sub-schemes during the rotation period and to provide the required discharge for irrigation in tail-end areas. At present, the tail area does not get the required discharge unless a lifting ban is imposed on the main canal. Further, if fresh sanction is accorded to the sub-irrigation schemes in the benefit area of Deoghar project through Nira Ulwa canal, it will be difficult to provide discharge for irrigation in tail-end area of Nira Right Canal and it is likely to create huge problems.
7. Accordingly, considering the details of the area sanctioned for irrigation in the benefit area of Deoghar project without Nira right canal and the area permissible for drip and drip irrigation on Nira right canal, the expenditure incurred and the balance area, it was under consideration of the Government to allocate the unutilized water of Deoghar and Gunjavani project on temporary basis on equitable basis to the benefit area of Nira left and right canal.
The allocation shall be such that the water available in all the four (4) dams of the Nira sub-basin shall be equal to the area soaked per hectare or per cubic metre in the benefit area (ICA) of both the canals.
However, in doing so, the water available to the original projects as per the approved project report will remain the same and only the unutilized water of the incomplete projects will be reallocated. Equal allocation per hectare to the Benefit Area (ICA) of both the canals will make the allocation equitable to the farmers of the beneficiary areas of both the projects. 21, d. Meeting of the Committee of Ministers held on 22nd April, 2011. Approved on 19/02/2020
Decision of the Government: (1) As the canal distribution system of Nira Deoghar and Gunjavani dams is incomplete, the remaining water should be distributed on equitable basis to the benefit areas of Nira Right Canal and Nira Left Canal as per the provisions of the Maharashtra Water Resources Act, 2005.
(2) The unutilized water of Nira Deoghar and Gunjavani dams in that year, taking into account the project water planning and needs of those projects, should be used for irrigation category under sectoral allocation in the proportion of Nira Dawa Canal (55%) and Nira Dawa Canal (45%).

(3) This principle of equitable distribution of unutilized wastewater shall continue to apply for the period up to the completion of the utilization of irrigation from the canal distribution system of Deoghar and Gunjavani project.
(4) The said decision shall be reviewed by an Act to amend the Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority Act, 2005 (Maharashtra Act No. 21) shall be made in accordance with the provisions of section 16 (a) (1).
