No. 785/13)/ Simvya (Works), Dy. 01/08/2019 Preamble: Shankarrao Chavan Vishnupuri Project, T.G. Nanded The lowest level of the 11 dams on Godavari River under Part-II of the scheme has been constructed in Gangakhed Taluka on Godavari River in Parbhani District under Godavari Irrigation Development Corporation. The catchment area of the project is 1400 sq km and the irrigation potential of the project is 1705. The total live water storage available in the project is 11.35 Dalhousie and the total live water storage available is 10.06 Dalhousie, 11.15 Dalhousie and 1.29 Dalhousie. The length of the dam is 231.50 m. The maximum height is 11.58 m. That's so much.
Shankarrao Chavan Vishnupuri Project, T.G. Nanded, includes a dam on the Godavari River under Part-II of the scheme, which includes a low level dam. As per the administrative sanction plan of the scheme, out of 11 embankments in the embankment chain, 9 embankments were proposed to be fitted with automatic and 2 embankments with vertical lift gates. However, in the wake of the flood situation of August, 2006. In the Executive Committee meeting held on 26/9/2006, it was approved to install vertical lifting gates in all the embankments.
However, it was decided and approved in the executive committee meeting dated 24/1/2007 to maintain automatic gates on a major river like Godavari.
If the experiment is successful, the automatic gates will be automated during floods, saving on cost and manpower. However, during the period of heavy rainfall in 2012 and September 2016, the flood situation has caused damage to the lower level of the embankment by a suction type automatic. Considering the experience of 2012 and September 2016, a detailed report has been submitted that automatic gates of Godbole type are not suitable for this dam. Considering the experience of 2012 and 2016, the efficiency of automatic gates was not seen in the flood situation of Godavari river.
