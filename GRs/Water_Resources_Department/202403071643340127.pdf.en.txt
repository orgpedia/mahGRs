The Proposal: -
A big project. The Nandgaon District Nashik Sadar Project was completed in 1969.
It has been transferred to irrigation management in 1970. The four main canals under the Girna project
It includes the Panjan Dawa Canal, which starts near the village of Panjan on the left side of the mill project. The length of the Panjan Left Canal is 53.20 km and its projected carrying capacity is 7.093 cumecs.
That's so much. The canal connects Malegaon, Dhule, Bhadgaon and Chalisgaon in Nashik and Jalgaon districts.
The taluks benefit. A total of 12141 areas are irrigated by the Panjan Left Canal. The project's
It has been 49 years since the construction of the canal was completed and the irrigation period is plagued with a lot of difficulties. The proposed carrying capacity of the five-lane left main canal is 250 cusecs and the canal is only
It was running at 100 cusecs. Distribution No.3, 3A, and 6 on the five left canals in the irrigation cycle
The siphon, HPD and aqueducts in the city, as well as the old UC Lining, which has been repaired and repaired in the past, are leaking heavily. Also, water is being wasted in large quantities due to erosion in the neighbouring fields.
Crops are getting damaged due to waterlogging and the farm land is getting submerged due to continuous waterlogging.
Water has been lost due to frequent bursting of the filler due to leakage of distributaries No. 3, 3A, and 6 on Panjan Left Canal. As a result, the irrigation cycle of the canal increased, leading to distributions No. 3, 3A, and 6.
Corrections are needed.
Farmers in the Chalisgaon and Bhadgaon areas do not have access to water during the irrigation period.
The decline in farmers' income leads to depression and resentment / grievances of the farmers.
You have to face it. Hence, the repair of various constructions (siphons, HPD and aqueducts) in Divisions No. 3, 3A, and 6 on the Panjan Left Canal, as well as the filling repairs and the replacement of the old UC Lining done earlier.
A new lining has been proposed. This will help in restoring the carrying capacity of the distributors.
Also, there will be no loss of agriculture to the nearby farmers by stopping the water leakage from the distribution.
Also, filling repairs are also going to reduce the chances of a recent delivery leak.
