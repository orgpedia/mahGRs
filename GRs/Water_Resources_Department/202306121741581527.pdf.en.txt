Introduction: A dam was constructed on the Mula river near Rahuri village in Rahuri taluka in 1974 and the available water during the rainy season is being supplied to irrigation through the right and left canals. The original left canal was built in 1974 and major repairs have not been made since. While irrigating through canals and distributaries, there is a large amount of leakage from the construction, which increases the transportation cost and disrupts irrigation management.
At present, the canal is being irrigated by the beneficiaries and the benefit area is being irrigated as per the Irrigation Act, 2005 by establishing 28 Small Market Level Water Utilization Societies. However, as the construction works on the main canal and the Vitarika are not being repaired by the main contractor, the Vitarika Level Water Utilization Agency and the Canal Level Water Utilization Agency are not ready to transfer the works. Therefore, there is a need to repair the main structure on the Mula-Dawa canal, repair the insulators, repair the alignment and repair the embankment where necessary, according to the regional situation. After the completion of this work, an area of 2117 hectares will be restored. It was 16/560 C.E. The matter of granting administrative approval to the proposed budget under the special amendment in I.M. was under consideration of the government. Following this, the government decided:
