Government Resolution No: Gunimam-2014/ P.S. No.57/ N.V.S.3
9.0 Material inspection:
9.1 Copies of the approved specifications for the various construction components shall be made available to the concerned Quality Control Engineer as well as to the Engineer of the Construction Cell as well as to the Engineer of the Contractor and all the Field Supervisors for day-to-day work before the commencement of the construction of the component at the field location.
9.2 The mine selected for the construction material shall be subject to approval of the Executive Engineer. Other materials required for construction. The work items like Vajrachurna, Iron Ore, Brick, Sand, Clay, Stone, Mixed Concepts, Different Types of Pipes, etc. should be initially tested in the laboratory of Quality Control Room under Water Resources Department or under MERY, Nashik or in a private laboratory (NABL certified). Thereafter, during the construction phase, the material shall be tested in a laboratory under the Quality Control Board in the Water Resources Department or in a laboratory accredited by the Quality Control Board or NABL (National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories) accredited laboratory. Also, the various instruments used for testing need to be calibrated from time to time (according to the frequency specified in the corresponding Indian standard).
As per the prescribed frequency, 80% of the total tests required for construction shall be conducted by this building control room and the remaining 20% shall be conducted by or in the presence of this quality control room. Also, the results of the test conducted by the points control room will be binding on the construction room.
If there is a change in the mining of materials during the construction period, appropriate measures must be taken by conducting all quality control tests of the materials in the new mine, comparing them with the original design assumptions.
No construction materials should be used.
9.3 If it is found after testing the construction material that a lighter material is being used in the work area, it will be the responsibility of the construction engineer to remove the lighter material and use suitable and better quality material.
If required, construction engineers should obtain quality control test results from two to three other laboratories, rather than relying on a single laboratory, so that it is possible to confirm by ensuring that the materials used are of proper quality.
9.4 Specific Material Testing:- There is no objection to get the specific material test or any specific test (which is not available with Quality Control Room/ MARI Nashik) done from a private reputed laboratory (NABL certified). Also, the quality reports of such specific materials should be obtained from the manufacturers.

# Page 10
Government Resolution No: Gunimam-2014/ P.S. No.57/ N.V.S.3
Construction engineers should use materials only if they have verified the results of these tests and are satisfied. For this, the information about the laboratories available for testing such specific materials
It should be determined before starting work (e.g. Tests on Elastomeric Bearing Pads, Neoprene materials for joints, sealants, epoxy chemicals, various pipes).
10.0 Conductive work:
10.1 In IS 456" Mix designed earlier not earlier to one year may be considered"
Sufficient for later work provided there is no change in sources and the quality of the material. This is how it is described. It is mandatory to follow the above-mentioned procedure in order to obtain a mix design. Nominal mix can be used only for tenders where the volume of the mixer is up to 150 cum and the work is in one place. However, for tenders involving works of dispersed nature having aggregate compaction volume of more than 150 cubic metres, it will be mandatory to go for mix design.
Components must be used only by weight. At present, automated digitally controlled batching and mixing plants of different capacities are available. Therefore, such batching plate should be included in the tender. Digital batching and mixing
Online printer facility should be available in the plant. The batching platform should have the facility to provide batch-wise computerized information in print form. The batching plant should be certified by the Quality Council of India (QCI), Delhi.
10.2. It is necessary to use suitable component materials to produce a durable, leak resistant and required density. The main component of the compressor is gravel and it should be well graded. Sand and gravel should be properly graded. The strength and porosity of the compressor depends on the water-cement coefficient. Therefore, there should be proper control over the water-cement coefficient.
10.3 The engineers of the construction department are required to send the necessary information and materials required for the mixed concept to the quality control laboratory at least six weeks before the commencement of construction. Along with this, assumptions should be made based on the degree of control for the mixed concept and the data of the previous work. After receiving this information from the construction department, the mixed concept will be done by the quality control room.
The mixed concept recommended by the quality control rooms should be used only after obtaining the approval of the Superintending Engineer, Board of Construction.
As per Indian Standard 456, the acceptance criteria of the moderator should be checked. Addendum No. 10 provides information about the conciliation acceptance criteria.

Government Resolution No: Gunimam-2014/ P.S. No.57/ N.V.S.3
10.4 CORE TEST:- The core of the conductor should be tested to check the density, strength, permeability and thickness of the conductor (in canal lining).
10.5 USE OF MINERAL ADMISSIONS: Components which are important for long-term durability and permeability (e.g. mass concrete). fly ash is required. The use of fly ash helps in reducing the shrinkage cracks due to heat generated by the hydration process of the cement.
The decision on whether or not to use the sub-components in the construction work and what type of sub-components are required should be taken at the level of the executive engineer of the construction department.
The quality control system should be made aware of this when planning the mix.
10.6 CENTURING AND FRAMEWORK FORMWORK (IS 14687): Formwork is an important component in the construction process and plays a major role in the process of construction. The mold and support work allows to maintain the speed, safety and quality of work. A template is a temporary structure. Till the time the instrument does not get its own strength, it does the work of providing support and containment to the instrument.
The construction includes moulding and sheathing.
With the speed with which the technology of corrosive composting has developed, this technology of using molding is also developing. Due to the strong molding, the density of the compressor also increases.
The structure and foundation should be stable and durable. They must be able to produce a good surface of the condenser.
Construction engineers must conceptualize and approve the work.
The use of wooden moldings should not be allowed. For acro shutter iron plate and iron pipe should be used.
It is the responsibility of the construction engineer to incorporate the steel in the construction according to the structural stability of the structure as well as the dimensions and design of the steel.
The engineers of the quality control room will check the general layout of the base and check works, inspect the surface and record their feedback.
For important construction on the canal (e.g. Jal Setu, Vimochak, Ladimori etc. ) Prepare the moulds according to their size and use them for construction.
The quality, durability and serviceability of the work depends on the quality of the work.

Government Resolution No: Gunimam-2014/ P.S. No.57/ N.V.S.3
Sample of O.K. Card of Iron ingot and check work along with Annexure No. 11 is given. This model should be finalized at the level of Executive Engineer of the construction room by making changes in the plan as per the requirement and the actual work of the contractor should be taken up only after the corresponding OK card is issued from the level of Deputy Engineer of the construction room.
10.7 Curing: After water is added to form the compressor, cement combines with water to absorb the heat generated.
The process of retaining water in the refrigerant is called curing.
The following methods are used for the preparation of the composition:
1) Cover the surface of the condenser with an impermeable material.
24) Keeping the surface of the condenser constantly and continuously wet, keeping the surface of the condenser moist increases the strength of the condenser.
For masonry and construction work, it is necessary to have a continuous and continuous training system by mechanical methods.
3. At present, there are many chemical methods available for processing compost. After spraying and drying the surface of the compressor, an impermeable coating is formed and the water content in the compressor is reduced.
The decision as to which of the above various methods should be used should be taken by the competent authority of the construction department as per the field conditions.
11.0 Soil:
11.1 Mines:- A mine map should be prepared for the filling work. Before starting the work, is there enough material available in the mine? It is also mandatory for the mine to be approved by the competent authority of the construction department after checking whether the quality control tests of the materials in the mine pass the conceptual parameters assumed for the concept.
If the properties of the available material are different from the hypotheses, then the available material needs to be re-conceptualized according to the properties. (Use of locally available materials should be considered for conceptualization.) 11.2 RECORD TESTS: The soil work should be subjected to periodic record tests. The record test results should be compared with the hypotheses proposed and if they do not match, they should be re-conceptualized as per requirement.
Records of all tests conducted should be preserved and analyzed in accordance with the concept.

Government Resolution No: Gunimam-2014/ P.S. No.57/ N.V.S.3
Importance and use of record tests along with Annexure No. This is explained in 12.
11.3 Filling: While filling, the layers of core and shell filling should be done simultaneously.
(When pressing the filler, a layer of core filler should always be on top of the shell filler) The work of the filler should be done by forming a union on the perpendicular length to ensure that the horizontal joint is not formed.
11.4 Drains and Filters: The tests should ensure that the materials used for draining and draining meet the specified specifications.
Before the work of L-Drains and Cross Drain, working drawings should be prepared.
Proper care should be taken when working with an inclined filter.
Be careful not to mix the filling material and the filling material together.
The pitching work should be done as per the tender specification. The size, weight and density of the stones used for the ashtray should be as per the specifications.
12.0 Inventory of materials and their use in construction
the recording.
Controlling the use of materials is a kind of quality assurance. In the present scenario, most of the materials are purchased from contractors. (Schedule A is unique.) All important materials brought to the worksite by the contractor (e.g. The construction sector engineers are responsible for keeping track of the records (cement, iron ore, chemicals, different types of pipes, specific materials, etc.) submitted by the contractor from time to time. Also these records need to be preserved by the construction engineers.
Records of the use of materials brought to the work site and the actual work done
Quantity is an important factor in determining the quality of work. It is the responsibility of the construction engineer to verify the authenticity of the matter.
Records of the utilization of machinery and manpower must also be obtained from the contractor and verified by the engineers of the construction department.
Receive periodic (daily/ weekly/ monthly) reports and get it scrutinized by the field supervisors and save the records. These records are important, along with the measuring book, for the acknowledgement of work.
