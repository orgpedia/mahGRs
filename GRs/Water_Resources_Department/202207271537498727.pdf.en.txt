The Proposal:
The Mula Irrigation Project consists of two major canals, the Mula Right Bank Canal and the Mula Left Bank Canal. The original right bank canal is 52 km long and was completed in 1972-73. The projected water carrying capacity from the origin is 1650 cusecs. The water management of the entire benefit area of the Mula Dam project has been transferred to the Water Utilization Agency since 2006. All water use agencies are functional and water is being metered as per demand at government rates.
The construction of the canal has been completed for 50 years and the canal irrigates the area in all three seasons- kharif, rabi and summer. According to the field officials, the project was implemented on a large scale. Rahuri, G. Ahmednagar Mula Right Canal/ Pathardi Branch Canal S.A. No. 18/280 K. That's me. No. 18/580 K. Due to the overflowing of the canal, a large amount of water is wasted, resulting in an increase in the canal transportation cost, and the surrounding agriculture and orchards are damaged due to the flood.
