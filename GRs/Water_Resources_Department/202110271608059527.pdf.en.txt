The Department of Water Resources
Government Decision JVPR 2021/ PR No. 82/2021/ JV
Mantralaya, Mumbai- 400032
The date: 27. 10.2021
The Proposal:
In line with the Union Government's target of generating 175 GW of renewable energy from new and renewable energy sources by 2022, the Maharashtra State Power Department has launched a scheme under the" Non-Conventional Energy Generation Policy-2020." As per the decision taken by the Government on 31st December, 2020, a target has been set to generate total 25000 MW of non-conventional energy by 2025. Given the rapid capacity addition from non-conventional energy sources such as solar and wind, and the discrepancies in the generation of power from these projects, considering the grid balance of the country instead of the state, UDANCHAN hydroelectric projects will be useful in the future, and if the non-conventional energy projects such as solar and wind are integrated with UDANCHAN hydroelectric projects, UDANCHAN scheme can be a useful option for grid balance.
Government policy. As per the Privatization Policy dated 15th September, 2005, the 25th May, 2005.
Small hydroelectricity up to capacity is being developed. But there is no government policy to develop hydroelectric projects of the Udanchana type under the privatization policy. The Ghatghar Udhanchan Hydroelectric Project of 250 MW capacity with Government investment through Water Resources Department has been successfully commissioned in the year 2008 and the Department has a total installed capacity of 7655 MW. Road map of 12 hydroelectric projects of W.P. capacity is ready. However, the huge requirement of funds for these ambitious schemes has to be met by the government considering the existing liabilities of the state. Therefore, the development of the Udanchana scheme through the Central Government authorized authorities/ private investors in the state through the department can be the most joint option.
In this regard, the Department has received proposals from various Central Government approved undertakings/ joint ventures for the UDANCHAN Hydro Electric Projects which are in the road map of Government of Maharashtra as well as from private investors for approval of UDANCHAN/ Integrated UDANCHAN Hydro Electric Projects.
The government policy on developing the Udanchana hydroelectric project under privatisation is not in place at present. Accordingly, after studying the policies and guidelines issued from time to time by the Union Ministry of Power (MoP), Central Electricity Authority (CEA), Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) as well as the state's Department of Industry, Energy and Labor, the government was considering the formation of a study committee with members such as experts and analysts in the field to determine the government's policy on the development of the Udanchana hydroelectric project under privatization in the state.
