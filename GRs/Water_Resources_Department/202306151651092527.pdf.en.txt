Introduction: The Sheel Minor Irrigation Project was constructed in 1996 on the local Sheel canal near Sheel village in Ratnagiri. The total length of the dam is 373 metres, the height 33.31 metres and the width 4.50 metres. The construction of the sewerage system has been done in the Ogi method on the left side of the scheme.
The total length of the tunnel is 93 metres. That's so much. The upper and lower sides of the wall are made of stone. The energy expenditure structure (EDA) has been built on the underside of the waste.
The hill on the left side of the dam should be removed 70 m to prevent the dam from being threatened by erosion during the rainy season and entering the Sandwa Access Channel and Tail Channel. And in the tail section 107m, the protective wall was built according to the GravyLoft concept. During the monsoon season of 2010, a large amount of land from the upper hill area on the 70 m long retaining wall on the left and 107 m long retaining wall on the lower side of the drain collapsed, putting additional pressure on both the retaining walls.

Govt. Decision No.: PARAMPRA-2022/ (P.S. 124/2022)/ SINVYA (Works) Sandwa had developed cracks at some places on the approach road. Similarly, the 107m. 50 meters from the wall. The wall collapsed and the rest of the wall was buried under the landslide. Since then, the retaining walls have seen an increase every year after the 2011 monsoon season. During the heavy rainfall in the monsoon season 2019 on 5/8/2019, a large portion of the hill above the retaining wall was washed away by landslide and 70 m of the upper side was washed away due to erosion of the upper and lower side of the drain. The protective wall of the length is completely collapsed into the interior of the sewer. As a result, large quantities of mud, sand and stones have accumulated on the road.
As a result, a large amount of mountain soil is being deposited in the drainage basin along with the flow of water from the tail path of the sewer. As a result, the width of the water flow in the Puch canal has been reduced and it is likely that the water flowing through the sewer will be diverted to the non-overflow section in the future. The repair of the wall is also mentioned in the annual dam status report of the Dam Safety Organization.
Against this backdrop, the plan. A proposal to give administrative approval to the reconstruction of the party wall and guard wall on the lower and upper side of the Ratnagiri sandwiches under special amendment was under consideration of the government. The government has taken the following decisions:
