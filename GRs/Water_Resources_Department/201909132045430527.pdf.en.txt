Project Bagh is an inter-state joint venture between the states of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh to construct the Sirpur Storage Dam, Pujaritola Unnayi Weir and Kalisarar Dam on the Bagh River in Salekasa Taluka of Gondia district in the Wainganga sub-basin of the Godavari basin. The construction of the Bagh project was completed in 1970 and the total live storage capacity of the dam is 229.35 Dalghami. As per the inter-state agreement, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh share water 3:1. The left canal is 60 km and the right canal is 65 km. I.
Length (29 km in Maharashtra and 36 km in Tamil Nadu) A major canal has been dug in Madhya Pradesh (Madhya Pradesh), through which a total area of 35718 hectares in 165 villages of Saleksa, Amgaon and Gondia taluks has been created. Irrigation through canal was started from the year 1970 itself. The total length of the main canal, branch canal, distributary, minor and sub-tract canal of the Bagh project is 450 km and there are 2866 small and big structures on it. The soil work in the main canal and distribution system has been disrupted to a great extent due to regular heavy rains in the project area. Also, the increased grass in the drainage area has reduced the carrying capacity of the canal. Most of the structures on the canal are 45 years old and have been damaged, some completely and some partially. A large amount of water is being wasted due to leakage from the damaged building. Due to the above reasons, the actual irrigation capacity is less than the built-up irrigation capacity due to the difficulty in supplying water to the tail-end areas of the canal. Accordingly, the canal distribution system has been restored as per the proposed cut.
