Reference:- 1) Department of Water Resources, Govt. Decision No.DRS-1079/ (2727)/ Reg. 08.07.1981.

The Proposal:
In the benefit areas of irrigation projects in the state, black and heavy lands do not have adequate drainage and due to excessive use of water in the fields, the underground water comes to the surface and such lands become wet and spoil. The soil becomes saline and degrades due to the accumulation of alkali layers in the upper layer of the soil and the introduction of underground alkali to the surface. Preventive measures to prevent formation of Kharaba area/ Saline zone e.g. ) Use, less use of chemical fertilizers, adherence to IQ limits, etc.
Such a saline and wet land needs improvement. Otherwise, they will become ineffective and production will be reduced.
The survey of saline/ saline lands in the benefit areas of large and medium projects of the Water Resources Department and the works of char schemes are carried out with government funds. However, under the relevant Government decision, it has been directed to conduct survey for the land in the benefit of private and cooperative lift irrigation schemes only from the Government fund.
Representations of various people's representatives, starred questions in the Legislative Council, (promises), half-hour discussions, etc. were raised to address this gap. In fact, the private and cooperative irrigation schemes are jointly set up and run by the farmers at their own cost. This will help in saving water and saving the government's expenditure.
The country's agricultural and rural economy has grown. Many schemes have been in operation for 30-40 years. The type of soil in the beneficiary areas of these schemes, lack of drainage, soil quality, etc. have led to increased soil salinity over time. The lands are lying unutilised as there is no fund from the government for their improvement.
