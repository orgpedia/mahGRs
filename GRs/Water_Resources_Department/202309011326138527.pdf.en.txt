The total length of the canal is 86 km and the project was completed in 1868 and first opened for irrigation in the Rabi season of 1868-69. The total irrigated area of the project is 13366 hectares.

As the protective wall on both sides of the place is proposed to be erected on the lower side, the direction of the regional officer was brought to fix the canal cut. Also, from 0/630 to 0/730 C.E. No. 0/900 to 1/050 Km Since the soil fill in the canal is collapsing on a large scale during the inspection path, the construction of a protective wall on the side of the inspection path at the place of the chain number to keep the canal cutoff in order, as well as the construction of a protective wall in the middle of the canal. Nos. 1/660 to 1/945 as well. No.
The field officers came to the conclusion that since the filling of the inspection line and the service line side is heavily eroded between 1/945 km and 2/100 km, the construction of the retaining wall and lining of the underpass should be done along the entire length of the bridge to ensure that the cutting remains intact.
