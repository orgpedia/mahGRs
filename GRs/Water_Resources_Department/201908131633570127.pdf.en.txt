GOVERNMENT DECISION, DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE, NO. GHABAN-2012/ P.S. 30/2012/ REGULATIONS, D. 20.02.2015.
The Proposal:
Finance Department No. As per the provisions of paragraph 10 of the Government Resolution No. 1, the administrative department is empowered to waive off the entire interest on the housing advance in the name of the government employee in the event of his death while in service.
Accordingly, proposals are submitted to the Government by the Regional Offices under the Water Resources Department for waiver of the balance amount of interest on house construction advance on the date of death of the deceased officer/ employee. It has been observed that the process of verifying the proposals received from the Regional Office, reporting the errors in the proposals to the Regional Office, sending repeated reminders in case of non-receipt of the error, issuing orders to forgive the interest amount by correcting the errors, is taking a lot of time. Accordingly, it was under the consideration of the government to determine the procedure for submitting proposals from the government level and to give instructions to the regional offices.
Circular:
Proposals received from the Regional Office must be complete to avoid delay in issuing orders for waiver of interest on housing advances. In order to avoid the delay in waiving off the entire interest/ balance interest on the house building advance,
Care should be taken to examine the facts in the return and submit a proposal for interest waiver to the government accordingly.
If the proposal is submitted to the government by the field offices without checking the matters in the return accompanying the circular, then action should be taken against the officers/ employees responsible for the delay in the matter and for dereliction of duty under the Prevention of Delay in Performing Government Duties Act, 2005.
It may be noted that it shall be the responsibility of the Head of Office/ Controlling Officer to examine and submit the complete proposal along with the items in the checklist as mentioned in paragraph 1 above in the prescribed manner within the prescribed time.
