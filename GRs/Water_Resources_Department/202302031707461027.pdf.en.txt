Introduction: The Anjana Palashi Medium Project has been completed in the year 1998 at a distance of 0.5 km on the Sillod-Kannada Road, west of Pishor village on the Anjana River. The project consists of two main canals, left and right, each 11 km long, and is envisaged to irrigate 2030 hectares. So the dead stock is 1.81 dlh. The length of the project is 208 m. That's so much.
The construction of the main canal, left and right and above distribution system of the Anjana Palashi project has taken 25 years and the structures are stone. The distribution system in the proposed SEZ will be from certain black soil (B. (C. Soil). Also, the distribution system and the construction on it near the slopes of the hill top are in a dilapidated condition in most places, water is seen gushing from the canal. As a result, the carrying capacity of the canals and distribution system has been reduced.
Therefore, the main canal and canal are being repaired.
Similarly, the total length of the earthen dam of the Anjana Palashi Medium Project is 0 to 1744 m and due to the formation of rain cut on the outer side of the dam slope, it is very necessary to pump mud there. Also, because of the small amount of leakage from the joint, joint repair is necessary. Against this backdrop, Anjana ran away. The proposal to give administrative approval to the budget of the main dam and canal works of the medium project of Kannada, G. Aurangabad under special amendment was under the consideration of the government. The government has taken the following decisions:
