The Proposal:
Gunjali village is located at a distance of 4.50 km from Neral Gaund on Pandharpur Chiplun state highway. It is 42 km from Karad. I'm in a remote area. Gunjali is situated on the right bank of the Koyna River. Due to the special nature of the river bank soil of the village, the regular discharge from the Koyna Dam also causes continuous erosion in a large length of the river bank. The Koyna dam, located near Haygaon village on the Koyna river, has a storage capacity of 105 TMC. In August 2011, 1,30,000 cusecs of water was released into the Koyna river. Therefore, the villagers along the river bank are saying that they have become landless due to the erosion of this large amount of land. The flood situation is caused by the rainfall in the upper free catchment area of Gunjali village and the water released from the Koyna dam. The main reason for this is the extensive damage to the soil.
Also, due to the steep slope of the river, the land on the right bank of the river is being eroded by the flood and the river bank near the village is becoming unstable. The demand for this work was made by the Gram Panchayat, Gunjali.
