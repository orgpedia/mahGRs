Policy For Renovation, Modernisation, Uprating and Life Extension (RMU&LE) of Hydroelectric Projects on Lease, Renovate, Operate and Transfer (LROT) Basis.
GOVERNMENT OF MAHARASHTRA
WATER RESOURCES DEPARTMENT
Government Resolution No. HEP2021/C.R.45/2021/HP
Mantralaya, Mumbai 400032
Date : 21.08.2024
1) Preamble:
Hydroelectric power generation has many well recognised advantages. It is environmentally
clean and renewable energy source with high degree of flexibility and reliability. In the
overall economic interests of the State and the Country, hydro potential has to be optimally
harnessed and operated efficiently by constant maintenance, renovation and modernisation.
Normally, the life of the civil structure, of the hydroelectric project is about 100 years but the
normative life of the hydro-mechanical and electro-mechanical equipment is 35 years. With
aging, the performance of the plant declines due to wear and tear of its various parts. Over a
period of time, maintenance becomes costly and difficult due to non-availability of spares. In
a fast-changing technological environment, control protection system comprising of electronic
components and operating software become obsolete in a period of 10 to 12 years. This leads
to frequent unplanned breakdowns and reduction in efficiency & reliability.
Renovation, Modernisation, Uprating & Life Extension (RMU&LE) of old hydro-electric
plants has been accorded high priority by the Government of India as it is considered as a
faster and cheaper option of capacity addition in comparison to installing new units, as critical
issues like land acquisition, forest clearance or R & R, geological surprises, new evacuation
arrangements are not involved. It improves the operational reliability and efficiency. It also
extends the plant life by 25 years. In implementation of RMU&LE program, risk of time
overrun is very limited. Thus, there exists encouraging environment for the PPP in
implementation of RMU&LE program of the hydropower projects.
2) Status of Hydroelectric Projects in the State:
In the state of Maharashtra, the hydroelectric projects have been constructed by the Water
Resources Department(WRD). After commissioning, these projects were handed over to then
Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) for operation and maintenance. Now, post
trifurcation of MSEB, these projects are being operated and maintained by the State owned,
Maharashtra State Power Generation Company Limited (MAHAGENCoO). Presently, 25
projects of total installed capacity of 2578.95 MW, which were constructed by WRD and now
owned by the Irrigation Development Corporations (IDCs) are being operated by
# Page 2
Government Resolution No.: HEP2021/C.R.45/2021/HP
MAHAGENCo. In addition to 25 hydroelectric projects that are presently operated by
MAHAGENCO, there exist 6 more projects of 9.575 MW capacity, which are constructed and
presently being operated by the WRD. The details of these projects are enclosed as
Annexures- I & II. Out of 25 hydro electric projects being operated by MAHAGENCOo, 10
projects of 622MW installed capacity as per Annexure-III have completed its normative
useful life and another 4 projects of 37 MW installed capacity as per Annexure-IV will follow
sult.
3) Relevant Legal Provisions:
a) Government of Maharashtra, through various enactments has constituted five Irrigation
Development Corporations (IDC) 1n the State viz.
e Maharashtra Krishna Valley Development Corporation; (MAHARASHTRA ACT NO.
XV of 1996).
e Vidarbha Irrigation Development Corporation; (MAHARASHTRA ACT NO. XXVI of 1997).
e Godavari Marathwada Irrigation Development Corporation; (MAHARASHTRA ACT NO. XXIII of 1998).
e Tapi Irrigation Development Corporation; (MAHARASHTRA ACT NO. IV of 1998).
Konkan Irrigation Development Corporation; (MAHARASHTRA ACT NO. III of 1998).
As per the provisions in Section 15 of the respective IDC Acts, all the projects and
assets including hydroelectric projects, situated in the area of jurisdiction of these IDCs,
earlier vested with the State Government have been transferred to the respective IDCs.
b) Section 18 of these IDC Acts empowers the respective IDC to plan, investigate, design,
construct and manage, promote and operate schemes for the generation of hydroelectric
projects. These IDCs are also empowered to invite bids/offers for the purpose of all the
activities of the corporations, promote participation of any person or body for designing
and management of hydroelectric projects.
c) Electricity Act (EA), 2003 has delicensed the generation of electricity. Section 7 of the
Act provides that any generating company may establish, operate and maintain a
generating station without obtaining a license under this Act, if it complies with the
technical standards relating to connectivity with the grid referred to in clause (b) of the
Section 73 of the Act.
Thus respective IDCs by virtue of statutory provisions, being the owner of the
hydroelectric projects in their jurisdiction have right of harnessing the natural resources at
these sites for generation of hydro-electricity and earn revenue from it. Also IDCs can carry
out RMU&LE works and operate these hydropower plants.

4) Past Action:
The petition was filed with the MERC for guidance regarding the transfer of Veer HEP back
to the Water Resources Department for RMU. The Commission has mentioned in its order
dated 14.12.2009 that the ownership of the said project belongs to Water Resources
Department, hence Water Resources Department (WRD) should take a decision in this regard.
5) Need for the Policy & way forward :
By undertaking timely RMU&LE works, the existing generating plants can continue to
operate for extended period of 25 years with improved reliability and availability. However in
absence of any policy guidelines, the RMU&LE works have not been streamlined in the State.
Therefore the Government of Maharashtra, Water Resources Department (GOMWRD)
realised the need for policy intervention.
GOMWRD, constituted the Committee of experts to formulate the comprehensive draft of the
policy document, for implementation of RMU&LE activities through Public Private
Partnership (PPP). The Committee, after extensive consultation with the stakeholders and the
experts in the field submitted a comprehensive draft policy document to the State
Government.
Independent Hydropower Projects (IPPs), in which water is utilised only for power generation
and the projects are useful for stability & management of the grid and therefore considering
the strategic importance of these projects, MAHAGENCo can carry out RMU&LE works of
these IPPs. Further, MAHAGENCo has communicated that RMU&LE works of IPPs will be
carried out by them. Accordingly MAHAGENCO will carry out RMU&LE works of 6 IPPs
of 561.50 MW as listed in Annexure- III under category- I
Considering the above-mentioned background, legislative intents of the various enactments
mentioned in clause 3 above and the Report of the Committee, Government of Maharashtra
Water Resources Department with concurrence of State Cabinet meeting dt. 30.07.2024 1s
pleased to declare this policy for Renovation, Modernisation, Uprating & Life Extension of
over lived hydroelectric projects on Lease, Renovate, Operate & Transfer (LROT) basis.
6) Objectives of the Policy:
The State Government intends to achieve following objectives through this Policy:
a) Life Extension (LE) of over lived hydroelectric power plants by about 25 years, beyond its normative life.

private sector participation.
h) Protection of overall interest of consumers by timely completion of the RMU&LE
works without cost over-run and minimum loss of generation.
i) Generation of reasonable revenue for IDCs for sustenance of the infrastructure created
for harnessing the natural resources.
c) To lay down the comprehensive framework for effective implementation of the policy.
7) Scope:
The provisions in this policy are applicable to all the hydroelectric projects in the State
developed by the WRD, IDCs, and by developer under privatisation policies of the State
including the projects handed over to MAHAGENCO for operation & maintenance.
PART- A: IMPLEMENTATION FRAMEWORK
8) Identification of Projects / Units Requiring RMU&LE:
RMU&LE program needs to be taken up timely to prevent further deterioration in
operation of generating units which may lead to their premature retiring. Identification of
plants requiring renovation and modernisation need to be done well in advance as there
are several essentialities to be fulfilled which may take considerable time before
commencement of the actual execution of works. The projects requiring RMU&LE will
be primarily identified not only on the basis of its operating hours but on the basis of its
performance record and parameters such as:
e Reduction in generation due to frequent breakdowns and reduction in efficiency;
Reduction in plant availability due to frequent unplanned breakdowns;
Temperature rise, vibrations etc.;
e Uneconomical operations due to increase in O & M Cost;

# Page 5
Government Resolution No.: HEP2021/C.R.45/2021/HP
e Obsolescence of equipment and non-availability of spares;
The performance of all the projects shall be critically reviewed initially after 10 & 20
years of operations and every 5 years after 20 years of operation. The performance data
shall be documented in the standard format prescribed in the "Guidelines for Renovation"
& Modernisation of Hydro Power Stations "issued by the CEA (hereinafter referred to as
"CEA R & M Guidelines"), as amended from time to time. The projects based on the past
performance data and the criteria listed above shall be considered for Residual Life
Assessment (RLA) study. The Chief Engineer (Electrical), Hydro Projects, Mumbai or
any other competent authority, as may be identified by the GOMWRD will be responsible
for identification of projects for RMU&LE and timely carrying out RLA study.
9) Residual Life Assessment (RLA) Study:
Systematic RLA study of the primarily identified projects shall be conducted as a
mandatory technical requirement to assess the health and residual life of every component
of the hydro generating unit and to firm up the scope of RMU&LE plan.
RLA study, in order to avoid conflict of interests shall be conducted through an
independent institute or competent consultant who will not be involved subsequently in
the execution of RMU&LE works, directly or indirectly. This specific provision shall be
made in the bid document.
RLA study and its report shall be on the basis of inspections, diagnostic tests and checks
specified in the CEA R & M Guidelines. RLA study shall identify and address the
problems due to generic defects, design deficiency if any, aging, obsolescence of
equipment/components, non-availability of spares, low efficiency of generating units and
safety requirements.
In RLA study, the hydrology shall be reviewed and the hydropower potential shall be
reaffirmed, taking due cognizance of any change in hydrology over a period. Any scope
for uprating based on the availability of additional water if any shall also be evaluated.
RLA study, in addition to electromechanical components, must also give due attention to
hydro mechanical and civil components. Erosion damages of civil works especially in the
intake structures water conductor system and tail race channels require special attention.
Water leakages from the gates and intake structure shall also be given due consideration.
RLA Report should specify the envisaged RMU&LE plan, considering the life extension
of 25 years and techno-economic feasibility of uprating. The possibility of converting
existing baseload station to peaking station may also be considered.

PART- C: GENERATION & SALE OF ENERGY
17) Generation:
As per the provisions in EA 2003, the Generating Company during the term of the lease
shall be entitled to operate and maintain the power plant without obtaining any licence
provided the technical standards related to connectivity with the grid referred to in sub-
Section (b) of Section 73, provisions in Section 10, other relevant provisions in the EA
2003 and prevalent regulations / orders of the Commission are followed.
18) Scheduling & Despatch Principles for Electricity:
As per the provisions in the Section 33 of the EA 2003, Generating Company shall
comply with the directions of the Maharashtra State Load Despatch Centre (MSLDC). As
per the prevailing regulations of the Commission, all RE projects are presently treated as
'Must Run 'projects and shall not be subject to the' Merit Order Despatch 'principle,
however provisions in the Regulations of the Commission, issued from time to time, shall
be applicable.
19) Grid Interconnection and Evacuation Arrangements:
Grid interconnection and evacuation arrangement shall be governed by the prevailing Grid
Code, Regulations and the Orders of the Commission and the relevant provisions in the
Energy Purchase Agreements to be signed by the Generating Company with the
distribution licensee / Purchaser.
20) Wheeling and Transmission:
Applicability of wheeling and transmission charges and losses shall be governed by the
prevailing Regulations and Orders of the Commission.
21) Banking:
Banking facility shall be regulated by the provisions in the prevailing Regulations / Orders of
the Commission.

Government Resolution No.: HEP2021/C.R.45/2021/HP
22) Sale of Power:
The sale of electricity shall also be guided by the provisions in the prevalent RE policy and
Energy policy of the state. The Government of Maharashtra, in its' Non-Conventional Energy
Generation Policy -2020, has set the target of 380 MW to be achieved through SHPs by 2025
and has assured that it will purchase power from SHPs directly, through Energy Purchase
Agreements, at the rate to be decided by the Commission to achieve this target.
Further, the hydro generating plants covered under this RMU&LE policy, may result in
comparatively lower tariff than that of new projects. Hence, it would not be prudent to allow
its benefits to any person other than MSEDCL considering the fact that during the earlier
period of such plants, MSEDCL has partially serviced its cost through lease charges. Hence,
the first right of refusal of energy generated from hydroelectric plants covered under this
policy shall vest with the MSEDCL, the State-owned distribution licensee. Provided further
that MSEDCL shall provide the refusal in 30 (thirty) days from the date of receipt of the
request beyond which it shall be treated as deemed refusal. The tariff for sale of power to
distribution licensee shall be determined by the Commission. The Generating Company,
therefore will be required to approach the Commission, for determination of the tariff with
necessary petition under section 62 of the EA, 2003 and tariff regulations notified by the
Commission.
PART- D: Mandatory Payments to IDC
23) In addition to the payment of the Threshold Premium and the Upfront Premium, the
Generating Company will have to make the following mandatory payments to the respective
IDC:
a) Lease Charges: The lease charges for the transferred asset of the hydroelectric project
shall be at the rate of Rs.4.5 Lakhs per annum per MW of the installed capacity of the
hydroelectric project. These annual charges are for FY 2022-23. In case the generating
company intends to develop co-located hydro-solar hybrid project, the necessary additional
land, if available will be provided to the generating company. Else the IDC may give the
permission to install floating PV solar panels at appropriate locations in the reservoir, if
feasible. In such cases, additional land lease charges as provided in clause 25 (g) shall be
applicable.
b) Intake Maintenance Charges: The Generating Company shall pay the intake
maintenance charges to the IDC. In case of Category-I projects, the applicable intake
maintenance charges shall be Rs. 0.50 per kWh. And for Category-II projects applicable
intake maintenance charges shall be Rs. 0.10 per kWh. These annual charges are for FY
Page 13 of 26
# Page 14
Government Resolution No.: HEP2021/C.R.45/2021/HP
2022-23. But, if the Generating Company maintains the intake structure at its own cost, in
such case they need not to pay any intake maintenance charges to IDC.
c) The above rates of lease charges and intake maintenance charges shall be increased in
every subsequent year by 5% compounding and applicable from the first year of
commercial generation.
d) The Generating Company shall pay charges to the IDC as per rate decided by MERC for
13% free power of net energy exported from the hydroelectric project to the grid as per
National Hydro Policy 2008.
e) GST or any other tax applicable under reverse charge mechanism for such payments shall
be borne by the Generating Company.
f) Intake maintenance charges shall be invoiced quarterly at the end of each quarter and
lease charges shall be invoiced at the beginning of every financial year. All these charges
will have to be settled within 30 days from the date of invoice, along with the applicable
taxes thereon. Thereafter the interest at prevailing Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending
Rate (MCLR) plus 2% (Two percent) per annum on delayed payment for delayed period
shall be made applicable.
PART- E: Co-Located Hydro-Solar Hybrid Projects
24) In case the Generating Company opt to develop co-located hydro-solar hybrid
project, along with the RMU&LE of the existing hydropower plant under this policy, it will
be permitted to tap the solar potential of the land and/or roof top of the project handed over to
it, following the provisions in clause 25 below.
The IDC may also provide any additional land required for solar component, if available, on
lease basis. IDC, after ascertaining technical feasibility on case-to-case basis, may also
permit the solar installation on downstream slope of the dam or on the submergence of the
dam for installation of floating solar panels, subject to all necessary statutory clearances.
25) In case the Generating Company opt to develop hydro-solar hybrid project, as per
the provisions in clause 24 above, following additional provisions shall also be applicable.
a) The Generating Company, to which hydroelectric project is allotted by bidding, after
site inspection may submit the Techno Economic Feasibility Report for the co-located
solar project to CE (Electrical), Hydro Pojects, Mumbai along with the additional land
requirement if any and the necessary processing fees. The processing fee shall be Rs. 1
Lac per MW or part thereof, of solar installation considering base year 2022-23 and
same shall increase in every subsequent year by 5% compounding.
