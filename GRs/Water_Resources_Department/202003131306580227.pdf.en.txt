Introduction: The Middle School Project. Savner is located on the Umri Nala near Umri village in Nagpur, on the Nagpur-Savner-Pandhurna National Highway, north of Umri village. The project site is located at Longitude 21 25 45 Latitude 78 47 40 on the map. The original administrative approval for the project was granted by Government Decision No. UMR/ 1064/69364-I (2). 18/01/1966 to Rs. 41.66 crore. The work of filling up of this project was completed in the year 1971-72 and the project was transferred to the irrigation system management in the year 1971-72. The length of the dam is 485 metres. The total storage capacity of the project is 5.776 Dalghami and the live storage capacity is 5.142 Dalghami. The project consists of 1 main canal of 8.2 km length and 4 minor canals with a total length of 8410m. Their discharge capacities are 1.06 g/ s to 0.07 g/ s respectively. The total mandate area of the project is 2469 hectares with cultivable area of 1902 hectares and irrigated area of 963 hectares with irrigation potential of 1185 hectares. According to the project report, irrigation was proposed to be done in Kharif and Rabi seasons. At present, an average of 885 hectares of area is being irrigated under this project. Khapa minor canal is a mountain pass and the canal is a contour canal. The work of the canal has not been done for the last 5-6 years due to lack of funds. The distribution system of the canal is soil (B.C.Soil) and in some areas the canal passes through the floodplain. As a result, the river continues to flow in the area. The construction of the canal distribution system has been delayed by 45 years.
As the canal is adjacent to the mountain, every year during the rainy season, water from the mountain enters the canal and silt accumulates and the canal bursts from the floodplain. For irrigation irrigation irrigation is done by doing some amount of dyeing. Due to this reason the discharge of the canal can be reduced and the water can reach the tail end.
