Government Circular No: Meeting 0119- (PR No. 139/2019) Mechanics,
Madam Cama Marg, Hutatma Rajguru Chowk,
Mantralaya, Mumbai- 400 032
Date- 16/12/2019.
Reference: 1. Chief Engineer (D.& P.) ) and Joint Secretary. Inspection visit to workshop at Dapodi, Pune on 16.11.2019.
The Proposal:
In the review meeting of the mechanical organization's roofing program and the work of the mechanical organization for the 2019-2020 season, it was discussed that the potential of the mechanical organization should be fully utilized. The Chief Engineer (Dy. And p. ) and Joint Secretary. During the inspection visit to the Mechanical Workshop at Dapodi, Pune on 16.11.2019, it was observed that some of the vents and other material/ component parts are ready in the workshop premises, however, there is no migration of work area. There was lack of coordination between the Architecture and Mechanical departments regarding the demand for construction of gates/ components by the Architecture department and the actual construction to be done by the Mechanical Association. It has also been observed that since the demand for construction of gates is not being registered by the Architecture Department in a planned manner, there is no work in the mechanical workshops in some periods, while in some periods the demand is more than the production capacity and therefore the construction has to be done by the mechanical department through external mechanisms.
In the above background, the government was considering issuing guidelines for the proper use of mechanical workshops by maintaining coordination between the architectural and mechanical departments, as well as the action to be taken for the quality of construction and construction of gates.
The government has issued guidelines for this.
Government circular:
(1) Henceforth, the production capacity of a factory should be determined by the capacity of the machinery employed, not by the available labour.
2) Some of the machinery in the mechanical workshop is outdated. Some types of machinery cannot be kept in operation for various reasons (such as environmental clearance, proximity to the city, etc.), after reviewing these machines, these machines should be demarcated and sold by auctioning them.
3) Maharashtra has a large number of dams with gates. A large number of works have been completed. The barrage also includes vertical lift gates. For the embankment of the Kolhapur method also there is the need to change the locks after some years. The water gates of all the above types of projects need to be replaced after a few years of expiry. Considering this, it is necessary to create a calendar for replacing the gate by listing all these projects.

Government Circular No: Meeting 0119- (PR No. 139/2019) Mechanics,
This program will ensure proper planning for construction and funding of the gate, prevent risks to the project due to gate failure, and prevent possible loss of finance and lives. The work of preparing the calendar for replacing the gate should be done by the Dam Safety Organization, Nashik.
4) Construction of gates as per the time-bound schedule fixed as above and to plan the time-bound schedule of construction of gates so that required skilled/ semi-skilled labour is available through external mechanisms.
5) The pumps, auxiliary components of the pump, the citation tube, the per flood system in the irrigation scheme completed/ ongoing and to be continued by the department need to be replaced after a certain period of time, for which a time-bound program needs to be prepared. Time bound programme for replacement of iron pipe in closed tube distribution system should be submitted and implemented.
6) The mechanical engineering department should carry out all kinds of gate construction, citation pipe, pump ancillary work, tube distribution system, tube tube work through external system only after the newly drawn gate construction capacity of the workshops of the mechanical department is fully utilized as per point number 1, otherwise the responsibility will be fixed on the concerned.
7) Care must be taken to ensure that the door formation in the workshop does not remain rusty. For this, the Superintending Engineer (Mechanical) and the Superintending Engineer (Construction) have to work in coordination. In any case, the Superintending Engineer (Architecture) shall be responsible for ensuring that the gate and other materials are installed on the work site within six months.
Most of the mechanical workshops are located in big cities. Necessary Divisional Office/ Sub-Divisional Office of the Architecture Department should be made available as per requirement so that the land of the said workshop and colony is not encroached upon and its proper maintenance and repair is done.
