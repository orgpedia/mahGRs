Government Circular No: Land-2020/ (P.S. 207/2020)/ Sec. V. (Revenue)
Madam Cama Marg, Hutatma Rajguru Chowk,
Mantralaya, Mumbai 400 032,
Date: June 03, 2021
Reference:- Government Circular No. SRIKKEE- 2008/ (131/08)/ CV (Policy) D. 06/03/2009.
Preamble: As per the Government Circular in the above context, after reserving the project water for non-irrigated use in the State, Rs. The cost of restoration of irrigation up to Rs. 1.00 lakh is charged to the user of non-irrigated water.
It has come to the notice of the Government that the cost of restoration of irrigation is assessed on the basis of the circular referred to in the No Objection Certificate for conversion of land from agricultural use to non-agricultural use. There is no difference in the availability of water for irrigation due to the conversion of agricultural land into non-agricultural land. Therefore, the demand for the cost of irrigation restoration made in such a case is unjustified. A circular in this regard has been issued.
Government Circular: Irrigation restoration cost should not be charged on the basis of the circular referred to in the No Objection Certificate for conversion of land from agricultural use to non-agricultural use.
