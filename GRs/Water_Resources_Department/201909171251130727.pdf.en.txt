Madam Cama Marg, Hutatma Rajguru Chowk,
Mantralaya, Mumbai 400 032
Date of release: September 17, 2019
Reference: The meeting was chaired by the Chief Minister and State Water Resources Minister. Meeting held on 24/7/2019.
The Proposal:
The Marathwada region is a drought-prone and drought-prone region. Since the natural availability of water is low, the only option available is to divert the excess water from the Konkan to Marathwada. For this, after a detailed survey, the schemes that will be financially viable will be approved and their work will be started. The water can be diverted to the catchment areas of Pune, Gangapur, Waghad, Karanjawan, Bhandardara, Mula, Kadwa, Mukne, Bhawali etc. in the Godavari river basin in Marathwada adjoining the Nar-Par, Damanganga, Ulhas and Vaitarna basins in Konkan and further to the Jayakwadi dam in Marathwada.
2. d. In the Cabinet meeting held on 30.07.2019, a presentation was made by the Water Resources Department regarding the proposed river interlinking project to divert water from Paschim Vahini river basin to Marathwada in Godavari basin. In the presentation, a detailed discussion was held on the river linking project as well as the proposal put forward by the Water Resources Department. The Chief Minister has given in-principle approval to take further action in the following matters.
3. Inter-State Damanganga-Pinjal river linking projects and inter-State inter-State river linking projects at Nar-Par-Girna, Par-Godavari, Damanganga-Vaitarna-Godavari and Damanganga-Ekdare-Godavari should be taken up expeditiously with State funds, not as national projects. The project will provide 31.60 lh of water to Mumbai city, 25.60 lh of water to Marathwada region of Godavari basin and 10.76 lh of water to Tapi basin from Konkan.
A total of 360 million cubic feet of additional water is available in Ulhas, Vaitarna, Nar-Par and Damanganga basins of the Western Bahini river basin (Konkan). This excess water can be diverted to the Godavari basin.
For this, detailed survey and investigation of new river linking schemes should be undertaken immediately and detailed project reports of viable schemes should be prepared.
