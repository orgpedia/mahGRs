The Proposal: -
The Kal-Kumbhe project is under the control of the Chief Engineer, Water Resources Department, Konkan Region, Mumbai under the Konkan Irrigation Development Corporation and is located in the Savitri sub-basin of the Western Ghats. As per the original concept of Kal-Kumbhe Hydroelectric Projects, the Kal Hydroelectric Project was to be constructed at a cost of Rs. 9899.69 Lakhs and Kumbha Hydropower Project of Rs. The 9724.31 million was granted separate administrative approval in 1998.
As per the proposal, the Kumbhe Hydroelectric Project under the Kal-Kumbhe Hydroelectric Project is planned on Nirabai River, a tributary of Savitri River at Kumbhe in Mangaon Taluka of Raigad District and an earthen dam has been constructed under it on 10 May. A hydroelectric power station of Watt installed capacity was proposed. Also, the Kal Hydropower Project is planned on the Kal River, a tributary of the Savitri River at Warangi in Mahad taluka of Raigad district, under which an earthen dam was constructed and commissioned on 15 May. A hydroelectric power station of Watt installed capacity was proposed at Konjar.
Subsequently, in the year 2004, the project was awarded the first Suprama under the combined planning of Kal and Kumbhe Hydroelectric Project. Accordingly, the post-seed generation effluent under the Kumbhe Hydroelectric Project (2 X 10 MW) was to be released into the Kaal River instead of being released back into the Nirabai River.
Also, with the Kal Project coming into the open catchment area, these wells will store the hydroelectric project's water in the Kal Dam through the Kal Hydropower Project on 15 May. It was proposed to release the post-Watt power generation sewage into the Gandhari River. For this, it was proposed to use the water from the Kal Hydropower Project for the Gandhari Irrigation Project by constructing a dam across the Gandhari River. Therefore, it was decided to transfer 50% of the catchment area of the hydroelectric project to the Gandhari Irrigation Project and accordingly revise the administrative sanction for the Kal and Kumbhe Hydroelectric Project to a total cost of Rs. The 19487.12 million was first granted revised administrative approval in 2004.

Considering the increase in the project cost, in the year 2009, it was decided to invest Rs. The 37641.74 target price was revised to a higher level of administrative approval and in 2011, it was increased to Rs. The 74044.08 Attention Price was granted a third revised administrator approval.
The fourth Suprama report submitted to the government has excluded the Gandhari winding as the administrative approval of the winding has lapsed. For this reason, as well as the increase in the rating and other factors, the project is becoming impractical for a conventional hydroelectric project.
in the state. The Government Decision dated 20.12.2023 has issued a policy for the development of Udchan Hydropower Project (780) and associated Udchan Hydropower Project solar / other non-conventional hybrid projects through Public Private Partnership. The policy provides for the transfer of water on lease to a private developer for the development of a hydroelectric power plant at a cost of Rs. 1.33 lakh per millets / year / reservoir lease will be received by the Government as revenue. According to this provision, the remaining works of the dams of the Kal and Kumbha projects as well as the revenue from leasing of the proposed dams to complete the rehabilitation works pending since the Digha period, along with the revenue from other options, were under consideration for feasibility study.
Accordingly, a proposal was submitted for completion of both the dams and rehabilitation works of the Kal Kumbha project after examining it at the field level. Accordingly, the fourth revised administrative approval to the project was under consideration of the government.
