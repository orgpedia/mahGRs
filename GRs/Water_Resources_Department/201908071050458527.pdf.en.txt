12) It is a matter of serious concern that the Mechanics Association is not spending the funds demanded by the Mechanics Association on PROFORMA-I and the Government should take action in the prescribed manner as per Circular No. Sankhya 1014/ (No. 160/14)/ Mechanics dated 19.11.2014. After every quarter, the executive engineer (mechanical) should review the work on deposit basis and submit a report to the government through the superintending engineer (mechanical).
13) The final payment of the work should be submitted in the prescribed format to the funding authority as per the prevailing practice. Also, the certificate/ completion report of the construction officer should be obtained for the proper and well-maintained work.
