The total length of the distributaries is 12.70 km with a total benefit area of 2279 hectares. The carrying capacity of the distribution is 100 cusecs (2.83 cumecs). This distribution will cover the districts of Kedgaon, Khutbav, Galandwadi and Pargaon. The profit area of Daund village comes under Jalita. The work of this distributor is done during the British period in about 1879. Trees have been uprooted and the distribution network has been disrupted. The well has been partially damaged and the drain is overflowing. Due to the increase in the number of trees, it has become difficult for the canal service line and the inspection team to reach during the irrigation period. The construction work on the canal is also in progress. The delivery time is increasing. The water does not reach the tail-end areas of the canal and the distribution needs to be repaired, for which there is a demand from the local people's representatives and beneficiaries of the area. Regular maintenance and repair of the entire canal system is not possible with the available funds. At present, the Bhigwan branch canal. I 29 to 35 canal has been damaged due to the construction of culverts, embankments, village road bridges, australization, drainage, embankment etc. As a result, the flow of the canal is obstructed in every step and there is a huge leakage, as a result of which the rotation period is increased and water is being lost. Also, due to the fall in the current modernization, such types of canal ruptures are also occurring. Sadar
