The length of the Panjan left canal is 53.20 km with a projected carrying capacity of 7.093 FING (250 cusecs). The total irrigated area of Panjan Left Canal is 12141 hectares B. The irrigated area under extension is 2789 hectares and the total VST due to Left Canal is 14890. The area is under irrigation. The canal passes through Nashik, Dhule, Malegaon, Dhule, Bhadgaon and Jalgaon districts.
The taluks of Chalisgaon benefit.
Almost 50 years have passed since the construction of the Panjan Left Canal and due to the leakage from the B fill of the old lining of the Panjan Left Canal, the canal is not flowing with its projected carrying capacity of 250 cusecs (7.093 FAH) and at present the canal is only flowing at Yoo FRR. Similarly, the rotation period of the canal has also been doubled due to floods.
Instead of 4, 3 rotations are being given. Hence, irrigation to the farmers of Chalisgaon B Bhadgaon taluka.
Water is not available during the period and the income of the farmers decreases leading to depression among them.
The anger of the farmers has to be met with complaints. Hence, the farmers. MLA
The broken UCR lining on the Panjan left canal, as demanded by Chalisgaon, and
Renovation will help release the expected discharge from the canal and increase the carrying capacity of the canal to address the annual leakage of the canal during the rotation period without causing any loss to the farmers. Correcting the canal will reduce the rotation time, save water and provide increased rotation and help solve the drinking water problem of some villages.
