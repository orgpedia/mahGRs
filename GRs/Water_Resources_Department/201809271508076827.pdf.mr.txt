Preamble:
Government of India has launched National Water Mission (NWM) under National Action Plan for Climate Change. The main objective of the NWM is "Conservation of water, minimising wastage and ensuring its more equitable distribution both across and within State through integrated water resources development and management". Under the mission, every State and Union Territory is being supported to formulate a State Specific Action Plan for Water (SSAP-Water) for sustainable development and management of their water resources by linking with the respective State Action Plan for Climate Change and other sectoral plans. Since SSAP-Water is a collective exercise of numerous departments and agencies to be completed within specific time period, it is necessary to constitute two committees viz. State Level Steering Committee and State Level Monitoring Committee to review and monitor the progress of work.
Further, the first component of SSAP-Water viz State Water Budget for water security, safety and sustainability need to be duly approved by the State Steering Committee before submitting to the National Water Mission.
