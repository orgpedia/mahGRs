Government Decision No. CDA-2021/ S. No. 37/21/ Works (Part-II) The detailed budget of the underground chariot scheme has three main components of the construction of the underground chariot scheme, namely, Main Drain, Laterals and Deputy Collectors. However, the above administrative approval has been granted only to the provisions of Laterals and Collectors of the underground chariot scheme.
It has been observed that during the deluge from 21st to 23rd July, 2021, all natural drains, streams and streams are filled with silt and if the main drain is kept open, the underground grazing water will come back to the field. So, when the water from the porous laterals comes to the sub mains pipe, the water will be released into the river through the closed pipe of the main pipe, only then the water will drain and the water will leave the field. Therefore, it has been observed that when these components are separated from the technical point of view, the work of three main components of the underground mobile scheme, namely Field Laterals, Collectors and Main Drain (Main Drain), needs to be done in a combined manner.
Therefore, for the implementation of the proposed Sub Surface Drainage Scheme in 5 villages of Kavthe Piran, Oron Islampur, Ashta, Kasbe Digras and Borgaon in Sangli district, administrative approval is required to be provided with the matter of three main components- Field Laterals, Collectors and Main Drain (Main Drain).
Considering this, the Chief Engineer (JE), Water Resources Department, Pune, has given a detailed proposal regarding the administrative approval for the construction of the above-mentioned 5 villages of Sangli district in the Sub Surface Drainage Scheme with three main components- Field Laterals, Collectors and Main Drain. It has been submitted to the Government vide letter dated 16th July, 2021. The proposal was under the consideration of the government. A decision in this regard is being taken.
Government Decision: 1) Administrative approval has been given to the Sub Surface Drainage Scheme of 5 villages of Sangli district to improve the texture of alkaline lands and to eradicate Kharaba and alkaline areas. On June 23, 2021, the government passed a decision to construct a sub-surface drainage scheme consisting of three main components- Main Drain, Laterals and Sub Main Drain (Collectors). 93.76 crore (Rs. Administrative approval is being accorded to the pilot sub-surface drainage scheme for an amount of Rs.
(a) Decisions of the Department of Water Resources. 21/07/2020 b) Further, after completion of these works, the land will not be converted into non-agriculture (NA) after the reclamation of this saline land c) Micro irrigation (Drip/ Sprinkler) method will be adopted to cultivate this land
