Government Resolution No: Narrow- 2018/ (600/18)/ Lapa
Ministry, Mumbai- 400 032.
The date: November 13, 2019
Reference: State Cabinet Instructions dated 9-7-2019.
Introduction: Most of the rainwater that falls in the Konkan region of Maharashtra is drained into the sea by the western rivers in a short period of time. This source of fresh water is available only for a short period of time and even in this area where there is abundant water, there is water scarcity at the end of the year and during the summer.
As a result, people are facing lot of problems. Thus, it is possible to solve the problem of water scarcity in the region by better planning the water available during the rainy season or how? This needs to be studied. This can be achieved by constructing a series of dams across the rivers and tributaries of the Konkan, thereby raising the ground water level, or by constructing a dam. However, in the case of submarines, the work done in the past and the information available on it is very limited and detailed technical guidelines in this regard are absolutely required. It has become necessary to check the utility of submerged dams in order to solve the drinking water problems of the villages near the reservoir such as Koyna Hydroelectric Project, Bhandardara Project etc. Submersible dams or series of dams or balloon dams etc.
The government was contemplating to constitute a committee to prepare detailed guidelines in accordance with the geographical and hydrological conditions after conducting a detailed technical study of the options. A decision in this regard will be taken later.
GOVERNMENT DECISIONS: The following committees are being constituted to suggest alternatives for providing drinking water through submerged dams/ chain of dams, etc. and to constitute a committee for undertaking construction works.
1. Managing Director, Water Conservation Corporation, Aurangabad Chairman 2. Chief Engineer, Planning and Hydrology, Nashik Member 3. Regional Water Conservation Officer, Soil and Water Conservation Department, Thane Member 4. Superintending Engineer, Ratnagiri Irrigation Board, Kuarabau Ratnagiri Member 5. Superintending Engineer and Deputy Secretary (Minor Irrigation), Mantralaya, Mumbai Member 6. Superintending Engineer, Kukadi Irrigation Board, Pune Member 7. Superintending Engineer, Benefit Area Development Authority, Solapur Member 8. Superintending Engineer, Local Level, Pune Member Secretary

The Chairman of the Committee may appoint other members as may be required.
Functions of the Committee: 1. To lay down standards and make recommendations on water availability and water planning for construction of a series of submerged dams/ embankments.
2. To lay down criteria for water concept, control level, maximum storage of each type of dam in such a way that it does not affect the water use of the parent dam.
3. To study whether the embankment can be made of permanent cement type or balloon type according to new technology or using some other new technology.
4. To provide guidelines for hydrological and engineering conception of various components of dams and to determine the technical specifications to be used for their construction.
5. Recommending the criteria and economic criteria for site selection for construction.
6. To study the present status, actual use, problems caused by siltation, etc. of these earlier constructed dams and suggest measures for conception, construction and maintenance of these proposed dams.
(7) To appoint such sub-committee as may be required to be appointed in respect of technical and other standards of works in submerged embankments or in other cases.
Tenure: It will be mandatory to submit the final report on all the above issues to the government within 1 month.
