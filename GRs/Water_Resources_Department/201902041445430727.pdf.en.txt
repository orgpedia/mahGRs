However, since the land required for these schemes, the time taken to acquire them and the cost involved in rehabilitating the project victims is huge, the case requires funds to be made available from various Central Government schemes. As per the Central Water Commission's Guidelines for Submission, Appraisal and Acceptance of Irrigation and Multi-Purpose Projects 2017, the Central Water Commission (CWC) is required to examine the cost, benefit ratio, etc. of the scheme for final approval of the Advisory Committee of the Central Government and the State Government is required to obtain the consent of the State Finance Department for the final cost of the scheme. The projects which are approved by the competent authority (Expenditure Priority Committee/ MoA) under the above provisions. The State Finance Clearance of Finance Department was earlier being taken by the Department of Water Resources for availability of Central Financial Assistance/ Grants for projects which have received revised administrative approval. In this regard, in the meeting held with Secretary (Expenditure), Finance Department on 04/04/2018, the revised administrative approval proposal of the project in the Water Resources Department was approved by the Expenditure Priority Committee or MAA in consultation with the Planning and Finance Department. If the Cabinet approves, the approved cost of the project should not require separate approval for Investment Concurrence and State Finance Clearance.
The matter was under consideration of the government. Based on this, the following decisions are made.
Government's decision:
As per the above proposal, henceforth, the projects which have received administrative approval/ revised administrative approval with the concurrence of Finance and Planning Departments, will be referred to the Expenditure Priority Committee or MoEFCC in consultation with Planning and Finance Department.
