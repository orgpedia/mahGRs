The Proposal:
In the monsoon season of 2019, the Krishna Valley experienced unprecedented flooding due to excessive rainfall in the months of July and August. Kolhapur and Sangli districts are the worst affected. There was a huge loss of life and property. Opinions are divided on the causes of the flood. The situation was even worse in 2019.
The work of Almatti Dam in Karnataka has also been completed up to 519.60 m. Other water resources projects have also been completed in both the states. There are many technical issues. There has been a lot of progress in the remote sensing information system through satellites. It must also be used. To conduct a thorough technical investigation of all these aspects, to find out the causes of the flood situation, to find solutions to prevent such unfortunate incidents from recurring in the future, an expert study committee like (MRSAC), India Meteorological Department (IMD), Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority (MWRRA), Water Sector Analysts has been constituted. The committee was formed in accordance with the Government Decision No. 2. Also, reference No. The decision regarding the remuneration of the non-official members of the committee has been taken as per the Government Resolution No. 3. Reference No. A committee has been formed under Section 4.
The Committee has submitted the study report of Krishna Sub-Basin out of Bhima and Krishna basins to the Government on 27th May, 2020. Also, to study the Bhima Valley and submit a report, under reference No. 5 the decision of the Committee. The deadline has been extended to 30/06/2021. However, the catchment area of the Bhima basin is larger than that of the Krishna basin and hydrological and geological data is taking longer to obtain. Also, as the Flood Study Committee did not get sufficient time to complete the study of Bhima Valley due to the widespread infectious diseases and restrictions of COVID-19, the Committee was asked to study Bhima Valley as requested by the Chairman of the Committee and submit a report. The matter of extending the deadline till 31/03/2022 was under consideration of the government.
