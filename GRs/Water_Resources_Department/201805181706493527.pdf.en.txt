The Gosikhurd project was included in the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) in 2015-16 and the project is reviewed regularly at the level of Principal Secretary. Since 2015. The Gosikhurd project is also regularly reviewed in the War Room chaired by the Chief Minister and the State Level Sanctioning Committee chaired by the Chief Secretary. Therefore, the matter of scrapping the high-powered committee for the Gosikhurd project was under the consideration of the government as there was no need to review it again.
Government's decision:
In order to complete the Gosikhurd National Project in a time-bound manner within the stipulated time frame, the High Powered Committee constituted under the Government Decision dated 02/03/2010 to monitor the implementation of the project is hereby abolished.
