GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: PARIKH- 2022/ PR No. 349/22/ SINVYA (Works)
Mantralaya, Mumbai- 400 032
Date: 13/12/2022
Introduction: The water of the post-monsoon flow is being collected by the dams of the Kolhapur system completed in the state. The process of installation of needles/ barges is usually done in the month of September-October after the end of the rainy season and removal of the needles/ barges installed in the month of May-June before the start of the rainy season to save water in these dams.
However, there are many instances of water loss or non-recovery of water due to failure of installation and removal of needles/ barges or damage to the embankment of Kolhapur system due to non-extraction of needles/ barges.
It has been observed that in the last 1 to 2 years, the government has been receiving demands for conversion of these dams into barrages due to various reasons such as leakages from the old Kolhapur system of dams, due to the high volume of water, due to lack of water storage.
The government has approved the conversion of existing Kolhapur system dams into barrages under special amendment. However, in order to verify the need and utility of converting these embankments into barrages, as well as to determine the technical criteria for the same, it was necessary to form a committee in this regard.
Accordingly, the government has taken the following steps:
Government Decision: A Technical Committee has been constituted as follows to determine the comprehensive policy required to assess the need and utility of the existing Kolhapur system embankments completed in the State as per the regional conditions and to determine the technical criteria for the same.
