Introduction: Lendi Pradhan Project is a joint venture between the States of Maharashtra and Telangana, which was started in 1986. At present, 80% of the work has been completed. The work on the combined canal of this project is almost complete and the work on the remaining canal in the territory of Maharashtra is in progress. The dam work of the project has been stopped since 2011 due to non-fulfilment of rehabilitation demands of the project victims. The project covers 12 villages. Of these, 11 villages are being rehabilitated as land is available for rehabilitation. However, since the land for Mukramabad village was not available at one place, the issue of rehabilitation of the project victims through the option of voluntary resettlement was under the consideration of the government. Accordingly, the following decisions are being taken: Government Decision: As the Lendi project is an inter-state project, the Maharashtra Rehabilitation of Project Affected Persons Act is not applicable to it. Also, there is no provision for voluntary rehabilitation in the Maharashtra Project Affected Persons Rehabilitation Act, 1999. Since the project is an inter-state project, the project victims are required to be provided with payment facilities at least as per the Maharashtra Project Affected Persons Rehabilitation Act. Recently, the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 has been enacted in the State. A provision has been made for voluntary rehabilitation under Section 108.
