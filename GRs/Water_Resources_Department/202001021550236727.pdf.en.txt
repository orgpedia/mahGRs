Preamble: The Committee has observed that as per the recommendation No. 5.12 (4) of the 30th Public Accounts Committee Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India in its Appropriation Report for the year 2013-14, they have no control over the funds released by the Water Resources Department to the Corporation under them. Although the Water Resources Department and the corporations under it are audited by the Accountant General, only 10 per cent of the accounts are audited on a selective basis. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct regular annual audits. For this, the committee has recommended that a separate audit procedure should be introduced for the corporation under the department and the action taken in this regard should be reported to the committee within three months.
Also, Ma. Accountant General, Mumbai. The Audit of Water Resources Department (itself) for the period 01.07.2016 to 31.03.2017 was conducted from 15.04.2017 to 04.05.2017. During this period, the audit team has brought out a paragraph on creating a system of internal audit at the department level. Therefore, the matter of forming an audit team under the department was under the consideration of the government.
