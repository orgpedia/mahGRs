Government Circular No. 1120/ PR No. 363/20/ MP 1
Hutatma Rajguru Chowk, Madam Cama Marg,
Ministry, Mumbai- 400 032.
Date: January 13, 2021.
Background: In order to expedite the execution of irrigation projects, 5 Irrigation Development Corporations have been set up under Water Resources Department during April 1996 to August 1998.
As per the Corporation Act, the corporation has been empowered to take appropriate decision regarding the proposal of the projects. Also, various powers have been delegated to the field functionaries through various Government Decisions/ Circulars/ Codes. In this regard, it has been observed that proposals are submitted to the government for approval/ feedback without proper use of the powers provided at the field level. This is wasting the government's time. It has also been observed that the proposals submitted by the Corporation are submitted to the Government as per the prevailing procedure by the concerned Executive Directors without recording their self-explanatory opinion, as agreed by their subordinate office. Accordingly, the government was contemplating to issue directions to strictly use the powers given at the regional level.
Government Circular: In view of the above, this circular directs the following: 1) Proposals in the clear jurisdiction of the field officers provided to the field officers through various government decisions/ circulars/ codes should not be submitted to the government for feedback/ information.
Proposals at various levels of jurisdiction provided as per the Maharashtra Public Works Manual should not be submitted to the government for feedback/ information/ approval. The rules and government instructions in the Maharashtra Public Works Code regarding the measurement of work and payment/ settlement of dues are clear. Therefore, it should not be brought to the notice of the government.
(3) Proposals at various levels of jurisdiction, provided in accordance with the terms and conditions of the tender, should not be submitted to the Government for feedback/ information/ approval. The Regional Officer shall exercise the powers conferred by the terms and conditions of the tender.
4) The reasons for the proposals to be submitted to the Government should be clearly stated along with the context of various Government decisions/ circulars/ codes and the exact Government directives under which the proposals are being submitted.

5) Why is a special case a special case? What government guidelines should be followed? The reason for this should be clear. If there is a special case, it will require a clear recommendation/ approval of the regulatory body of the corporation.
The Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority, the State Technical Advisory Committee, the Government or other accrediting offices often approve/ agree to certain terms and conditions. Final approval, for example. These conditions must be fulfilled before granting administrative approval/ revised administrative approval etc. However, without fulfilling these conditions or conditions, the proposal has been sent/ the proceedings are in progress, the compliance is submitted in such a manner. As a result, these terms and conditions are not strictly enforced. Proposals should be submitted to the government only after fulfilling the conditions.
Be sure to follow the instructions above.
