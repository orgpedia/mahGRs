Introduction: The risk of damage to the canal distribution system may be less as compared to dams. However, the safety of the canal distribution system is of utmost importance for uninterrupted water supply for irrigation as well as domestic and industrial use.
(a) Periodic and regular inspection of the canal distribution system in accordance with its safety shall identify the faults in the structure of the canal distribution system and the damage caused by the construction or filling of the canal system so as to avert emergency situations, avoid costly rehabilitation works and also prevent loss of water, crops and property due to the damaged canal system.
(b) The publication of the Annual Health Status Report in the month of April every year will be an important tool for determining the priorities of canal maintenance and repair works.
In view of this, annual maintenance and repair planning will be done on top priority by the Executive Directors of all the Irrigation Development Corporations.

Detailed guidelines in the form of detailed questionnaire and prescribed form were available long back. However, there was no" prescribed form" available for inspection of the canal system. Uniform and standardized procedures, guidelines and prescribed forms for inspection of the canal
