Introduction: The Dudhganga Project is an inter-state project between the two states of Maharashtra and Karnataka.
Under this project, the Dudhganga river will be constructed. A combined dam of total length 1280 m has been constructed at Radhanagari, District Kolhapur with stone dam (length 490 m) in the middle and earthen dam (length 790 m) on both banks. The project is being implemented by the Maharashtra Krishna Valley Development Corporation (MSKDC). The project will irrigate a total area of 59,933 hectares (46,948 hectares) in Maharashtra and 12,985 hectares in Karnataka.
The project started in 1977. The construction of the dam was started in 1985. The construction of the dam was completed in 1999 with the construction of a sluice gate. (25.40 A.H.F.) such a project water storage was created. (23.98 A.H.) is such a living water body. The Dudhganga Project has received 3rd Revised Administrative Sanction in July 2011 at a cost of Rs. 1712.80 crore and the total cost of the projects as on 3/2022 is Rs. 1228.72 crore.
The dam is being filled to its full capacity since 2006. In 2007, the dam was found to be leaking at 360.50 Litre/ sec. As the leakage rate in the dam was found to be high, leak prevention works were taken up. The project was proposed by Central Concepts Association, Nashik and Chief Engineer, Water Resources Department, Pune.

Go to their letter No. Mu/ Q.A.3/ Q. 4/7577 D. As per the Grouting Pattern approved vide letter dated 21/12/2010, Cement Grouting work has been done in a total of 9 Monoliths of the stone dam during the period from 2010 to 2014. The spill containment measures have resulted in reduction in the level of water storage in the dam which was 166.66 Litre/ sec in 2016. This has increased in the current season. As on 30/9/2021, a leakage of 211.10 Litre/ sec has been detected at full storage level.
Since the permissible leakage from the stone dam is much larger than the permissible leakage, it has been stated in the annual pre-monsoon and post-monsoon reports as well as in the periodic visits and observations of the Chief Engineer (JE) Pune that it is imperative to bring down the permissible (70.43 Litre/ sec) leakage from the dam depending on the urgency of the leakage prevention plan.
Superintending Engineer, Dam Safety Organisation, Nashik. Pre-monsoon inspection of the dam was carried out on 19/4/2021 and 9/11/2021. Report on it. 3/2/2022 and 15/6/2022 respectively. According to the report, the water level of the dam was 631 metres and 644.41 metres on the day, while the rate of leakage from the stone dam was 73.68 liters per second and 264 liters per second, respectively.
A study has been conducted by CW& PRS, Pune to take leakage prevention measures to bring down the leakage of Dudhganga stone dam to permissible levels. Scientists from CW& PRS, Pune. Tracer Study for the dam was conducted from 22/10/2021 to 29/10/2021. And report on it. Submitted vide letter dated 29/11/2021. A field study on Nuclear Density Logging has been completed by CW& PRS Pune at a total of 8 holes in various monoliths in Dagdi Dam and a preliminary report has been submitted. Submitted as of 3/11/2022.
Under Dam Leak Prevention Measures from Dudhganga Rock Dam as suggested by CW& PRS Pune, 10 cm thickness of Shotcrete to be applied to the Coursed Rubble Septum at U/ s of the Dam. Fill the holes in the bottom of the dam. Grouting work from the top of the dam wall, from the observation gallery to the foundation gallery, cleaning the Vertical Porous Drain (VPD) pipe and drain hole in the dam, etc. have been included in the budget.
