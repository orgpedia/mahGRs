Introduction: The Kharbhoomi scheme of Panederi, Taluka Mandangad, District Ratnagiri is included in the broad scheme. The Union Forest Ministry has exempted the scheme under the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Act 1991. The original work of this scheme was completed by Kharland Board in 1993 and till date this scheme has not been renewed. A total area of 63.67 hectares has been protected under the scheme. The length of the embankment of the project is 2375 meters. It is 2285 m. Above is a canopy. The main building is 720 m high. to 285 m. It's gutted.
There's an opening on it. The work has been done with the cooperation of the people. At present, the level of the dam is 0.5 m. It is 1.00 m. It has decreased from 330 C.E. to 2285. Also, there is a fence on the side of the farm. and 1410 m. It is 1460 m. A large amount of saline water is being released into the river, which is causing damage to the protected areas. Also at 2285 m. At that time, the rock was completely eroded. This is causing damage to the protected areas. The slope of the embankment is mostly good and the slope of the embankment along the embankment is also good. Most of the project areas have been affected as the embankment of the scheme has become very weak and the embankment has become weak and the embankment has developed large cracks.
This inflicted heavy loss on the farmers. This plan needs to be revised.
The dam and embankment of the scheme are not in accordance with the new technical standards of the government. Therefore, it is necessary to update the program according to new technical standards. The village panchayat has demanded immediate repair of the road. The proposal to give administrative approval to the renovation work of Perdere Kharbhoomi scheme, which was received through a reference letter from the Chief Engineer, Water Resources Department, Konkan Region, Mumbai, was under consideration of the government. Accordingly, the government has taken the following steps:
