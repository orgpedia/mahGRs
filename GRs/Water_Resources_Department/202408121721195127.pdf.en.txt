Preamble: - The work of Kulthe Minor Lake at Kulte T.G. Dhule was completed in 1971 and the project is constructed near Kulte village on the Nandal Nallah. The project is a mud dam with a length of 640 m. The maximum height is 13.00 m. The catchment area of the project is 36.29 km2. The project's area of benefit is 1157.79. The irrigated area is 425.00.
Kulathe Minor Irrigation Lake T.G. Dhule project has been completed in the year 1971. It has been 52 years since the construction was completed. The project has a main canal and the length of the canal is 8. 00 km. In the past few years, heavy rains have caused some construction collapses on the canal. As a result, a large amount of water has been lost, reducing the area under irrigation. The canal embankment, the embankment, the water bridge, and some other constructions have been destroyed near Jabal. This has made it very difficult to manage irrigation.
The project is planned to transfer the canal to the Farmers' Water Use Agency for water distribution, canal distribution, farm maintenance repair, irrigation management, and irrigation recovery. For this purpose, the beneficiary farmers have demanded the repair of the project. Renovation of some other constructions like Redeemer, Redeemer Water Bridge, Vinipat etc. on the canal of Kulathe Minor Project has been proposed. Approximately 375 hectares of irrigated area is to be restored after the completion of this repair work.
Against this backdrop, a proposal was under the consideration of the government to grant administrative approval under a special amendment to the budget for repair works of various constructions on the G canal under Kulathe Minor Project Ta Dhule. Accordingly, the government is taking the following decisions.
The Government's Decisions:
Irrigation Sub-Division No. 2 Repair works along the Kulathe minor canal under Dhule will be subject to special revision in the budget. 1,36,91, 230 (One crore thirty six lakhs ninety one thousand two hundred and thirty only)
