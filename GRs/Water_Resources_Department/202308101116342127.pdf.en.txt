Introduction: The Arunavati Project is a major irrigation project in Digras Taluka of Yavatmal district. It is built on the river Arunavati. Work on the project began in May 1980 and was completed in June 1994. Since 1995, irrigation has been going on in the areas where the distribution system has been completed. The construction of the irrigation capacity of the project has been completed by the end of June 2008. The installed capacity of the project is 24003. The total water storage available is 169.69 LH.
The left main canal of Arunavati Project is devoid of lining and the canal has a large number of trees and bushes, silt has accumulated and the fill of the canal is buried. Also, a large amount of water is being lost from the pipe hole and the aqueduct, as a result of which the irrigation in the last part of the canal is decreasing and the beneficiaries are facing the wrath of not getting water from the planned discharge to the last end. The water is leaking due to the overflowing of the canal at various places, which has caused a threat to the adjacent agricultural land, and the agricultural land is being damaged due to the leakage/ leakage from the canal's fill and various constructions.
Accordingly, the proposal to give administrative approval to the repair work of the left canal in the 28-55 km of Arunavati project under special repair was under consideration of the government. The government has taken the following decisions:
