Introduction: The Terna Medium Project, Osmanabad is built on the Terna River in 1964. The project consists of a right canal and a left canal, the length of the right canal is 16 km and the irrigation potential is 902 hectares. The length of the left canal is 15 km and the irrigation potential is 750 hectares. The total area of the project is 1652 hectares. The length of the earth dam is 2437 m. The maximum height is 15.23 m. The project has been finally irrigated through a canal in 2011. Subsequently, Terna Medium Project was taken up in 2012 as a pilot project for providing irrigation through closed pipelines. However, the closed pipeline distribution system is currently closed due to some technical problems and irrigation through the right and left canal has been stopped. Due to delay in irrigation through closed pipeline distribution system and the dam being full to its full capacity, it is not possible to supply water through canal or closed pipeline distribution system, there is a frequent demand from the beneficiaries to repair the canal. On completion of the above works, 1652 hectares will be irrigated with the available water resources.
In this background, the government was considering a proposal to give administrative approval to the budget of the right and left canal repair works of the Terna Medium Project T.G. Osmanabad Project under a special amendment. The government has taken the following decisions:
