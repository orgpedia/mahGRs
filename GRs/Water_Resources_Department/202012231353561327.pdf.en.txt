Government Resolution No.: CDA 2020/ (Q. No. 72/20)/ Grants (Works)
Madam Cama Marg, Hutatma Rajguru Chowk,
Mantralaya, Mumbai- 400032
Date is December 23, 2020.
GOVERNMENT DECISION NO. VISU-2015/ PR No. 218/ Building-II, dated 16th December, 2015.
The Proposal:
The Superintending Engineer and Director, Directorate of Irrigation Research and Development, Pune are not under the control of any Chief Engineer but directly under the control of the Government. Therefore, there are difficulties in proceeding with the work of the Directorate in which the approval of the Chief Engineer is required as per the provisions of the Maharashtra Public Works Manual (as amended by the decision in question) or in matters which do not fall within the competence of the Superintending Engineer but fall within the competence of the Chief Engineer. In order to remove the above difficulties, the matter of authorizing the area-wise Chief Engineer as the competent Chief Engineer for the work of the Directorate was under the consideration of the Government.
Government's decision:
In cases where the approval of the Chief Engineer is required as per the provisions of the Maharashtra Public Works Rules or the Standing Orders of the Government, the Chief Engineer in whose jurisdiction the work is to be carried out, is being authorized to give the said approval. The Chief Engineer (Water Resources), Water Resources Department, Pune is being authorized to grant approval in cases where the work in the Directorate is not strictly under the purview of any Chief Engineer.
