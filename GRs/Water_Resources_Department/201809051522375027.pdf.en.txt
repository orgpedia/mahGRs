It will have a capacity to store 1,138 litres of water. Seven projects are in the process of approval. Proposal for approval of these 7 projects is under consideration subject to revised administrative approval of expenditure (including past balance) as per the approved budgetary provision for the financial year 2018-19.
Hon'ble Governor has given instructions from time to time to complete the pending projects of the state on first priority considering the remaining cost of the projects under construction and the available funds, to complete the essential component works of the projects immediately to take advantage of irrigation in the limited funds available immediately. Funds are allocated according to priority. However, there are restrictions on expenditure beyond administrative sanction/ revised administrative sanction as per Para 134 of the Public Works Rules. As a result, a large amount of funds allocated as per priority are lying unutilised and the projects are getting delayed. This is causing difficulties in meeting the objectives agreed in the MoU with the Central Government. At present, the proposals of 6 irrigation projects under construction have been submitted to the government committee. A proposal is in the final stages of approval before the state-level technical review committee. However, considering the scope and number of cases, the entire process of approval of these Supramas will take some time. Expenditure beyond the sanctioned amount/ supra amount for land acquisition and rehabilitation works required for projects not having change in the original amount/ supra amount and scope for completion of irrigation projects in the interim period. As per the Government letter dated 09/12/2013. Due to this, even if the land is acquired at the cost of land acquisition/ rehabilitation, the target of completing the priority irrigation project cannot be achieved as it cannot be spent on construction in the absence of Suprama. As a result, farmers are losing irrigation facilities.
Further, as per Section 134 of the Maharashtra Public Works Rules, if the amount of cost or potential cost of the project is more than 10% or Rs. If the amount is less than Rs 1 crore, then the revised administrative approval is required. In this provision of the Public Works Rules, price rise and price rise have been considered together.
Aging is a natural process. The authorities have no control over it. Also, the price of land has gone up in the recent past. The cost of land acquisition and rehabilitation component is incurred in the initial phase of the project. Approved on the components of land acquisition and rehabilitation. After the expenditure exceeds the provision for that component in the project, the total cost reaches the approved administrative cost before the administrative sanction provision for construction is fully utilized. As a result, the construction cost cannot be exceeded.
Considering the time taken for grant of revised administrative approval to irrigation projects and the number of projects and the possibility of increase in the project cost in case of closure of the project due to restrictions on the availability of funds, the project-wise provision limit for 2018-19 under the revised administrative approval may be increased with certain conditions (including the previous balance).
