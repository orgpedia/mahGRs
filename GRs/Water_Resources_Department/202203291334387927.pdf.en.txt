The Proposal:
The decision was taken by the Finance Ministry. Creation of new posts and filling up of vacant posts as per Government Order dated 28.5.1986 and creation of posts in day-to-day/ casual establishment as per Government Order dated 6.12.1989 were prohibited. The work of equivalent or higher rank was done by the employees appointed as labourers or similar posts as per the requirement.
However, while performing such tasks, they were paid the same salary as the lower rank assigned to the original assignment, rather than the salary of the senior rank. This situation had led to the problem of giving salary according to the work and according to the work.
