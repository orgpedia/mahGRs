The Proposal:
It has been decided to transfer the amount received as loan from NABARD and Central Assistance under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana and Baliraja Jal Sanjeevi Yojana to the bank accounts of Irrigation Development Corporation of the State directly under the decision of the Government of Reference No. 1.
Considering the difficulties in implementing the decision and creating a system in accordance with the procedures prescribed in connection with the implementation of this decision, the government was considering extending the time for implementing this decision.
Government's decision:
Since the decision was taken in December, 2018 for the financial year 2018-19, it was not implemented in 2018-19 to avoid duplication as the funds are to be provided to the Corporations in this financial year within the limits of the budgetary provision and the Corporations were provided funds from the budgetary fund before this decision. As a result, the central assistance received under the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayan Yojana and Baliraja Jal Sanjeevi Yojana and the loan received from NABARD on the account of the State Government were deposited in the Consolidated Fund of the State.
Central Government approval for borrowing for projects under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) and Baliraja Jal Sanjeevi Yojana (BJY) for the financial year 2019-2020. Governing Council of NABARD for sanctioning of loans under RIDF under Baliraja Jal Sanjeevi Yojana

It will take a long time for the projects to be funded after getting the approval of the Board and then submitting the proposal to NABARD/ Central Government and their approval. Therefore, as the funds are required to be provided as per the requirement of the projects for completion of the projects within the stipulated time frame, the decision taken under Reference No. 1 to provide funds to these projects from the budgetary allocation made in 2019-20 is being extended.
Therefore, for the year 2019-20, the amount received as loan from NABARD for the projects under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana and Baliraja Jal Sanjeevi Yojana on the account of the State Government and the amount received as central assistance under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana should be deposited in the Consolidated Fund of the State Government. The decision taken under Reference No. 1 is being approved for implementation from the financial year 2020-21.
