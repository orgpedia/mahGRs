Introduction: The lake. It is built 3 km downstream of the drain at Yeldarwadi near Mauje Andhori in Ahmedpur taluka. The total catchment area of the reservoir is 5.49 sq. That's me. The construction of this lake was completed in June 2006.
The project has a project storage capacity of 1.219 LHM and the upstream irrigation of the lake irrigates an area of 368 hectares on the upper and side slopes. The length of the tail channel of Andhori Storage Lake is 240 meters. Its width is 30 meters. And the river has a steep slope. Because of the steep slope opposite to the tail canal the discharge of the flood from the left side of the tail canal has eroded the layers near the guide wall and the rocks have fallen parallel to the guide wall.
The base of the guide wall is open throughout. This poses a threat to the guide wall. It has also been observed that the entire foundation of the guide wall and toe wall has been exposed, posing a threat to the dam. Accordingly, in order to correct the errors in the annual dam status report of Dam Safety Organization, Nashik and the inspection note issued in connection with their physical visit, the Andhori Storage Pond Trust has been formed.
