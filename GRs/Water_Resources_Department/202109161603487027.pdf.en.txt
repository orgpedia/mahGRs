2) At least 20 to 100 meters if there is soil work and excavation. Measurements should be calculated accordingly by taking the actual cutoff at a distance and showing the existing cutoff at the proposed cutoff.
3) Lining:- At least 20 to 100 meters for canal lining work.
The measurements should be calculated accordingly by taking the actual cutting at a distance and showing the proposed works at the existing cutting.
4) CNS lining should be proposed where and at the same height as the black soil strata classification.
5) The soil work of dams and canals should be proposed by the mechanical department on priority. Soil work should be proposed through tender only if it is not possible to provide machinery from the mechanical department. The Superintending Engineer/ Chief Engineer should take this decision.
6) Care should be taken to ensure that the volume of casing from the borrowing area in the soil work is minimum and the use from the available should be maximum.
If you want to increase the height of the dam, check the depth of the dam.
7) Specific chain number should be mentioned if pitching work is to be done in exceptional circumstances.
8) Toe drain pitching should not be done as much as possible.
