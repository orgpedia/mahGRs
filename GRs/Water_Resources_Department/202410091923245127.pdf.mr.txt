Establishment of State Water Informatics Centre (SWIC) in the State of Maharashtra
Government of Maharashtra
Water Resources Department
Government Resolution No. MISC-2019/157/C.R.53/2019 Madam Cama Road, Mantralaya, Mumbai
Date: 09/10/2024
Preamble:
Water is one of the precious resource and increasingly under pressure due to factors like population growth, economic development, urbanization and
climate change etc. Effective and efficient management of this resource backed
up by informed decision making through seamless availability of historical and real time data both at the state and national level is, thus, of critical importance.
Due to multiplicity of data producing agencies collecting their domain
specific data, the same is often fragmented, incomplete, dispersed and
heterogeneous making it difficult for policy makers to process it into useful information to support decision making. To overcome these challenges National
Water Informatics Centre (NWIC) has been set up by the Government of India in 2018 to act as central repository of data on water resources and allied themes.
Though, NWIC is maintaining nationwide digital water database and
associated spatial data for the country and disseminates it through a digital
platform (India-WRIS), there is state specific micro level & demand side data
which can be better collected and maintained by the states themselves. This has
led to the concept of establishment of State Water Informatics Centre (SWIC) at
state/UT level. The major role expected to be performed by SWIC is to collect
data from different state departments/agencies, digitization as per standard formats, validation and populating the same in state specific data base. NWIC
would be hand holding states in this much needed endeavour by arranging
requisite hardware and software, preparation of data-base, development of
analytical tools, generic products and decision support system for SWIC to
operate at budgetary support from states.
Government of India, Ministry of Jal Shakti, Department of water
Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation vide their letter dated
12/05/2021 & 24/01/2022 has directed to set State water Informatics Centre
(SWIC) as a dedicated organisation for co-ordination, collection and
dissemination of water resources data of the state with the support and guidance
from National Water Informatics Centre (NWIC).
