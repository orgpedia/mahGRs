According to the order, the decision to take back the Veer and Bhatghar hydroelectric projects to the Water Resources Department was taken as the leases had stopped due to the expiry of the stipulated 35 years of life of the project. It was approved by the Ministry of Water Resources and Energy in 2010. The Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) has been asked to decide on the transfer of the project back to the Water Resources Department as the project is owned by the Water Resources Department. Order dated 14.12.2009. Accordingly, the Veer Hydro Electric Project has been transferred by the Department of Power to a private promoter on BOT basis for undertaking Renovation and Modernization (R& M) of the project and thereafter for operation.
