Government Decision No. 2. Narrow- 2016/27/2016/ LAPA-02, dated 26.05.2017.
The Proposal:
There is an approach road from Tondapur Fardapur road to reach the left side of the Tondapur Medium Project. This road connects to the observation path on the lower side of the left earthen platform. Large potholes have been created on the road and the footpath. The huge potholes and chock-a-block roads obstruct the entry of vehicles and other vehicles of senior officials who come for regular inspection of the dam. Vehicles were also damaged. Due to the potholes on the inspection path, farmers in the dam area use the road above the soil level. The use of vehicles such as bullock carts and tractors is affecting the safety of the dam by changing the concept of the dam. In view of the above, it is very important to repair the surface of the 1800 meter long stretch of this road so that the farmers of the area do not use the road above the soil level. The local people's representatives, the water utility and the farmers of the area had demanded this work from time to time. 2 In exercise of the powers conferred on the Department by the Government decision herein, the matter of granting administrative approval to the special amendment proposal for the said repair work was under consideration of the Government.
