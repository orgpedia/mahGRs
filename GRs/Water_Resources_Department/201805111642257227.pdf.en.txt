Preamble: AIBP and CAD under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana implemented by Water Resources Department
While disbursing funds to the projects under WM, two funds for disbursement under PFMS system
Separate accounts should be opened. Instructions for making payments through this system from 1.4.2018
have been provided. The government has taken a decision. As on 28.3.2018, AIBP and CAD-WM
Instructions have been given to transfer the unaccounted amount up to 31.3.2018 to two separate accounts.
PFMS due to pending training of officers/ staff at Divisional level (Checker& Maker)
Disbursement of funds to maintain physical progress of projects as the system is difficult to fully implement
As it is necessary to do so, under the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana, two schemes namely AIBP and CAD-WM have been included.
The process of disbursement of funds to existing projects should be done through PFMS instead of the existing method.
The matter was under consideration of the government.
Government's decision:
AIBP and CAD under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana implemented by Water Resources Department
The process of disbursing funds to the projects under the two WM schemes is currently in vogue instead of PFMS
This will be allowed till May 31, 2018.
The process of disbursement of funds to the projects should be done entirely through the PFMS system.
