To decide on a strategy for proper planning of water saved by the tube distribution system.
The Government of Maharashtra
The Department of Water Resources
Government Resolution No: Irrigation 2023/ P.S. No. 11/2023/ JAS (Policy)
Mantralaya, Mumbai- 400 032
Date: 19.04.2023
Preamble: The policy of the Government is to give priority to micro-irrigation by making optimum use of available water. The use of closed tube distribution system saves the cost of land acquisition. It also saves water and saves energy. In conventional canal system evaporation of water is avoided in closed tube distribution system. Following this. The policy on closed tube distribution system has been prescribed by Government Decisions dated 13.01.2017 and 18.01.2017. Norms/ guidelines on Pipeline Distribution System Policy have been circulated as per Government Circular dated 02.02.2017. A handbook on Pipeline Distribution System has also been published.
Accordingly, as per the report received from the Irrigation Development Corporation under the Water Resources Department, an estimated 1,01,276 area has been directly irrigated through the use of tube well distribution system at present.
Closed tube distribution system. 1.9 of Circular dated 02.02.2017 reads as under:" While determining the area of benefit of irrigation projects in the State, two terms namely Cultivable Area (CCA) and Planned Irrigation Area (ICA) are considered. Generally, CCA is 70% to 80% of ICA.
Therefore, the area under cultivation is actually more than the available water. Farmers cannot be prevented from using this water. Also, the project concept does not provide for private irrigation from reservoirs and canals within permissible limits. Similarly, due to increasing urbanization and industrialization, excess water over the project provisions is diverted from time to time for non-irrigation purposes. As a result, most of the irrigation projects in the state have been affected. The objective should be to fill the gap created in the original declared benefit area from the water saved by pipe distribution and to bridge the gap between CCA and ICA. However, the government should not propose an increased irrigation area outside the approved benefit area of the project without prior approval. "
Government Decision: As per the said provision, the water saved by pipe distribution is meant to be supplied to the remaining area in the CCA within the beneficiary area. However, at present, various proposals are being received to divert water from the areas saved due to piped water supply. A political decision has to be taken. Accordingly, a Committee is being constituted to propose amendments in the Pipeline Distribution System Policy as follows:
