Introduction: Various projects under the Water Resources Department are under construction. A large number of materials are used in the construction of these buildings. Also, sand is widely used as a filter material in soil treatment.
Alternatively, it requires a lot of water. The demand for construction sand is increasing due to the abundance of natural sand. As a result, illegal sand mining has increased and the natural flow of rivers and drains has increased. In such a situation, it is advisable to reduce the use of natural sand in construction to some extent and instead increase the use of artificial sand. The Regional Engineer of Water Resources Department has also pointed out that the availability of natural sand has adversely affected the progress of construction of irrigation projects.
A government order was being issued in this regard. Following instructions have been issued by the government in this regard.
Circulars:
1) Crushed stone sand should be used instead of natural sand obtained from river channels, considering the field conditions arising in various works undertaken under the Water Resources Department and if natural sand is not available in sufficient quantity near the worksite.
(a) Works under the current tender: No prior approval of the Chief Engineer concerned will be required to use artificial sand in place of natural sand. Before using artificial sand instead of natural sand for works under tender in progress, a decision on the possible changes in the approved tender conditions should be taken by the technical approval officer of the tender. No additional charges shall be payable for the use of artificial sand in these works in progress and no additional charges shall be payable to the contractor concerned for the use of artificial sand if the concrete contains more than the prescribed quantity of cement. The necessary clauses& specifications for the use of artificial sand should be included in the original tender with the consent of the contractor.
(b) Budgets to be re-approved: Before proposing the use of artificial sand in place of natural sand in the subsequent budgets, the competent authority shall take a decision taking into account both the basic rate of materials and the distance of transportation of materials. The Executive Engineer will be responsible for placing the necessary clauses and specifications in the subsequent tenders regarding the use of this artificial sand.

Before using Crushed Stone Sand (for ongoing construction or new tenders), it will be the responsibility of the concerned Regional Executive Engineer to ensure the following:
3.1. The minimum rate of actual rate of transportation of natural sand and the rate of transportation of artificial sand in the project area concerned shall be proposed at the competent level. The rate assumes the transportation of the stone quarry at a minimum distance from the work area at the time of extraction. However, the contractor will be free to choose the source of artificial sand.
3.2) The artificial sand used for construction should be produced by crushing hard stone from an Automatic Vertical Shaft Impact (VSI) Crusher machine specified in paragraph 3.1.2 of IS 383:2016. To keep the amount of microfins in the sand produced within a certain limit, it is mandatory to connect a wet classifier (washing unit) to the machine.
3.3) The total volume of microfines in artificial sand (materials finer than 75 microns) must be less than 7% by mass.
3.8) Table No.1 of IS 383-2016 (Coarse and Fine Aggregate for Concrete-Specification). As mentioned in section 9, fine aggregate should be graded according to the acceptance grading zone and the test should be carried out at the actual work area/ construction site.
3.5) Before using artificial sand in the compaction, the concerned Regional Executive Engineer shall ensure that all the following tests are carried out according to the IS prescribed for them and their results are in accordance with the prescribed parameters.
a) Sieve Analysis b) Specific Gravity c) Water Absorption
d) Bulk Density e) Test for Silt and Clay f) Fineness Modulus
g) Alkali Aggregate h) Soundness Test i) Deleterious Material Reaction j) Organic Impurities k) Micro fines Content I) Combined flakiness & elongation Index
3.6) Before using artificial sand for composting, the concrete mix design of such composting should be done from the quality control laboratory under the Water Resources Department. If the quality control laboratory is not able to do the composite design in the given time for some reason, then in such a case there is no problem in getting the composite design done from the laboratory under MARI, Nashik or from the private laboratory certified by NABL (National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories). This MIX design should be approved by the technical approving authority.
3.7) Filter material for various components in the soil sample (e.g. Inclined Sand Flitter, Sand Mat, Cross Drain, L-Drain, Pitching, Rocktoe etc.) should be preferred wherever possible.
Where there are limitations on the availability of natural sand, the above-mentioned factors in soil fertility

There is no need to use artificial sand. However, before the use of artificial sand for filter material, the
The base material is based on IS 9429-1999 (Drainage System for Earth and Rockfill Dam).
CDO Code of Practice for Design of Earth Dam
It should be verified.
4) Before giving approval by the competent authority in respect of artificial sand (Issue No. 3) Regarding the quality of artificial sand:
Consider it and make it specific.
By-products during crushing of rocks are not Crushed Stone Sand. Crusher Dust (or Quarry
Dust) produced from fine screening of quarry crushing cannot be called Crushed Stone Sand.
The fine particles obtained, as by-products during crushing of rocks to produce coarse aggregates (by crusher and/or cone crusher) are known as Quarry Rock Fines/ Quarry Dust/
Crusher Dust. These by-product are not suitable for concrete or mortar as they contain higher
percentage of dusty, flaky particles of un-controlled sizes with high water absorbent property. If the
crusher dust is flaky and angular in shape, the workability will be very difficult. There is no plasticity
in the concrete and mortar which makes it even difficult for the mason to work, whereas if it is
cubical in shape with grounded edge, superior gradation and good plasticity to concrete will be
obtained.
5) The executive engineer should check at least 2 samples in the first 7 days after starting the use of artificial sand.
