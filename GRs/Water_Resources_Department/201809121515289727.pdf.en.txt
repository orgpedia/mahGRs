The Proposal:
The Kelzar Medium Project is being constructed near Tatani village, 35 km west of Satana town in Nashik district on the river Aram in the Tapi valley. The project was started in 1972 and completed in 1985. The project was with the construction department since 1985, but the irrigation management was being done by them. The catchment area of the project is 54.39 km2.The total inflow of water is 19.82 dlghm and the proposed utilization is 19.82 dlghm. The total storage available in the dam is 17.10 LMT which is 16.22 LMT. The carrying capacity is 80 cubic feet per second and the irrigated area is 2604 hectares.
On the left canal on the Kelzar project, 2604 hectares of water bodies are being taken up, while on the 58 hectares of the Aram river, 732 hectares of 7 dams, a total area of 3394 hectares is under irrigation. The project has been handed over to the irrigation department since 1991. Kelzar Medium Project, Th. Satana, G. Nasik Left Canal is 20 km directly from Kelzar Dam. The length is the left.
As the canal is located on the foothills of the Alankara Hills, rainwater from the hills causes heavy erosion of soil, stones and debris, causing extensive damage to the canal and the left canal from km 4 to 11. To plug the leakage, it is proposed to lay a closed RCC pipeline as a necessary leak prevention measure and also to strengthen and repair the fill on the canal. The local people's representatives, the water utility and the farmers of the area had demanded this work from time to time. In this regard, Refer No. 2 In exercise of the powers conferred on the Department by the Government decision herein, a proposal to grant administrative approval under a special amendment for the said work was under consideration of the Government.
