Introduction In order to bring uniformity in the accounts and ancillary records of the corporations and their offices under the Water Resources Department, to make the information available through it more useful and easy to use, and to make it possible to update the accounts promptly, necessary instructions regarding computerization of the accounts of the corporations have been given as per Reference No.
At the government level, it should be possible to maintain effective control over the allocation of funds to corporations and their subordinate field offices and the expenditure incurred thereon. In this regard, a Committee of Informed Officers has been constituted as per Reference No. 2 for the purpose of computerization of records.
Accordingly, a new system called Integrated Finance Management System (IFMS) has been developed by the National Informatics Center to develop a system like BEAMS (Budget Estimation, Allocation and Monitoring System).
Reference No. As per the Government Decision of 2021, the system is to be used as a pilot for Maharashtra Krishna Basin Corporation from 1st April, 2021 and on a pilot basis in all Irrigation Corporations from 1st August, 2021.
Prior to the implementation of this system, the heads of departments under Maharashtra Krishna Valley Corporation were issued Reference No. The disbursing officer has been declared under the Government Decision No. 3 and 5.
Similarly, the government was considering to declare 129 heads of departments under Vidarbha Irrigation Development Corporation, Nagpur, Godavari, Marathwada Irrigation Development Corporation, Aurangabad, Tapi Irrigation Development Corporation, Jalgaon and Konkan Irrigation Development Corporation, Thane Corporation as distribution officers. The government has taken the following steps in this regard:
