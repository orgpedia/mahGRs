Introduction: The Shahanur Medium Project is built on the Shahanur River near Waghdoh village in Achalpur Taluka of Amravati district. The project has been constructed for flood control in the Tapi valley.
Shahanur is an earthen stone composite dam with a height of 56.45 m from the river bed and a length of 1497 m. Construction of the dam was completed in June 1989 and the canal in June 1990. The project has a methodical approach. There are four naga curves of 8 x 12 size. Under this project, 9330 hectares of area in Anjangaon and Achalpur taluks have been brought under irrigation. Out of the total storage capacity of the project which is 47.60 LMT, live storage is 46.04 LMT and fixed storage is 1.81 LMT.
The construction of the dam is 30 years old and the mud wall of the dam, km stone, information display board of the dam, protective wall near the water tank and protective shield etc. are in bad condition. To control the water level in the dam, it is necessary to install modern water level monitors near the reservoir and near the main outlet. The approach road to Shahanur dam/ the road on the top of the dam was constructed at the time of construction of the dam. The rainwater drains in the main dam should be repaired. After the dam is filled to its full capacity, water seepage is detected from the sluice structure of the aqueduct, which is likely to affect the safety of the dam. The Annual Dam Status Report of Amaravati region for the year 2020-21 has highlighted various shortcomings related to Shahanur Dam.
