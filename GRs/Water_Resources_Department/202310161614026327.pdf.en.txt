Introduction: The Darana project is under the Godavari Irrigation Development Corporation, Aurangabad. The project is located in the Godavari basin. The dam is located at Nandgaon Budruk.
It is built on the Darna River at Igatpuri, Nashik District, upstream of the confluence of the Aundh Nala and the Darna River, in limestone and stone construction. The dam was built to irrigate drought-prone areas of Nashik and Ahmednagar districts. The 110 km long Right Godavari Canal and the 90 km long Godavari Left Canal starting from the Nanduramadhameswarar Unnayi Dam on the Godavari River, 75 km from the Darana Dam, were completed under British funding between 1911 and 1916.
During the rotation in 2022, the old structure of arch hole at 7600 m of Godavari Left Canal collapsed and the rotation was completed with immediate temporary repairs. However, as a permanent solution, it has become necessary to construct a tubular hole (HPD) instead of a masonry arch hole at the site. As per the proposed cut in the Godavari left canal, the discharge of the drain at 7600 mtrs is 1800 mtrs. m and 1400 m. It is proposed to use tubes of NP3 class of diameter.
