It is under excavation. The canal from Canal Chain No. 46 to 47 km is in spate and partly in spate.
Due to the pressure of the flowing water, there has been a huge fall on the inner side of the canal at that place.
This decline in the canal is due to the high rate of erosion, which reduces the carrying capacity of the canal and the irrigation management.
The irrigation area is shrinking due to time constraints. Irrigation is carried out from Paitha to Matha, but
As the canal is not in good condition, more than required water has to be released through the canal. Therefore, the dam
The water storage as well as the water planning done by the Canal Advisory Committee is being affected. So
Irrigation management if canal filling and lining work is renewed and canal rejuvenation
It can be carried out smoothly and a large area can be brought under irrigation. Paithan Main Left Canal Chain
Toe wall with lining of canal erosion at km 46 to 47 proposed
