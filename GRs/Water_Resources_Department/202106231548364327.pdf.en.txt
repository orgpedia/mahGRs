Government Decision No. CDA-2021/ S. No. 37/21/ Grants (Works)
Ministry, Mumbai- 400 032.
The date: June 23, 2021.
Reference: Government Resolution No. CDA2018/ PR No. 152/18/ Laakshevi (Works), D. 21/07/2020.
The Proposal:
Under the office of the Superintending Engineer and Joint Director, Irrigation Research Department, Pune under the Directorate of Irrigation Research and Development, Pune, the work of eradicating the affected area by determining the affected area in the benefit area of the canal of large and medium projects is done. Such land needs to be improved. Otherwise, they become unsuitable for cultivation and the yield decreases.
The survey of saline/ saline lands in the benefit areas of large and medium projects of the Water Resources Department and the works of char schemes are carried out with government funds. However, the government has already directed to conduct the survey for the land in the benefit of private and cooperative irrigation schemes only from the government fund. Representations of various public representatives, starred questions in the Legislative Council, (promises), half-hour discussions, etc. were raised to bridge this gap.
In fact, the private and cooperative irrigation schemes are jointly set up and run by the farmers at their own cost. This will help in saving water and saving the government's expenditure. The country's agricultural and rural economy has grown. Many schemes have been in operation for 30-40 years. The type of soil in the beneficiary areas of these schemes, lack of drainage, soil quality, etc. have led to increased soil salinity over time. As the government does not provide funds for their improvement, the land remains unutilized and water resources are wasted. This caused huge losses to the state and farmers. The government is taking this situation seriously. As per the Government decision dated 21.07.2020, private and cooperative lift irrigation schemes have been directed to be done from the government funds.
The Office of the Executive Engineer, Irrigation Research Department, Pune, has proposed the scheme as a pilot project for underground char scheme for desilting of saline and wet lands in the benefit areas of such private and cooperative lift irrigation schemes under research. underground variable

Due to the scheme, there is no need to acquire agricultural land and the price of agricultural land is increasing.
Farmers benefit from private and cooperative irrigation schemes.
To improve the texture of the land, the government was considering giving administrative approval to the Sub Surface Drainage Scheme to eradicate Kharaba and Kharapad areas. A decision in this regard is being taken.
Government's decision:
To improve the texture of the alkaline lands, the Government of the Water Resources Department has issued an order to the following pilot sub-surface drainage scheme in Sangli district to eradicate Kharaba and alkaline areas. Administrative approval is being granted hereby subject to the condition that it will be complied with 21/07/2020.
