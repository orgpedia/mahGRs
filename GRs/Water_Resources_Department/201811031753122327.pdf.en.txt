To constitute a committee to suggest a sustainable solution regarding the electricity payments of the government irrigation schemes in the state.
The Government of Maharashtra
The Department of Water Resources
Government Resolution No. Committee- 0918/ No. 578/18/ MP 1
Hutatma Rajguru Chowk, Madam Cama Marg,
Ministry, Mumbai- 400 032.
The date: November 3, 2018.
The Proposal:
2000 with a view to financially empowering the farmers by providing irrigation facilities through sub-irrigation in places where it is not possible to provide irrigation facilities through the fluvial system in order to fully utilize the available water in the various river basins of the State. The government has taken up several irrigation projects. Many of these schemes are partially/ fully operational and are largely driven by urgent measures to overcome operational constraints.
The major operational problem is power outages due to non-payment of electricity bills on time. As a result, despite availability of water, the schemes remain closed due to lack of power supply and ultimately adversely affect agricultural production and income. The government has formed a committee to find a permanent solution to the problem. A decision in this regard is being taken.
A committee is being constituted to make concrete recommendations to the government in accordance with the prevailing policy in this regard, after a comprehensive review in this regard, such as suggesting a solution plan in this regard, the problem of electricity payments by farmers, the problems in the field of collecting electricity and water bills and the measures to be taken to increase the irrigation area created by efficiently running the sub-irrigation schemes under the functions of all the corporations in the state.
