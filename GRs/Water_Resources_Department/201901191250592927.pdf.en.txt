Introduction: Agashi Kharbhoomi Scheme, Taluka Vasai, District Palghar is included in the Kharbhoomi Scheme. The Union Forest Ministry has exempted the scheme under the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Act 1991. The total length of the project is 3710 m. The project is located on the right bank of the Vaitarna Main Creek. The scheme is board time and was built in 1978 and has not been renewed. At that time, the project was under construction. Due to incessant tidal waves and heavy rainfall, the embankment has been eroded and the embankment above 0 m, 645 m and 1035 m has been damaged. Most of the project area has been affected due to the collapse of the embankment and the weakening of the embankment. This inflicted heavy loss on the farmers. This plan needs to be revised. The dam and embankment of the original plan are not in accordance with the new technical standards of the government.
Therefore, it is necessary to update the scheme according to the new technical standards. As there was a strong written demand from the gram panchayat, beneficiaries and public representatives to take up this scheme immediately, the proposal to give administrative approval to the renovation work of the Agashi Kharbhoomi Scheme received under the reference letter from the Chief Engineer, Water Resources Department, Konkan Region, Mumbai was under the consideration of the government. Accordingly, the government has taken the following steps:
Government Decision: The administrative approval for the renovation of Agashi Kharbhoomi Yojana, Taluka Vasai, District Palghar has been given to the Department of Kharbhoomi on the basis of the 2016-17 schedule of Rs. 272.13 lakh (Rupees Two Hundred and Seventy Two integer Thirteen only).
