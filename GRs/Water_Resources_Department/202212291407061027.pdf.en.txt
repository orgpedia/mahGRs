The increase in the project cost was due to increase in tariff during construction, increase in tender acceptance of higher rates, increase in cost of land acquisition (especially under the new Land Acquisition Act), increase in change in concept, increase in inadequate provision and other incidental costs. The Maharashtra Krishna Basin Irrigation Development Corporation has submitted a proposal for the fifth revised administrative sanction to the government.
