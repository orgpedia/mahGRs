The proceedings as per the order dated 22/9/2017 shall be conducted by the Member Secretary of the Canal Advisory Committee for the concerned project. Detailed orders should be issued. " After this action, the water available category-wise needs to be distributed among the water users. The definition of" quota" in Section 2 (d) of the Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority Act 2005, Chapter 1 is as follows.
" Quota" means" made available to the holder of the right to use water."
The volumetric quantity of water is calculated by multiplying the authority of water use by the percentage of annual or seasonal water allocation. Accordingly, the quota is fixed i.e. the river basin agency is the competent authority to grant the annual bulk water entitlement i.e. the annual volumetric quota. However, it was advisable to decentralize this authority/ power and delegate it at the field level so that every user-wise process is completed at the corporation level every year within the prescribed time frame.
