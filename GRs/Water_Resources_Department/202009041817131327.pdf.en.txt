The maximum height is 77 meters. The total live storage available in the dam is 974.188 Dalghami (34.403 LH) and total live storage available is 779.348 Dalghami (27.522 LH). The water is used for irrigation, drinking and industrial purposes. 87,000 under the Varana project. 28035 under Area and Wakurde Upazila Irrigation Scheme. The total area is 1150. Many areas will be under water.
Out of 87000 hectare benefit area of Warana Project, 46078 is covered. This area is planned to be irrigated under the Varana River Upasana Irrigation Project. For this, a total of 9 K.P. embankments have been constructed from Warana Dam to Warana Krishna Sangam on the Warana River.
Of these, the Mangle-Sawarde dam was built in 1979 and has been collecting water since 1979. The total length of the dam is 109.40 m. The height is 6.45 meters. There are a total of 24 posts. The dam has a maximum storage capacity of 5.56 LMT (Dalghami) and a project irrigation potential of 10015 ha.

Project Irrigation The water to be released for Mhaisal lift irrigation scheme, as well as the water to be released to the state of Karnataka, the water to be released to the city of Latur, these dams have to be stored up to the full storage level at most times. On the left side of this dam are Chincholi, Mangaon and Adhobajus Kodoli dam.
The construction of the dam was completed in 1979 and it has taken 40 years. The roof of the building is broken in many places. As a result, it becomes difficult to tie the knot. The dam can store water up to 546.45 m. As there is no iron channel in the bed of the dam, the stones in the masonry are exposed due to water pressure. Alternatively, the iron bars are then swept away from the bottom. Most of the walls of the dam have been damaged and some of the walls have collapsed. Also, a lot of water is leaking from the bottom of the dam and from the seals.
The level of the dam has been damaged. The construction of the lower part of the pillar level has potholes. Also, the construction of the building is in a dilapidated condition due to continuous waterlogging. In some areas, there are cracks and cracks in the walls.
If the damaged peeler is not repaired as mentioned above, the irrigation system can be shut down at any moment, causing huge losses. Also, there is a possibility of a major damage to the structure in the future. Also, due to special repair of Co. P. Dam, Dam No. 5792 has been constructed. Since the area is going to be restored, the repair of the existing embankment must be done on priority. Recommendations have been made in the Pre-monsoon and Post-monsoon Monitoring Reports for 2015-16,2016-17 and 2017-18.
After the completion of this work, 5792 of the Mangle Saverde Co. P. Dam was completed. area will be restored. In this regard, Government Resolution No. A proposal to grant administrative approval under a special amendment for this work in the exercise of the authority granted to the department under the Government Decision No. 2 and 3 was under consideration of the Government.
