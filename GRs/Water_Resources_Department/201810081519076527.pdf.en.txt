Preamble: Integrated water management and market access is now considered as an important step to promote doubling farmers' income and more crop-per-drop schemes in the state.
While Water Resources Department is responsible for' off-farm' activities, other departments, farmers and Water User Associations (established under the Maharashtra Management of Irrigation System by Farmers Act, 2005) contribute to the' on-farm' activities. These include adoption of micro-irrigation systems, improved cultivation practices, water conservation and choosing appropriate crops. Water use efficiency in Maharashtra is low and current adoption of micro irrigation systems is also low.
There are currently about 5000 WUAs in the state and their capacity to manage water supplied to them and also promote water use efficiency and productivity is weak, barring a few. Secondly, the required backward and forward linkages for inputs and marketing support for marketing their produce is also weak, with a few exceptions. The role of private sector is mainly limited to supplying inputs, equipment and buying their produce for further marketing and value addition.
Government of Maharashtra is addressing all these issues through schemes such as water conservation through Jalayukt Shivar, subsidies to farmers to adopt micro irrigation, Minimum Support Price for different crops, encouraging formation of Farmer Produce Companies (FPCs) for forward linkages, and recently resolved to encourage private sector to come up with innovating schemes through Swiss Challenge Method (vide GR dated 16th February, 2018). However, these are usually not addressed in an integrated manner, as they are managed by different departments.
GoM formed a Multi-Stakeholder Platform (vide GR dated 18th May, 2017), with technical assistance from 2030-Water Resources Group (2030-WRG), The World Bank, to support the state in bringing multi stakeholders togethers to address critical issues related to water use efficiency and productivity.

1. PIU head shall report progress on monthly basis to Secretary (CAD) and Secretary (Agriculture).
2. In the initial period, the PIU is expected to study, identify pilot project areas, design appropriate PPP models and invite project proponents from private sector for demonstrating integrated implementation of off-farm, on-farm and market linkages for optimum water use efficiency and productivity results. The PIU shall review and
