Introduction: - Tagarkheda is a Latur system dam on the Terna River near Tagarkheda village in Latur district. The barrage is located at a distance of 69.80 km from the site of the Terna Dam. The total projected water storage of the barrage is 0.772 Dalhousie and is 171. There is an irrigated area. The Tarakheda Latur system barrage was completed in 2014 and first commissioned by the Construction Department in 2019. The project has since been transferred to the Department of Management for maintenance and gate management in 2019.
Since the completion of the construction of the project, the work related to the repair of the passages in the dam has not been done. The Chief Engineer (Mechanics), Water Resources Department, Nashik.
On 12/9/2023, he visited various embankments / barrages on Manjra river and certified the need for repair of various machinery and electrical components and gave some suggestions in this regard, including the proposed TRAST embankment. The Executive Director has directed that these works be proposed under special amendment as the required funds for carrying out the proposed works in connection with the repair of mechanical and electrical components of the Takharkheda Dam are not available at the corporation level. The water leakage from the gate will be stopped once the repair work of the mechanical and electrical components of the dam, which is a Latur-style dam, is completed. Also, the project proposed water storage will be available for irrigation during Rabi and Summer seasons at full capacity. The repair will also help in smooth operation of the gate and thus maintain the safety of the dam during flood control.
