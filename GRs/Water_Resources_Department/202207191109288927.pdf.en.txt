Introduction: The government has adopted a policy to increase the production capacity of agricultural land by removing the silt stored in the old dams in the state and also to de-silt the reservoirs of all the dams in the state. 1 has been issued. However, as per the decision of the Government, the process of e-tendering of silt and mixed sand/ sand extraction, which was started in the year 2019, has been cancelled. The main reason for this was that complaints were being received due to ambiguity and contradictions in some aspects in the tender document.
Accordingly, a new committee has been constituted to prepare draft e-tender documents by amending the terms and conditions in the tender document. 3 were made. However, the standard format submitted by the said Committee was given in the tender. As some of the matters are not in conformity with the policy provisions dated 03/08/2018, the Government vide letter No. As the committee established earlier has been dissolved and the standard tender documents have not yet been finalized, the Government is taking a decision to reconstitute the committee to prepare the revised standard draft tender.
Government Decision: Under the Water Resources Department of the State, the Government under reference Decision No. A Committee is being constituted to revise the draft e-tender documents for the contract for desilting of silt and sand/ silt mixed in the major irrigation projects mentioned in Section 1.
