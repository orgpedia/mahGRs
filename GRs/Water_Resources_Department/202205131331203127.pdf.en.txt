Former Chief Minister late Shankarrao Chavan has been a respected member of all the four Houses of the Central and State Legislatures- Rajya Sabha, Lok Sabha, Legislative Council and Legislative Assembly. No one will ever forget his work. He handled the responsibility of the ministry given by the great freedom fighter Swami Ramanandtirtha that the power should be implemented in the interest of the Bahujan. His nature was to work with full dedication in the work undertaken, creating a world from nothing, conscientious, people-oriented, having impeccable character, combining vision and thinking.
His slogan" Pani Adwa Pani Jirwa" became the motto, and he is proudly referred to as the father of water culture. He is described as the modern Bhagiratha because of his efforts to complete many irrigation projects. In memory of the glorious work of such a great man, the Government has decided to honor the work of individuals and organizations doing remarkable work in the field of water resources, water conservation and water supply by awarding them Dr. Shankarraoji Chavan Jal Bhushan Award. The Government decision has been issued on 12/06/2020. As per the decision of the present government, Dr. Shankarrao Chavan Jal Bhushan Award has been provided in his birth centenary year. However, this award is given annually to individuals who have done outstanding work in the field of water resources, water conservation and water supply. The decision has been made 2.
The awards were given to those who have done excellent work in the field of water supply and sanitation, water conservation and irrigation. However, there are notable achievements in this area by a large number of non-governmental organizations, and their participation is worthy of note.

In addition to this, officers/ employees in government service or retired in government service contribute in this field in addition to the work assigned to them voluntarily. This award will be a fitting way to recognize their achievements. Therefore, it is necessary to change the nature of the award and the nature of the information required for the evaluation of these works done in many ways is multifaceted and the criteria to be used for it should be prepared in the same manner. However, it has been pointed out that the criteria used earlier to select the winners need to be changed by competing for the said award in a fair manner. In this regard, there is a need to simplify the evaluation method by studying the criteria of the National Water Award given at the national level.
The award is given on the basis of the performance of Dr Shankarraoji Chavan. It has been observed that the time available for assessment till the birth anniversary on July 14 is insufficient. For this, the government was considering changes in the format and category of the award, the criteria for evaluation and the schedule of the competition. The government is taking the following steps in this regard:
GOVERNMENT DECISIONS: 1. Subject to Government Decision No. As there are partial changes in 1 and 2, they are being superseded and a consolidated notification regarding Jal Bhushan Award is being issued by this Government.
