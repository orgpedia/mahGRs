Introduction: Mula Irrigation Project has two major canals namely Mula Right Bank Canal and Mula Left Bank Canal. The original right bank canal is 52 km long and was completed in 1972-73. The projected water carrying capacity from the origin is 1650 cusecs. The water management of the entire benefit area of the Mula Dam project has been transferred to the Water Utilization Agency since 2006. All water use agencies are functional and water is being metered as per demand at government rates.

| The construction of the original right canal has been completed for 50 years and the canal has been used for kharif, rabi and summer. |
| Irrigation is done in all the three phases for agriculture in the beneficiary areas.                                                  |
| As per the inspection, the original right canal/ branch canal No. 1 is between 27/00 km to 30/00 km and the distributary              |
| There was a lot of damage to the lining at various places in Nos. 3, 4 and 5, leakage and leakage from the canal                      |
| That is, the canal cutoff is less than the projected cutoff and therefore the projected discharge is obtained.                        |
| In some places, many structures on the canal have collapsed and are leaking.                                                          |
| As the filling of the canal was found to be in a dangerous condition, the locals                                                      |
| Since the people's representative has also demanded, the original right canal/ branch canal No. 1 from 27/00 CE                       |
| Special amendment to the budget for the repair of canals in the 30/ 00 km and in section No. 3, 4 and 5                               |
| The proposal for grant of internal administrative approval was under consideration of the Government.                                 |
| is taking.                                                                                                                            |
