Introduction Computerization of the accounts of the Corporations under the Water Resources Department to bring uniformity in the accounts and ancillary records of the Corporations and their offices, to make the information available through it more useful and easy to use and to enable prompt updation of the accounts.
The government should take a decision in this regard. As on 22/07/2015.
In order to ensure effective control over the allocation of funds to the Corporations and their subordinate field offices at the government level and the expenditure incurred thereon, a committee of officers has been constituted to develop a system like BEAMS (Budget Estimation, Allocation and Monitoring System).
Accordingly, a new system called Integrated Finance Management System (IFMS) has been developed by the National Informatics Centre. This system has been first implemented for the Maharashtra Krishna Valley Development Corporation. Reference No. As many as 33 heads of departments under the Maharashtra Krishna Valley Corporation have been declared as disbursing officers to implement the system. But in addition to these 33 department heads, the government is taking a decision to declare 9 other department heads as disbursing officers as follows.
The decision was taken by the Maharashtra Krishna Valley Development Corporation (MKKVDC). 8541 of Scheme No. 84430081 Treasury Office is located in Pune. The Executive Director has been authorised to draw funds from the said personal provident account.
As the newly developed Integrated Finance Management System (IFMS) (extended beams) requires the disbursement of funds from the Corporation's own accounts in the Pune Treasury by the Corporation Subordinate Executive Engineer, the 9 Executive Engineers in the list attached are being declared as" Disbursing Officer under PLA Account."
