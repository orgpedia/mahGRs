As per the provisions of the Maharashtra Rehabilitation of Project Affected Persons Act, 1999, a village affected by an irrigation project is rehabilitated in a new settlement. The project victims face many difficulties while migrating to the rehabilitated villages. Considering the difficulties in the transfer of civic amenities due to the long period of implementation of the project, a definite policy on the maintenance and repair of civic amenities in the rehabilitated villages will ensure better quality of facilities to the project victims. The following decisions are being taken regarding the civic amenities provided to the rehabilitated villages affected by the irrigation projects after 1976 and the civic amenities and their maintenance to be provided to the rehabilitated villages under the project from now on.
Government Decision: 1) The Project Officer should make a provision of 20% of the estimated cost in the budget and deposit this amount in the joint bank account of the Sarpanch and the Village Development Officer of the Gram Panchayat so that after the transfer of civic amenities to the Gram Panchayat, it can be maintained by the Gram Panchayat. The interest of this amount can be used by the Gram Panchayat for the maintenance and repair of the rehabilitated village.
(2) The District Collector shall have the power to grant administrative approval for the repair of civic amenities in the rehabilitated villages where the works of civic amenities have already been carried out but the villages have not been transferred to the Gram Panchayat within a limit of 20% of the expenditure incurred on the civic amenities.
Also, 20% of the original cost incurred on civic amenities while transferring such gaothans to the Gram Panchayat should be deposited in the joint account of the Sarpanch and the Village Development Officer for the purpose mentioned in No. 1.
The above No. 2 Provision of Administrative Sanction mentioned herein for maintenance and repair works of civic amenities in the rehabilitated villages of Gosikhurd Project, Bembla Project and Arunavati Project.
