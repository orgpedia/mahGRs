Reference-1) Government Circular No.PLN-2018/ No.1/ NVS-1D. 11.1.2018
Introduction: It is mandatory to complete the work of the projects included under the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) in a time-bound manner by maintaining the pace of work and accordingly to pay the contractors without delay. The procedure has been prescribed by circular No. 1. Issue number 7 of this circular directs the Executive Engineer to credit the payment amount to the contractor's account through NEFT/ RTGS within a maximum period of seven days after the approval of the Superintending Engineer and the payment is passed. However, it has been observed that the methodology takes a long time to measure the actual work done at the sub-divisional level, resulting in delay in payment of contractors.
Regarding this. Nagpur on 04.03.2018. The Union Water Resources Minister, in a meeting held to review the projects under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY), discussed the issue of payment of works under the scheme without any delay. It was decided to prescribe a revised methodology for payment of work dues of the Prime Minister Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) projects as it is very important for the contractors to get the necessary cash flow to maintain the progress of the work.
Government Circular: The Government Circular of Reference No. 1 had specified the procedure for payment of dues by all Irrigation Development Corporations and their Subordinate Offices for payment of dues for projects under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana. However, the government was considering the issue of timely and immediate payment of dues for the works of these projects as well as the projects under the Baliraja Jal Sanjeevi Yojana.
2. In order to ensure that the payments for the projects included in the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana and Baliraja Jal Sanjeevi Yojana are paid within the prescribed time frame, a new procedure for the distribution of funds by all Irrigation Development Corporations and their subordinate boards and divisional offices should be determined and action should be taken accordingly.

The B-1 tender provides for payment to be made to the contractor twice a month. Accordingly, in the first phase, while preparing the payment for the project work at the sub-divisional level, the work done between 15th and 30th of the previous month should be measured and the payments should be prepared from 1st to 5th of the next month and submitted to the divisional office. Then in the second phase, while preparing the work payments at the sub-divisional level, the work done between 1st and 15th of each month should be measured and the payments for the late work done from 16th to 20th should be prepared and submitted to the divisional office.
After the payment is made in two stages as mentioned above in the divisional office, the divisional office should pay 75 percent of the payment within 48 hours from the time the payment is made. If there is a public holiday within the 48-hour period given to the divisional office, the payments will be allowed on the working day after the public holiday. The remaining amount (25%) is to be paid within one month from the date of submission of payment after due technical and accounting checks.
3) It will be mandatory for the concerned Deputy Engineer to submit the payment to the Divisional Office by the late 5th and 20th of every month. Also, inform the departmental office if any payment is pending.
4) If it will take time to prepare the record of the work done as per the provisions of the Maharashtra Public Works Account Code (MPW Account Code), then one of these two payments may be the work done but not measured. However, the next payment must be a measured bill.
5) The provisions of paragraph 10.2.16 of the Maharashtra Public Works Account Code (MPW Account Code) should be followed while adopting the procedure for payment of contractor's dues as above. Review of payment of works of contractors as per the proposed procedure within the stipulated time should be done at the level of Chief Engineer. The information in the following form should be submitted to the government and the Chief Accounts and Finance Officer (C.A.F.O.) at the corporation level without fail on the 15th and 30th of every month.
