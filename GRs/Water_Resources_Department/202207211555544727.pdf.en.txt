Introduction: Jayakwadi Project is under the Godavari Irrigation Development Corporation Aurangabad under the Chief Engineer and Chief Administrator Benefit Area Development Authority, Aurangabad. The Jayakwadi project is one of the most ambitious projects in Maharashtra. The work of Jayakwadi Dam was started in 1965 and completed in 1976. The Jayakwadi left canal irrigates an area of about 14,1640 hectares in the three districts of Aurangabad, Jalna and Parbhani.
Paithan Main Left Canal Chain No. 39 to 40 Km. The canal is full and partially full and the pressure of the flowing water has caused a large amount of erosion on the inner side of the canal at that place. Because of the high rate of decline in the canal, the carrying capacity of the canal is decreasing and the irrigation area is decreasing by creating problems during irrigation management. As the canal is not in good condition, more water has to be released through the canal than required. This is affecting the water storage in the dam as well as the water planning done by the canal advisory committee. Therefore, in order to ensure smooth irrigation management and to provide water to the project irrigation area with the planned discharge capacity, the government was considering to give administrative approval under special amendment to the work of repairing and lining the erosion of the canal area in the Paithan Main Left Canal Chain No. 39 to 40 km. The government has taken the following decisions:
