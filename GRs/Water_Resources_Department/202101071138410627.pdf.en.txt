Read: Govt. Purani-2018/ (Q.No. 182/2018)/ S.V. (Revenue) D. On the 3rd May 2018
Preamble: Department of Water Resources, Government Circular No.Poorni-2018/ (P.No. 182/2018)/ CV (Revenue) No. As on 3rd May, 2018, guidelines have been issued for delineation of floodplains and use of prohibited and controlled areas to avoid any construction within the floodplains to avoid possible flood risk.
The circular provides for the definition of blue flood line, red line, prohibited and controlled area and the information on the purposes for which the prohibited and controlled area is to be used and the responsibilities thereon. However, due to heavy rainfall during the 2019 monsoon season, the actual flood water levels observed at many places were found to be much higher than the red flood line levels. Therefore, it has been observed that the water level above the Lalpur line level has created difficulties in giving early warning to the people of the affected areas and shifting them to safer places. Accordingly, the matter of issuing guidelines regarding the yellow flood line and the areas between the red and yellow flood lines, in addition to the blue and red flood lines, was under the consideration of the government. In this regard, the following circular is being issued as a follow-up to the guidelines issued vide Government Circular dated 3rd May, 2018:
Circular: 1) This circular shall be a continuation of the circular dated 3rd May, 2018 issued by the Department of Water Resources, Government of India vide Circular No. Purani-2018/ (PROCESS. 182/2018) SINYA (REVENUE).
2) The concept of Yellow Line is being introduced through this circular.
Yellow Line: The line drawn in accordance with the maximum flood level actually observed above the red flood line level should be called the yellow flood line.
Alert Zone: The area between the red flood line of the river and the yellow flood line on the same bank should be called an alert zone.
There will be no ban on construction activities in this alert area, however, it will be easier to provide early warning to the people of this area during the flood situation. Also, citizens and investors in this sector will be informed about the potential risks and risks.
In all the maps, the concerned chief engineer should ensure that the yellow line is followed. And henceforth, the blue and red lines as well as the yellow line in respect of all rivers should be fixed and approved by the MA. The year in which this maximum direct flood line was observed on this line should be noted. All three lines as above should be displayed on the map and published on the website.

If the red and blue lines have already been approved, in which case the yellow line is higher than the red line, then all such maps should be revised and republished.
