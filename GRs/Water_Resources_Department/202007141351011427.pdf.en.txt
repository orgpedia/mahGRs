Amended Government Resolution No. Narrow- 2019/ (112/2019)/ JJ
Madam Cama Marg, Hutatma Rajguru Chowk,
Mantralaya, Mumbai 400 032
Date: 29th of June 2020
Reference: 1. The meeting was chaired by the Chief Minister and State Water Resources Minister. Meeting held on 24/7/2019.
2) Government Decision, Water Resources Department No. Narrow- 2019/ (112/2019)/ JSA, Dy. 17/9/2019
The Proposal:
The region of Marathwada in the Godavari basin and the region in the Girna (Tapi) sub-basin are highly drought prone and continuously drought prone. Since the natural availability of water is low, the only option available is to divert the excess water from the Konkan region.
For this, after a detailed survey, the schemes that will be financially viable will be approved and their work will be started. The water can be diverted to catchment areas of Pune, Gangapur, Waghad, Karanjawan, Bhandardara, Mula, Kadwa, Mukne, Bhawali etc. in Godavari river basin in Marathwada adjoining Nar-Par, Damanganga, Ulhas and Vaitarna basins in Konkan and further to Jayakwadi dam in Marathwada.
Also, the water can be diverted into the canal.
In the Cabinet meeting held on 30.07.2019, the Water Resources Department made a presentation on the proposed river linking project to divert water from the Western Vahini river basin to Marathwada and Girna (Tapi) basin in Godavari basin. In the presentation, a detailed discussion was held on the river linking project as well as the proposal put forward by the Water Resources Department. The Chief Minister has given in-principle approval to take further action in the following matters.
The inter-State Damanganga-Pinjal river linking project and inter-State inter-State river linking projects at Nar-Par-Girna, Par-Godavari, Damanganga-Vaitran-Godavari and Damanganga-Ekdare-Godavari should be taken up expeditiously with State funds, not as national projects. The project will provide 31.60 lh of water to Mumbai city, 25.60 lh of water to Marathwada region of Godavari basin and 10.76 lh of water to Tapi basin from Konkan.

GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: PARIS- 2019/ (112/2019)/ JASS
A total of 360 million cubic feet of additional water is available in Ulhas, Vaitarna, Nar-Par and Damanganga basins of the Western Bahini river basin (Konkan). This excess water can be diverted to Godavari and Girna (Tapi) basins. For this, detailed survey and investigation of new river linking schemes should be undertaken immediately and detailed project reports of viable schemes should be prepared.
Accordingly, a preliminary study on the proposed schemes in the Integrated State Water Plan for diverting surplus water from the Western Vahini river basin (Konkan) to Marathwada and Girna sub-basin has been initiated. The decision was taken by the government. Since the implementation of the river linking schemes was to be done on a war footing, the inclusion of additional members and increasing the scope of the committee was under the consideration of the government. Accordingly, Reference No. The Governing Decision of 2 is being superseded and the revised Governing Decision is as follows:
Government's decision:
Preliminary on the plans proposed in the Integrated State Water Plan for diverting surplus water from the Western Vahini river basin (Konkan) to Marathwada and Girna (Tapi) sub-basin
