The Proposal: -
Under the Janai Upasa Irrigation Scheme, the new Muttah is 94 km through the right canal.
A sub-irrigation scheme called Janai has been proposed by releasing water from the middle Varvand lake.
The project is being implemented through a scheme in Daund, Baramati and Purandar taluks of Pune district.
8350 in the catchment areas. The area will benefit from irrigation. Janai Upasana Irrigation
18 tanks in the beneficiary area of the scheme to be filled with excess water during the monsoon season.

Pune city's water consumption is increasing day by day due to the increasing population in the future.
It is impossible for the Janai Shirsai Upsa Irrigation Project to get the planned 3. 6 TMC of water. So
In the future, the irrigated area will be reduced by providing water to less area than the actual irrigated area.
The Janai Shirsai Upsa Irrigation Scheme is operational in the catchment area. the above-mentioned
The amount of rainfall within the scope of the scheme is very low. as well as marmalade land in hilly areas.
As a result, there is a large amount of water leakage due to seepage. There is also high humidity in the area.
The rate results in a greater loss of water. All the canals in the scheme are open-ended.
As a result, the leakage rate is high. The work on these canals in the scheme has been going on for about 25 years.
Many of the canals have reached their full capacity due to their age and low availability of water.
No. It is damaging the canal system and causing more damage day by day.
No land acquisition is required due to the duct system. as well as any hindrance to the exercise
It's not coming. It is easier to distribute equitable water through tube distribution. The distribution of the tube
The cost of maintenance, repair, and operation of the system is also relatively low. On the slopes of the mountains,
The cost of maintenance is relatively high on deep dug and black mud canals.
Though the project gets water from the Khadakwasla project, the project is in a closed pipeline.
Conversion will result in efficient use of water and save water for Pune Municipal Corporation.
The water supply will reduce the stress on the Khadakwasla project. The plan is closed.
Converting into a tube will reduce water losses and the lakes covered under the scheme.
It will be possible to fill the pool by having the necessary tops available for it to be filled.
Against this backdrop, the canals of the Janai Shirsai Upsa Irrigation Scheme have been provided with closed channels.
Administrative approval of the extension and modification proposal for conversion to the system.
The Government is taking the following decisions as per the consideration of the Government.
