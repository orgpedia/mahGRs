Government Resolution No. Narikari- 2021/ P. No. 95/ N.S. 2
Mantralaya, Mumbai 400032
The date: August 30, 2021.
Reference:- (1) Government Order, Water Resources Department, SAMRIDH-2017/ S.No.255/ BASE 1, Dy. 27.02.2018 2) Government Circular No. Section 1010/ Q. No. 184/2010/ Mechanics, Dy. 20.10.2010
The Proposal:
" Contract management" is an important component for timely completion of water resources projects in the state. Before any work of the project is undertaken, the process of surveying, investigating, conceptualizing, budgeting, inviting tenders and issuing work order to the contractor takes a lot of time. The delay in completion of the project has led to a rise in the cost of the project. To avoid this, the process of implementation of Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPC) mode of tendering has been made mandatory for the projects under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana in the state. 1 of the Government Resolution No. 3 has been implemented.
As per the Annual Plan 2021-22, out of 270 under construction projects in the State, 104 projects are planned to be completed in the next two years. Apart from this, the remaining irrigation projects also need to be given the desired speed. The government was considering to implement the Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) tender system for other projects besides the projects under the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) to complete the under-construction projects in the state in a time-bound manner.
Government's decision:
Reference No. Issue No. 1. 3 The Government has decided to implement the Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) tender system in the State for other under-construction projects in addition to the projects under the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana. The Executive Director of the concerned corporation will have the authority to implement the EPC tender process on a case to case basis. The Executive Director shall decide on the procedure for inclusion of mechanical and electrical work in the proposed tender in accordance with the requirement and rationale of the work while tendering the work of EPC system. Also Reference No. The Government Circular issued under Section 2 is now being superseded.
