The National Green Tribunal, Pune has issued a notice to the State Government on Petition No. The order dated 27/5/2015 dated 25/2014 had also directed to draw an interim flood line as a precautionary measure for the period till the final flood line is fixed.
As per the provisions of the aforesaid direction, the Municipal Corporations, Local Bodies, Municipalities, Municipal Councils shall not consider the area as construction area within a minimum distance from the interim blue line before the completion of the final flood line.
Interim blue lines of this type are in order to be drawn on priority rivers or on other rivers during the period till/ during the final flood line is drawn. This will help in preventing encroachments/ construction activities. In order to bring more clarity and accuracy in this regard, it was under the consideration of the Government to issue such guidelines supplementing the circulars at Reference 1 and 2.
