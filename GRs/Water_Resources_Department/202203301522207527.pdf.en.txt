Introduction: The construction of Sorna Medium Project in Mohadi Taluka was completed in 1971 and the project has been transferred for irrigation management and maintenance repair. The project is located in the Penganga sub-basin of the Godavari basin. The project has been constructed on a local drain near Sorana village. The maximum height of the earthen dam is 14.33 m. The project also has a 106.68-metre-long shaft of free-flowing construction. The total live storage available in Sorana Dam is 6.172 Dalghami and total live storage is 5.733 Dalghami. For irrigation, the left canal is 6.30 km and the right canal is 6.77 km. The cultivable area (CCA) of the project is 1553. The irrigated area is 933. It is 1091. It is a contract area.
From the data of water storage in the last 13 years, it is seen that the Sorana project fills up only 75%. If the project is completed, it will be 1091 in the kharif season. The area is irrigated. The beneficiaries of Sorana project are inclined towards Rabi/ Summer crops after Kharif crops.
The planned benefit area of the Bawanthadi project is 785 ha due to urbanization and thermal power plant.
The area under irrigation is decreasing. This results in saving of 2.21 Dalhousie in the planned water consumption of Bawanthadi project. From this water saving, water can be supplied to Sorna medium project and due to this water availability, Sorna project is 1311. The irrigated area will be covered under more Rabi/ Summer irrigation and this will improve the economic condition of the beneficiaries. For this, a proposal was made to release water from Bawanthadi medium project to Sorana medium project through a supplementary/ filling canal.
In order to achieve this objective, the Government has decided to construct the supplementary canal for the Sorana Medium Project under Government Decision No.36/ 2017/
