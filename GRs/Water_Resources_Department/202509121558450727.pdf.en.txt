The Dongargaon High Level Barrage was completed in 2016 and was first commissioned by the Construction Department in 2016. The project has since been transferred to the Department of Management for maintenance and gate management in 2019.
Since the completion of the construction of the project, the work related to the repair of the passages in the dam has not been done. The Chief Engineer (Mechanics), Water Resources Department, Nashik.
On 12/9/2023, he visited various dams / barrages on Manjra river and certified the need for repair of various mechanical and electrical components and gave some suggestions in this regard, including the proposed Dongargaon dam. The Executive Director has directed that these works be proposed under special amendment as the required funds for carrying out the proposed works in connection with repair of mechanical and electrical components of Dongargaon Dam are not available at the corporation level. Once the repair work of the mechanical and electrical components of the dam is completed, the water leakage from the gate will be stopped. Also, the project proposed water storage will be available for irrigation during Rabi and Summer seasons at full capacity. The repair will also help in smooth operation of the gate and thus maintain the safety of the dam during flood control.
