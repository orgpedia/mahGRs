The Union Forest Ministry has exempted the scheme under the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Act 1991. The total length of the project is 1240 m. The project is located on the right bank of the Vasai Main Creek and Kaman Sub Creek. The scheme is board time and was built in 1978 and has not been renewed. At that time, the project was under construction. Due to incessant tidal waves and heavy rainfall, the embankment has been eroded and the embankment has suffered extensive damage, and the embankments above Chain No. 5 meters and Chain No. 760 meters have been broken and damaged. Most of the project area has been affected due to the collapse of the embankment and the weakening of the embankment.

Therefore, it is necessary to update the scheme according to the new technical standards. As there was a strong written demand from the gram panchayat, beneficiaries and public representatives to take up this scheme immediately, the proposal to give administrative approval to the renovation work of Bapane Kharbhumi Yojana, received under the reference letter from the Chief Engineer, Water Resources Department, Konkan Region, Mumbai, was under the consideration of the government.
