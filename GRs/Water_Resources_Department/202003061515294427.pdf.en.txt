The proposal: Banpethwadi is a village on the Pandharpur-Chilani state highway, about 40 km from Karad.
At a distance Banpethwadi (Yerad) village is situated on the left bank of Koyna river. The Koyna dam, located near Haygaon village on the Koyna river, has a storage capacity of 105 TMC. The maximum discharge from the six sluice gates of Koyna Dam during the monsoon season 2005-2006 is 1,10,000 cusecs. In August 2011, 1,30,000 cusecs of water was released into the Koyna river. The flood situation is caused by the rainfall in the upper free catchment area of Banpethwadi (Yerada) village and the water released from Koyna dam. Buildings, homes, and roads are destroyed. Also, due to the steep slope of the river, the land on the right bank of the river is being eroded by the flood and the river bank adjacent to the village is becoming unstable. This poses a threat to the village. The villagers have spent around Rs. The building was constructed at a cost of Rs. 15 lakh. The wall collapsed during the June 2011 monsoon season due to heavy rains and excessive discharge into the Koyna river, posing a threat to the Yedoba temple and the nearby settlement. This demand was made by the gram panchayat. Patan, G. Satara passed resolution No. 5, d. 18.8.2016. Shri Shambhuraje Desai, Member of Legislative Assembly, Shri. The Minister of State for Home (Rural), Finance, Planning, State Excise, Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, Shri Panan has made noteworthy suggestions in the last 2-3 sessions. The matter is also mentioned in the letter dated 4/2/2020
