The Proposal:
The Koyna Hydroelectric Project Phase 4 is a project on the Koyna River in Koynanagar Taluk. patan, G.
It is located in Satara. The power plant of the project is located at Alore, Ta. It was built at Chiplun, G. Ratnagiri. Koyna Hydroelectric Project Phase 4 Scheme Koyna Project Phase 1 & 2 (Total installed capacity 600 MW) VAT) is supplemented by. The project was granted administrative approval vide Government Decision No. HEP 1982/270 JAVI & ARP dated 2nd July 1985 at a cost of Rs. This includes a total of 750 May.
Wattage (125 "6) was assumed. Thereafter, in accordance with the study conducted in the subsequent period and as per the instructions of Central Electricity Authority, New Delhi, an amount of Rs. It was decided to install 4 generators of watt capacity. Thus, the total installed capacity is 750 MW. May 1000 off the bat. There was a flood up to Watt. In view of this increase, the government has decided to implement Government Decision No. 1 as the cost of construction of the project is expected to be more than the original admin approved cost. KOY-1092 / (390/1992) Javi, D. The Koyna Hydroelectric Project Phase-IV under 30.07.1998 has been completed at a cost of Rs. The budget of ₹1 crore was first approved by the revised administrator. All four sets of the Koyna Hydroelectric Project Phase-IV were commissioned between 1999 and 2000 and the power generation from the plant was started.
In the meantime, the Maharashtra Krishna Basin Development Corporation, which was set up to expedite the works of fully utilising the waters of Maharashtra's share due to the decision of the Krishna Water Dispute Tribunal for irrigation in the east, planned several irrigation projects. This new sub-irrigation scheme has necessitated the release of 50 billion cubic feet of water, offsetting the earlier use of 30 billion cubic feet of water. To meet this increased water demand, the two components that had to be added to the project's scope were the extension of the length of the Koyna Hydroelectric Project Phase-IV overhead tunnel and the installation of a 5-feet-high valve across the curves of the Koyna Dam, as modifications to the water transport system of the completed Koyna Hydroelectric Project Phase-IV had to be made mandatory. Due to the flood in the scope of the project, a sum of Rs.

1987.61 The budget has been allocated to the Government Decision, Water Resources Department No. Koyna 1002 / (120/03) Javi, D. A second revised administrator was approved under 07.02.2006.
Subsequently, the estimated cost of the project was compounded by factors such as the increase in the work to be done according to the detailed diagrams actually done according to the regional geologic conditions, the increase in the volume of the works due to the weak rock that was heavily used in the excavation during the actual work of the underground tunnel expansion, the price increase due to the fact that most of the work had to be done from the reservoir itself, the cost increase, (02102 Escalation), the amount to be deposited in the court due to the Tae cases, and the associated cost. Hence, the cost of the project is higher than the second revised administrator approved price of Rs. 2457.15 The budget has been allocated to the Government Decision, Water Resources Department No. Koyna 1208 / (90/08) / Javi, D. A third revised administrator was approved under 09.06.2008.
