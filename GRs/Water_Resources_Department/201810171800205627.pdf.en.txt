Introduction: 1.0 Section 11 (d) of the Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority Act provides for the determination of water tariff in such a manner as to reflect the recovery of the entire cost of administrative operation and maintenance of the irrigation system and the criteria for calculating the water tariff at the sub-basin, river basin and state level through MANIPRA and fix the water tariff accordingly.
As per 2.0, the water rates were fixed for the years 2010 to 2013 as per the decision of the Government in the context. Thereafter, the water tariff rates could not be revised due to various reasons.
Therefore, the water tariff rates fixed for the period from 2010 to 2013 were extended as per the government order.

Subsequently, the Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority Order No. 1/2018 dated 11th January, 2018 as well as Corrigendum Order No. 1/2018 and Order No. As per Order No. 2/2018, for the period from 1st February, 2018 to 30th June, 2020, for the water used for domestic, industrial and agricultural irrigation purposes in the State of Maharashtra, a review and revision of wholesale water rates is issued vide Order No. The government has issued 5 orders to this effect.
The Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority, vide its order No. in the 1st
The water density method rates have been fixed for registered water use units, individual beneficiaries and private lift irrigation schemes. as well
As per the order No. 9 of the Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority, the entire supply of water for irrigation and water table assessment is proposed to be done by the density method.
(ha/ hr) and area wise densities have been prescribed.
However, during the transition period, considering the field situation, the duty on the project/ canal/ branch (ha/ hr) and the area where water is still available depending on the area
Consumption has not been transferred to the institution and it is not possible to measure water by volume method in places where water is being supplied to individual beneficiaries. as well as instead of
It will also not be appropriate to assess by the method of quantification according to the duty fallen (he/ she/ it). In this regard, various corporations, chief engineers related to irrigation management have expressed their problems to the government and have been discussed in many meetings.
As per the discussion and the field report, at present, many of the sanctioned posts in irrigation management are vacant and it is not possible to recruit new posts in future also to reduce the establishment cost. The government Pursuant to the Government Decision dated 17.11.2016
The Corporation is required to collect the consequential revenue as it has to meet the cost of maintenance/ repair of irrigation projects/ canals and certain establishment expenses from the water table revenue. Considering all these difficulties, it is not possible to supply water to individual farmers in the entire state through the solid state method. If there are no measuring instruments
Duty on project/ canal/ branch as specified in the order of the Authority
(ha/ hr) and area wise, the possibility of different rates for the same crop for each branch, canal and project can be ruled out

No. Because the geologic and geological conditions are different in the same project benefit area.
The actual water level may be different. Also, different water tables can be fixed for the same crop on different projects in the same zone.
The actual water consumption is indirectly measured in terms of density while calculating the tariff through duty method, which is not advisable. The measurement should be more transparent and
It's appropriate. Therefore, it is not advisable to levy on individual beneficiaries by indirect quantification by duty method. the area where water is still being used
There is no transfer, and in places where water is being supplied to individual beneficiaries, the tariff cannot be calculated using the density method.
Crops and fields are needed. used for agricultural purposes
The government was contemplating to revise the water tariff. A decision in this regard will be taken later.
Government's decision:
Both these density and area/ crop based water rates should be implemented as follows.
1. The area in which the Water Utilization Agency has been established in the project area. as well
Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority Order No. 1/2018 dated 11th January, 2018 as well as Corrigendum Order No. 1/ 2018 and Order No. 2/2018, the water used for agricultural irrigation purposes in the State of Maharashtra should be assessed as per the rate of density assessment method.
(2) For the period up to the establishment of a water use agency in the areas of the project benefit, where there is no water use agency yet, the rates of watersheds used for agricultural irrigation purposes in this Government decision, based on the above density rates, are based on the crop and area, for private sub-irrigation schemes and for irrigation.
The rates shall be determined in accordance with Annexures A and B respectively.
There is no change in the provisions of the order of the Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority regarding the rates and method of calculation for government sub-irrigation schemes. (Attached is the copy)
