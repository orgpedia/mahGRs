Letter No. Mua/ Jasamvikopra/ Kharbhumi/ Thane/ Song Firangipada/ Tan- 2/4226, dated 20/12/2017.
Introduction: Song- Firangipada Kharbhoomi Scheme, Taluka Bhiwandi, District Thane is included in the Kharbhoomi Scheme. The Union Forest Ministry has exempted the scheme under the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Act 1991. The total length of the project is 2980 m. The scheme is board time and was built in 1955 and renewed in 1992 under the European Economic Community (EEC) TPA II. At that time, the project was under construction. Due to incessant rains and high tides, the dam has been damaged to a great extent and the 2000-metre-high embankment has been damaged. Most of the project area has been affected due to the collapse of the embankment and the weakening of the embankment. This inflicted heavy loss on the farmers. This plan needs to be revised. The dam and embankment of the original plan are not in accordance with the new technical standards of the government. Therefore, it is necessary to update the scheme according to the new technical standards. As there was a strong written demand from the gram panchayat, beneficiaries and public representatives to take up this scheme immediately, the proposal to give administrative approval to the renovation work of the Firangipada Kharbhoomi scheme, which was received under the reference letter from the Chief Engineer, Water Resources Department, Konkan Region, Mumbai, was under the consideration of the government. Accordingly, the government has taken the following steps:
