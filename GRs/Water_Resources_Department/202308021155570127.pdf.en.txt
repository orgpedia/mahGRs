The Proposal:
A dam was built on the Mula River near Rahuri village in Rahuri taluka in 1974 and the water available in the rainy season is being supplied to irrigation through the right and left canals. Under this department, the work of irrigation management on the Mula Dawa canal and the Vitrika thereon is done. The original left canal was constructed in 1974 and major repairs have not been carried out since.
While irrigating through canals and distributaries, there is a large amount of leakage from the construction, which increases the transportation cost and disrupts irrigation management.
At present, the canal is being irrigated by the beneficiaries and the benefit area is being irrigated as per the Irrigation Act, 2005 by establishing 28 Small Water Utilization Societies. However, as the construction works on the main canal and the Vitarika are not repaired within several years, the Vitarika Level Water Utilization Agency and the Canal Level Water Utilization Agency are not ready to transfer. Therefore, according to the regional situation, the main construction on the Mula-Dawa canal should be repaired.
There is a need to repair the insulators, fix the lining and repair the filler wherever necessary. After the completion of this work, the remaining 1570 hectare area will be under irrigation.
