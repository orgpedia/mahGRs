Irrigation is going on. The construction of the irrigation capacity of the project has been completed by the end of June 2008. The project has been created
The irrigation potential is 24003 hectares and the projected available water storage is 169.69 DLH.
The left main canal of the Arunavati project is devoid of lining and there are a large number of trees in the canal
The trees have grown. Also, the canal is full of silt and water is stagnant. as well as canals and waterways
A lot of water is wasted here. As a result, irrigation in the tail-end areas of the canal is reduced.
Beneficiaries have to face the wrath as water is not going through the planned discharge to the last end.
It's costing. Due to waterlogging caused by heavy rain, crops in many areas have been damaged.
There is a danger of the farm land getting eroded/ leaking due to the overflowing of the canal and various constructions.
There is damage.
