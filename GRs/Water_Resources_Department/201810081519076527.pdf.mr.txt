Preamble: Integrated water management and market access is now considered as an important step to promote doubling farmers' income and more crop-per-drop schemes in the state.
While Water Resources Department is responsible for ‘off-farm’ activities, other departments, farmers and Water User Associations (established under the Maharashtra Management of Irrigation System by Farmers Act, 2005) contribute to the ‘on-farm' activities. These include adoption of micro-irrigation systems, improved cultivation practices, water conservation and choosing appropriate crops. Water use efficiency in Maharashtra is low and current adoption of micro irrigation systems is also less.
There are currently about 5000 WUAs in the state and their capacity to manage water supplied to them and also promote water use efficiency and productivity is weak, barring a few. Secondly, the required backward and forward linkages for inputs and marketing support for marketing their produce is also weak, with a few exceptions. The role of private sector is mainly limited to supplying inputs, equipment and buying their produce for further marketing and value addition.
Government of Maharashtra is addressing all these issues through schemes such as water conservation through Jalayukt Shivar, subsidies to farmers to adopt micro irrigation, Minimum Support Price for different crops, encouraging formation of Farmer Produce Companies (FPCs) for forward linkages, and recently resolved to encourage private sector to come up with innovating schemes through Swiss Challenge Method (vide GR dated 16th February, 2018). However, these are usually not addressed in an integrated manner, as they are managed by different departments.
GoM formed a Multi-Stakeholder Platform (vide GR dated 18th May, 2017), with technical assistance from 2030-Water Resources Group (2030-WRG), The World Bank, to support the state in bringing multi stakeholders togethers to address critical issues related to water use efficiency and productivity.

(CAWP) work stream established as a part of this initiative recommended setting up of a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) with a mandate to facilitate implementation of on farm and off-farm activities, also linked with the market uptake, in an integrated manner through coordination with various government departments and also through innovative Public-Private Partnership models. WRD's proposed PIU is supported by 2030 WRG as well.
Government Order:
1. Set-up a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) under the Water Resources Department to study, design and support integrated implementation of off-farm, on-farm investments, alongwith capacity building of the WUAs and also establishing appropriate financing and marketing linkages through PPP mode.

g) Project monitoring and evaluation,
h) Technology expert (ITC, weather advisory, GIS etc),
i) Capacity building expert.
(Officer's from Water Resources Department, Agriculture Department and Water Conservation Department will carry out the work of this unit while discharging their regular duties.)
1. PIU head shall report progress on monthly basis to Secretary (CAD) and Secretary (Agriculture).
2. In the initial period, the PIU is expected to study, identify pilot project areas, design appropriate PPP models and invite project proponents from private sector for demonstrating integrated implementation of off-farm, on-farm and market linkages for optimum water use efficiency and productivity results. The PIU shall review and
