The area is under irrigation. The canal works of this project were completed in 1999 and it was completed about 20 years ago. Because of the gap in the bedrock of the main canal, water does not reach the surface area. As the project is old and lacks regular maintenance and repair, the alignment of the canal has been damaged and many structures like aqueducts/ tube wells/ beams etc. have been damaged. Since the canal is contour-style, there is a hill on one side and a flood on the other side, and due to the absence of a zone section, a lot of water flows through this flood.
