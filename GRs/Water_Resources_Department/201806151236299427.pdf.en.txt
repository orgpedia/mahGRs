The Proposal:
With a view to improve the work done by the Mechanics Association and to ensure that maximum work is done through the available dapodi and various regional workshops of the Mechanics Association, Reference No. Under the Government Decision No. 3, it has been directed that it will be mandatory for the Mechanics' Association to carry out various works in the dapodi and various other regional workshops of the Mechanics' Association using the available tools, equipment, skilled/ unskilled workers under the department. It has also been mentioned that if a matter cannot be done using available machinery, manpower, etc., then there is no problem in submitting a detailed report to the government and doing the work through outsourcing with the prior permission of the government. In the last 5-6 years, there has been a change in the way work is done by the mechanical organization due to lack of necessary manpower and some work is being done by external agencies. Also, according to the government's policy, the Finance Department, Circular No. Notice No. 27/9/2010 In the 6th, it has been directed that instead of doing the work done by government employees for years in government offices, but which can be easily done from outside in the current changed situation, options should be adopted to do it through outsourcing. Also, the skilled manpower available with the Mechanical Department is decreasing due to retirement, so the matter of partial amendment in the Government Decision dated 28/10/2014 was under consideration of the Government.
GOVERNMENT DECISION: The competent authority under the Chief Engineer (Mechanical), while carrying out works through external agencies as per GOVERNMENT DECISION dated 28/10/2014, has decided to transfer the works to the Public Works Department, Government Decision No. 218/ Buildings-2, dated 16/12/2015, pursuant to the financial powers under Annexure 42 of Maharashtra Public Works Rules, 1984. As per Schedule 13 to the BAME Rules, Schedule 42 and Paragraph 135 of the S.B.V. Rules Book, technical approval of works should be done without fragmentation/ division of work.

(ii) Operation, maintenance and repair works to be carried out by external agencies shall be dealt with by the competent authority in accordance with paragraph 392 of serial number 57 of the Public Works Rules, Annexure 42. While these works are being carried out by external agencies, all tender works should be approved by the Chief Engineer (Mechanical), Water Resources Department, Nashik before inviting tenders. Also, in case of non-availability of grant/ funds for the work, no tender proceedings should be taken under any circumstances and the work liability should not exceed the sanctioned amount. Subject to the annual sanctioned subsidy for machinery, if the actual expenditure incurred for operation, maintenance and repair works exceeds the provision made in the hourly rate schedule of the Government approved machinery, the Government approval should be obtained for such works to be carried out by an external agency. Before calling for tenders, the concerned Superintending Engineer and Chief Engineer will have to give a certificate that the work cannot be done with the available plant and manpower of the Mechanical Department.
(3) The Chief Engineer (Mechanical) shall obtain the approval of the Executive Director concerned for the procurement of all works before the construction and erection of the irrigation schemes, their operation, maintenance and repair works, as well as the works of construction, erection, operation, maintenance and repair works by the Chief Engineer and the High Commissioner through an external agency.
In fact, all these works must be included in the receipt list approved by the Executive Director of the corporation for the relevant financial year. Such works should be completed by the Mechanics' Association through the tender process by first giving technical approval to the budget as per the Public Works Rules. These works will be considered as Deposit Works of the Corporation, according to which they should be accounted for.

The above instructions are for all types of work to be done by the Mechanics' Association and maximum work is to be done by the Mechanics' Association in the shops and various other regional workshops of the Mechanics' Association using the available tools, equipment, skilled/ unskilled manpower under the department.
