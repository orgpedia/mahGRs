The Proposal: -
Purmepada Minor Lake at Purmepada T.G. Dhule was completed in 1954 and the project is built near Purmepada village on the Bori River. The project is a mud dam and the length of the dam is 657 m. The maximum height is 25. 00 m. The watershed area of the project is 303.27 sq km. I.
The project area is 4850. The irrigated area is 1821.86.
Minor Irrigation Lake Purmepada T.G. Dhule Project has been completed in 1954. It has been 69 years since the construction was completed. The project has a main canal in two phases with Phase No. The length of the canal in Phase 1 is 8. 00 km and Phase No. The total length of the canal in 9 is 14.40 km with a length of 6. 40 km. Over the past few years, heavy rains have caused some construction collapses on the canal. As a result, a large amount of water has been lost, reducing the area under irrigation. Some of the other structures on the canal, such as the Nirvachak, Nirvachak water bridge, and Vinipat, have been destroyed near Jabal. This has made it very difficult to manage irrigation.
The project is planned to transfer the canal to the Farmers' Water Use Agency for water distribution, canal distribution, farm maintenance repair, irrigation management, and irrigation works. For this purpose, the beneficiary farmers have demanded the repair of the project. Repair works have been proposed for various chain numbers, bridges, siphons and some other constructions along the canal of Pooramepada Minor Lake. An estimated 1367 hectares of irrigated area is to be restored after the completion of this repair work.
Against this backdrop, the Pooramepada mini-project was launched. G. A proposal was under the consideration of the government to grant administrative approval under a special amendment to the budget for the repair work of various constructions on the Dhule inner canal. Accordingly, the government is taking the following decisions.
