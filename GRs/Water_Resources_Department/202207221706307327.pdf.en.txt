The Proposal:
The Beed project, completed in 1989, has a total water storage of 4.85 LHMC and irrigation potential of 690 hectares. The project has been transferred for irrigation management in 2009. Due to heavy rains in 2006 and 2008, the flood water was flowing through the drain at a high speed and the nearby fields were damaged. Therefore, the local farmers and people's representatives are demanding the construction of a protective wall on the Puch canal. The Waghebabhulgaon Medium Project is aimed at controlling the flow of water in the Puch canal during the rainy season to prevent possible damage to the dam and the adjacent farm. The proposal for administrative approval of the special renovation of the Punch canal of the project was under consideration of the government. The government has taken the following decisions:
