The Proposal: -
A big project. The Nandgaon District Nashik Sadar Project was completed in 1969 and transferred to irrigation management in 1970. The four main canals under the Girna project
It consists of the Panjan Dawa Canal, which starts near the village of Panjan on the left side of the mill project.
The length of the clawed left canal is 53.20 km and its projected carrying capacity is 7.093 cumecs. The canal passes through Malegaon, Dhule, Bhadgaon, and Chalisgaon in Nashik, Dhule, and Jalgaon districts.
These taluks benefit. A total of 12141 areas are irrigated by the Panjan Left Canal. As well as
The total length of Vitrika No. 7, which runs through the Panjan Left Canal, is 2.6 km.
The irrigated area is 205. Also the total length of distribution number 10 is 11.30 km and its total irrigated area is 1079. It has been 49 years since the construction of the project's distribution line was completed and during the irrigation period.
There are a lot of difficulties. Conceptual Carrying Capacity 250 on Panjan Left Main Canal
There are so many cusecs and the canal is flowing only 100 cusecs. In the irrigation cycle, five left canal fillings in Distribution No. 7 and No. 10 have been repaired and replaced with the old UC Lining which was done earlier.
There is a lot of leakage. Also, water is being wasted in large quantities due to erosion in the neighbourhood.
Crops are getting damaged due to waterlogging in the fields and the farm land is getting submerged due to continuous waterlogging. The earthen filler of distributaries 7 and 10 on Panjan Left Canal burst several times causing wastage of water.
It's gone.
It has been 49 years since the canal construction of the project was completed and the irrigation period is long.
There are problems galore. Conceptual carrying capacity of Panjan Left Main Canal 250 cusecs
At present, the canal is flowing at only 100 cusecs. The irrigation cycle consists of the filling of the main canal at the site and the old UCR lining made in the past as well as various constructions.
There is a drop in volume. A large amount of water from constructions, fillings while the canal is under water
Water is being wasted in large quantities due to leakage and erosion, causing waterlogging in neighbouring fields and crops.

Farmlands are getting submerged due to damage and continuous waterlogging. Panjon
Due to the left canal leakage, the canal's mud fill has been broken several times and water has been wasted.
The irrigation cycle period of the canal is increasing in the area of Chalisgaon and Bhadgaon.
The farmers do not have access to water during the irrigation period and the income of the farmers decreases.
They become depressed and face the wrath / grievances of the farmers. So
New lining at the filling point in Distribution No. 7 and 10 on Panjan Left Canal and
Siphon drain, water bridge repairs proposed, thereby restoring the carrying capacity of the canal
It will help. Also, the water from the canal stopped leaking to the nearby farmers.
There will be no loss to agriculture. There is also a possibility of the canal bursting during the current due to filling repairs.
will also be reduced.
Against this backdrop, the Panjhan left canal is the Panjhan left of the Panjhan left main canal canal.
