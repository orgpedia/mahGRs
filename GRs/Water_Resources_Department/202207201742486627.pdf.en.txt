Introduction: Mula Irrigation Project has two major canals namely Mula Right Bank Canal and Mula Left Bank Canal. The original right bank canal is 52 km long and was completed in 1972-73. The water carrying capacity envisaged since inception is 1650 cusecs. The water management of the entire benefit area of the Mula Dam project has been transferred to the Water Utilization Agency since 2006. All water use agencies are functional and water is being metered as per demand at government rates.
The construction of the canal has been completed for 50 years and the canal irrigates the area in all three seasons- kharif, rabi and summer. As per the field inspection conducted by the field officers, there has been a lot of damage to the alignment at various places in the right canal from Km 36 to 47, leakage and erosion from the canal, the canal cutting has been less than the planned cutting and hence the planned discharge has not been achieved, and the filling of the canal has been found to be in a dangerous condition at some places and the local people's representatives have also demanded to repair the canal. A proposal to grant administrative approval under special amendment to the budget for construction in MI was under consideration of the government. The government has taken the following decisions:
