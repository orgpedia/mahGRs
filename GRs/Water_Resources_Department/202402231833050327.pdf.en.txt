The dam has 21 pillars and 22 ghatas. The total number of gates is 198 and the size of the gates is 2. 00 X 0. 50.
The dam has a water storage of 0.28 L.H.M and an irrigation area of 72. That's so much. of this Co. P. Dam
Conceptual flood discharge 2753.97 Sweat / s. That's so much.
The dam is in bad shape due to lack of maintenance and repairs and the dam does not hold water.
The dam is expected to have all its gates installed after 15 October. Manar is a seasonal stream
Since it is a river, it does not flow very often after 15 October. As a result, there is no water in the dam.
Removing and returning the needles with manpower is a tedious task, with constant handling resulting in the needles being removed.
The leakage rate is increasing. It is proposed to install lifting mechanism mechanical doors as per the field conditions.
It has been done so that the doors can be lifted in a short time, leading to an untimely situation.
Flooding allows dam damage to be avoided, and results in more reliable water storage and irrigation.
The embankment is in masonry and has been washed away at some places due to lack of maintenance and repairs.
Coming up, this situation has led to the lifting of the barrage's earth instead of the small needles of the K.P. dam.
It is proposed to install mechanical doors.
