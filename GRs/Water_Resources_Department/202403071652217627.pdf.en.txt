It is the main canal. It consists of the Panjan Left Canal, a canal on the left side of the mill project.
It starts near the village. The length of the Panjan left canal is 53.20 km and its projected carrying capacity is 7.093 cumecs. The canal passes through Malegaon, Dhule, Nashik, Dhule, and Jalgaon districts.
The taluks of Bhadgaon and Chalisgaon benefit. Distributive No. 12 at the end of the left canal
It has a total length of 12.20 km and a total irrigated area of 1741. As well as Juardi Minor's
The total length of the project is 9. 00 km and its total irrigation area is 627.00 It has been 49 years since the construction of the project was completed and the irrigation period is very difficult.
The planned carrying capacity on the Panjan left main canal is 250 with the canal being only 100 cusecs.
It's moving. The irrigation cycle consists of filling repairs to the left channel at Distribution No. 12 and Juardie Minor and the old UC Lining and Siphon Drain, which were previously constructed at the site of the water bridge.
There is a drop in volume. Also, water is being wasted in large quantities due to erosion and water in neighbouring fields.
Crops are being damaged by logging and agricultural land is getting submerged due to continuous waterlogging.
The earthen fills of Vitrika No. 12 and Juardi Minor on the Panjan Left Canal burst several times, causing waterlogging.
It's gone.
It has been 49 years since the canal construction of the project was completed and the irrigation period is long.
There are problems galore. Conceptual carrying capacity of Panjan Left Main Canal 250 cusecs
At present, the canal is flowing at only 100 cusecs. The irrigation cycle consists of the old UCR Lining and Distribution No. 12 and the Juardie Minor at the site of these main canal fillings and earlier.
There is a large amount of leakage from various constructions in the area. When the water is running in the canal
Water is being wasted in large quantities due to massive water leakage and seepage from constructions, fillings, causing waterlogging in neighbouring fields, damaging crops and causing continuous waterlogging.

Because of this, the agricultural land is getting wet. Mud filling of the canal due to the leakage of the Panjan Left Canal.
At the same time, the water has been wasted by bursting. The irrigation cycle of the canal increases in duration.
As a result, water is available to the farmers of Chalisgaon and Bhadgaon areas during the irrigation period.
No, the income of the farmers decreases, leading to depression among them and the farmers.
Anger / complaint has to be faced. Hence, the division No. 12 and the juardi on the left canal of Panjon.
New lining and siphon drain, aqueduct repair proposed at filling site in Minor
This will help in restoring the carrying capacity of the canal. as well as from the canal
There will be no loss of agriculture to the nearby farmers by stopping the water leakage. Fill repair as well.
Due to this, the chances of canal erosion during the current are also going to be reduced.
Against this backdrop, the Panjhan Left Canal's Panjhan Left Main Canal's canal
