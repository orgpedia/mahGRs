Introduction: The Krishna Canal dates back to the British era, about 150 years ago. The length of the canal from 77/290 to 77/710 km. The section in m is 100% black soil and is passing through a soft deep cut trench. The average depth of this place is 5 meters. It further meets the 86 km Vasagadda dam built across the Yerla river. The Vasagadda dam is part of the Krishna canal, through which water is released into the Yerla river for irrigation. This water is used to irrigate 624 hectares of land in four villages of Mauje Vasgade, Nandre, Shirgaon and Bendri in the dam's benefit area. Due to the torrential rains for the last three years, the canal has completely collapsed, the water of the canal has stopped moving, and the farmers have stopped carrying out daily agricultural work and transporting sugarcane. The facility has been under repair for the past three years by the Mechanical Department. However, since the canal is in black soil, the barren land is eroding due to heavy rainfall every year. As such, this change is temporary. The cost of repairs is rising. For this, the canal in this length needs to be repaired and strengthened on a large scale.
