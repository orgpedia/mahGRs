A large volume of water mixed with soil on the downstream (D / S) side of the dam, starting from approximately 50 to 100 litres per second along the conduit, was threatened by the breach of the dam as a pothole had formed on the upstream (1 / 5) side of the dam near the main dam. Dam breaches were prevented by completing the dam leak repair and other temporary measures plan on a war footing to avoid risk to life and property of the dam STS. Detailed proposals have been received from the Regional Level Medi-Visual Drawing Association, Nashik in pursuance of the permanent repair of the ASAE Panderi Dam.
Farmers and local people's representatives dependent on the dam are demanding immediate repair of the dam as the water storage is not at full capacity at the present time due to the rupture of the stalagmite of the Panderi project. Accordingly, after the proposed amendment, the scheme will cover 255 villages in Ghosale, Panderi, Bahirbali, Kondgaon, Dandanagari. The area will benefit from irrigation.
