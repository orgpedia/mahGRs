Introduction: - The Bori Ambedkar Minor Irrigation Project is constructed on the Bori River near Tingri village in Malegaon taluka of Nashik district under Tapi basin. The mud dam work of the project was completed in the year 1992. The total water storage available in the dam is 3.54 LMT, useful water storage is 2.82 LMT and irrigation area is 990. The villages in Malegaon taluka include Jhodge, Astane, Jalku, Vanpat, Lakhane, and Rajmane. The right channel of the project is 11 km and the zodiacal distribution is 7 km.

As a result, it has adversely affected irrigation, averaging 77 in the last five years, despite giving only 2% in the rabi season. Flow irrigation has been done.
The right canal of the Bori Ambedkar Project is 0.00 km to 0.00 km. Distributed by M. 19B. A closed channel system has been proposed to restore the deprived irrigation area in the tail area of the canal carrying capacity improvement project by reducing the rotation period by preventing water leakage from 0.00 km to 7.00 km. 661 after completion of the project. The irrigation area is going to be restored. The maximum irrigated area under the project in the last five years is 249 hectares with a total irrigation potential deficit of 6,691 hectares. After the completion of the distribution system through this closed channel, 661 hectares of irrigation area is to be restored. Earlier, D.
