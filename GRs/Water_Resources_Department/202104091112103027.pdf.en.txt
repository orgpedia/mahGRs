Preamble: The Department of Water Resources has issued consolidated revised tender instructions under the Government Resolution No. 1. Reference No. 2 and 3 have been issued. Also Reference No. 4 under paragraphs 1 to 3 of the above Government Decision. 14,18,19 and paragraph 24, point no. The revised guidelines have been issued by superseding the guidelines given under 24.3.
At present, due to the tendering process through e-tendering and the rapid ability to disseminate information to the far-flung contacts due to information technology, it is possible to disseminate information faster than the news broadcast in the print newspaper. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the time of newspaper tender publication to speed up the tender process. Accordingly, the government was contemplating to issue a notification in this regard.
Also, the tenderer is expected to complete the project work within the available resources by inspecting the workspace. This will allow to control the additional liability of the project. Accordingly, there should be a clear standard operating procedure (SOP) while revising the tender process for effective implementation of the tenderer's inspection of the area and taking responsibility for it. So that no contractor will get a chance to complain. Following is the release of the report:
Government Referendum A) Reference No. In the Government Resolution No. 1. Table 7 should read as follows:
