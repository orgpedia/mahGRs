Mulap/ Administration/ 1380/ S.D. 27/11/2019.
The Proposal:
The Maharashtra Government's policy is to provide all government services to the general public at affordable prices through information technology in an effective, transparent and fast manner. Through the various projects of the Water Resources Department, the farmers of the state get irrigation facilities, drinking water to the people, water for industrial use to the factories, etc. There is a need to use modern technology through e-governance in the irrigation management works of the project to provide various services easily and effectively.
The irrigation management has been transferred to the corporations and the establishment cost of irrigation management is proposed to be reimbursed by the corporations from the amount of the watershed. Accordingly, there is a need to drastically reduce the installation cost and increase the water table recovery so that more funds can be available for maintenance and repair of the projects.
Accordingly, the 12th Project Implementation Committee has accorded administrative approval for implementation of computerized system for facilitating irrigation management work on the projects of Water Resources Department through e-Governance Board. The computerized system consists of Primary Irrigation Plan (PIP) and CIP, Water Supply Schedule, Irrigation and Non-Irrigation Payments Payment Gateway and Irrigation Status Monitoring Report, Water Accounts and Static Marking Report etc.
Once the project impact area is calculated through this system, the assessment charts and payments will be prepared season-wise through this system. Once the master data base of the project is created, the computation and formatting charts will be done using this system in each season implemented every year. After clearing the system, payments will be generated and disbursed. Various online services are proposed for farmers and non-irrigation consumers through this system. It will provide information about watermen, payment gateways and grievance redressal facilities. Based on the information in this system, it will be easier for the Water Resources Department to prepare irrigation status reports, water records and static marking reports, which will further facilitate better control over the irrigation management system.

For this system, the e-Governance Board will need various data bases from the field offices. It is necessary to collect information such as revenue documents, village accounts, benefit area maps, etc.
With the use of modern technology (aerial survey, Geographic Information System (GIS), Information and Technology (ICT), web and mobile application etc.), the crop-wise data of the entire area irrigated on irrigation projects will be obtained in a very short time and the details of the survey can be saved, making it easier to resolve any complaint in the future. Considering these advantages, and considering the inadequate number of personnel employed for irrigation management at present, it would be advisable to carry out surveys for all the projects through modern technology.
The e-Governance Board intends to use modern technology for collection of this information to bring uniformity, uniformity and consistency in the irrigation management domain across the State. This information is required to be collected by the field offices before the system under development and operationalization by the e-Governance Board.
In this background, the office of the Chief Engineer (JE), Pune, carried out the work of measuring the irrigated area through aerial survey on a pilot basis using new technology. The actual irrigated area of the projects so counted showed a substantial increase over the earlier ones. With the help of drone technology, it is possible to identify the formation accurately and save its permanent record in the form of a photograph. Keeping in view the encouraging results of this experiment and the difficulties encountered during this survey, the limitations of aerial surveys, the government was considering to decide on a strategy to develop various mobile applications, computer systems, etc. on the basis of the methodology and available data base to use new technologies for counting and assessment on the basis of the experience of the irrigated area. Accordingly, the following decisions are taken:
Government Decisions: The methodology for the management of irrigation is prescribed as follows: Initial Irrigation Programme, Water Supply Schedule, Actual Irrigation Area Calculation, Complete Irrigation Programme, Irrigation and Non-Irrigation Payments, Payment Gateway, Irrigation Status Monitoring Report, Management of assets of Water Resources Department, and use of new technology for Irrigation Area Calculation and Assessment.
(1) Initial Irrigation Programme (P.I.P.)
By planning the use of irrigation and non-irrigated water available in each dam on October 15 of each year, in the Rabi and summer seasons.

GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: SANKIRNA-2019/ (P.S. 358/2019)/ S.V. (Works)
The work of determining the total amount of water available to the farmers and the canal rotation is being done through the Primary Irrigation Plan. The prescribed template for this work should be made available in the form of an excel sheet and the programme/ plan should be prepared. In the future, it should be planned to bring uniformity in the work by preparing a program/ plan of all the projects through computer system. With this the total irrigation program of the state can be controlled by preparing it.
(2) the canal rotation schedule.
A canal wise watershed schedule is prepared to implement the number and duration of irrigation watersheds determined by the initial irrigation plan. Through this, farmers will be able to know which canal, how many times (No. Time), how long and how much water will be available. At present, this schedule is prepared and implemented by publishing it through a public issue in newspapers. However, considering the difficulties faced during the actual implementation, a mobile app should be developed for strict implementation of the water supply schedule, through which all the officers/ staff associated with irrigation management should get the real-time status of the discharge from the canal, canal-wise/ branch canal-wise/ distribution-wise, the current status of the flow through visual representation on the map of the distribution system. Analyze the data and make decisions based on it.
3) Calculation of direct irrigated area:
Every season, the actual irrigated area under the project is calculated by the staff in the category of canal surveyors, canal supervisors, department clerks in the branch offices under irrigation management. At present, the total irrigation potential created by the under construction and completed projects under the Water Resources Department is estimated at 52.30 lakh hectares, with normal direct irrigation ranging from 35.00 lakh hectares to 40.00 lakh hectares.
Modern technology should be adopted in the work of collecting and compiling the season-wise data of the actual irrigated area.
In this regard, the information on e-Jal Seva and Jal Shruthi App should be collated and linked to ensure the benefit area of each project through modern technology, verify the soaking area other than the project benefit area, ensure the source of irrigation water supply to the soaking area (well/ drain canal etc.), determine the difference between the declared irrigation area and the actual soaking area and find out the reasons, determine the extent of Gross Benefit Area (GCA) and Cultivable Benefit Area (CCA). To that end, the benefit area of all irrigation projects should be calculated using modern technology in the form of data.

vi) The main objective of the survey should be to ensure that the benefit area of large and medium projects in the first phase and small projects in the second phase is ensured through state-of-the-art technology and its utilization for other aspects related to irrigation management.
vii) The exact area of benefit to be assessed for each project will be determined after the calculation with the help of state-of-the-art technology. Accordingly, the Form No. 12 and 13) and payments should be made.
(vii) Specifications and deliverables of the survey and the procedure and other instructions prescribed for its conduct shall be issued separately at the level of the Government.
Completion of Irrigation Programme (CIP):
The actual implementation of the canal watershed depends on the capacity of the distribution system to carry the envisaged discharge, the status of various constructions on the canal. Based on this, the initial irrigation program should be prepared. After the implementation of the initial irrigation program, a complete irrigation program should be prepared as per the actual irrigation program. The computer system for preparing the complete irrigation program on the lines of the initial irrigation program should be developed by the e-governance board on the basis of the experience of every year and by solving the errors/ problems.
Irrigation and non-irrigation payments:
Irrigation and non-irrigation payments should be generated from the computer system module developed under e-Water Service System. Information on the use of basic water for irrigation payments

Since it is based on accuracy, the actual irrigated area should be calculated using state-of-the-art technology. Where there is a density measurement system, it should be done based on the density measurement by measuring it with sensors. Sophisticated meters should be installed for non-irrigation so that meter readings can be given through tele-messaging. A separate computer system for this should be developed by the e-governance board.
The Payment Gateway:
Provision should be made to the farmers and non-irrigated water users by creating a separate payment gateway for the recovery of irrigation water table, non-irrigated water table payments related to irrigation management and providing the facility to pay the amount of online water table directly to the Water Resources Department. The computer system/ mobile app for this will be developed by the e-Governance Board.
(a) Publications:
State-of-the-art technology should be used to enhance the accuracy and reliability of the data for various reports published by the Water Resources Department every year (Irrigation Status Review Report (ISR), Water Accounts Report (WAR), Static Marking Report (BMR), etc.
8) Asset Management (Asset Management)
The land, buildings, etc. of the Water Resources Department should be registered and monitored using modern techniques in accordance with the property and especially the encroachments near dams and canals, colonies, submerged areas. This modern technology should be used for asset management and protection.
(a) The control:
The development, planning and control of all the above computerization work related to irrigation management will be done under the Superintending Engineer, e-Governance Board, Pune. The Superintending Engineer, E-Governance Board, Pune, with the approval of the Chief Engineer, Chief Auditor of Accounts, Water and Irrigation, Aurangabad, should take all necessary actions for aerial survey, computer system development, e-work using all such computer systems and modern technology.
