The project is proposed to be built on the Krishna river in the general area of Satara under the Maharashtra Krishna Valley Development Corporation. The dam site has a maintenance embankment built about 150 years ago and is fed by the 86 km long Krishna Canal from the left bank of the dam at a height of 11,294 ft. The area is receiving irrigation water. Since this earlier dam was completely filled with silt, a 35 m.ft. of silt was deposited on the downstream side (D/ S) adjacent to this dam. A new entrance is proposed. The total length of the dam is 249 metres. It has 12 meters. There are 17 tracks in total. It is 12 x 5 meters. There are 17 doors.
Under the project, it is proposed to construct only a gate-cum-maintenance embankment from which 11,294 drains under the Krishna canal. The irrigation sector requires 5.7-AHF of water, which will be available from the free catchment area of the Khodashi dam and the regeneration flow from the existing Dhom and Kanher project upstream.
The government had allocated Rs. 1978 crore for the scheme. The original administrative approval was granted at a cost of Rs. 2.23 crore (Tariff 1977-78).
However, the project cost increased due to change in tariff schedule during construction, acceptance of higher rate tender, increase in cost of land acquisition, provisioning as per detailed concept, other reasons and incidental costs. Therefore, the Maharashtra Krishna Valley Development Corporation had first submitted the revised administrative sanction proposal to the government for approval.
Report on the project The meeting of the Expenditure Priority Committee held on 15/2/2018 discussed the Expenditure Priority Committee discussed the current status of construction, the reasons for the price increase, the remaining work in the project, 11,294 on the Krishna canal originating from the dam. With a view to complete the construction of the new gated tank to keep the area intact, it has been consciously decided to accord administrative approval to the first revised project report of Rs. 27.94 crore based on the 2013-14 tariff of Water Resources Department and 2015-16 tariff of PWD.
