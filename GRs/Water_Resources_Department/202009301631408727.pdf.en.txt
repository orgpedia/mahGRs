The Proposal:
" Guidelines regarding the concept of Upasana Irrigation Scheme and preparation of scheme plans" Reference No. 1 of the above Government Resolution No. 5 guidelines have been issued regarding the concept of Upasana Irrigation Scheme. Accordingly, it is directed that the envisaged discharge for the approved benefit area of all types of lift irrigation schemes shall be taken as 70% of the maximum fortnightly water demand based discharge as per revised Penman method (12 days carrying period and two days off). This instruction is mainly the main topic, for example. The distribution system applicable for the work is the direct I.D. system at the respective distributors/ small distributors etc. Irrigation for C.A. is planned according to the schedule.
The Government has issued Irrigation Policy No. The above decision has been taken by the government. Further, Guidelines on Piped Distribution System Policy Reference No. The above Government Circulars have been issued. In this regard, Section No. 6.0 directs that" the distribution system should be conceptualized taking into account the maximum water requirement in a fortnight as per the project cropping pattern."
Also Reference No. 4 and 5, the instructions for the determination of the capacity of the pump house to discharge 70% of the peak discharge should be applied to the closed tube distribution system as it relates to the use of the traditional distribution system below the distribution well, or

How is that questionable. In order to remove this ambiguity, it was under the consideration of the Government to issue consolidated guidelines for sub-tillage irrigation schemes having conventional distribution system as well as tubewell distribution system.
Government Decision: Reference No. Government Circulars No. 4 and 5. 1 of the Government Resolution No. The revised guidelines are as follows: 5.0
The following guidelines should be strictly followed to ensure that the irrigation scheme is technically cost effective, socially acceptable and environmentally sustainable and to bring about uniformity in planning and concept.
(c) The discharge envisaged for the pump house of sub-irrigation schemes having open channel distribution system of 12 days carrying period and 2 days closure shall be taken as 70% of the maximum 14 days water demand based discharge as per revised Penman method.
(b) Conceptual discharge for pump house of sub-irrigation schemes having captive tubewell distribution system of 12 days carrying period and 2 days closure shall be taken as 85% of the maximum 14 days water demand based discharge as per revised Penman method.
(c) The discharge envisaged for the pump house of irrigation schemes having a full cycle of 14 days carrying period and captive tube well distribution system shall be as per the revised Penman method based on the maximum water demand of 14 days.
(d) In a closed tubewell irrigation scheme, the discharge capacity of the distribution system should be commensurate with the discharge capacity of the pump house.
(f) The modern period should be 14 days and 24 hours of pumping.
g) No additional pump should be provided.
(h) The general plans of all the planned irrigation schemes should be approved at the competent level only after examination by the Central Conceptual Organisation in terms of technical feasibility.
