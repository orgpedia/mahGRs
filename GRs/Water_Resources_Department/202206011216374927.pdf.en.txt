The Gangapur project, completed in 1964, has two canals, the Nashik Left Bank Canal and the Nashik Right Bank Canal. The right bank canal of Nashik has been closed due to urbanization. The total length of the Nashik Left Bank Canal is 51.540 m. The carrying capacity of the canal is 315 cusecs. The total irrigated area (ICA) of the canal is 12190 hectares. A total of 4 irrigation branches are working on the canal- Nashik, Pimpri Syed, Kherwadi and Kasbe Sukene respectively.
As the mud work of the Nashik Left Bank Canal and the constructions on it are about 60 years old, the canal is not flowing at full capacity and the water is being lost on a large scale due to the leakage of water from the constructions and the flood.
The construction and soil work on the canal needs to be strengthened/ repaired to reduce the frequency and load.
The government was considering giving administrative approval to the work of the left bank canal of the Gangapur project under a special amendment as it would be possible to irrigate the project area by achieving the envisaged discharge by reducing the rotation period if repairs were made. Accordingly, the government has taken the following steps:
Government Decision: The Government has taken a decision to construct a 24/520 km long left bank canal of the Gangapur project under the Godavari Marathwada Irrigation Development Corporation. It is 330 m. Drainage and distribution
