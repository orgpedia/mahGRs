However, as it was not possible to work within the given time frame for preparing detailed budgets for the proposed parameters as per the model budget, preparing the said budgets and submitting them to the Department of Agriculture, Department of Soil and Water Conservation and Employment Guarantee Scheme Department for feedback, and to hold a meeting of the re-study group after determining the parameters for the elimination of saline areas as soon as the feedback is received from all the concerned departments, the study group was given an extension of 6 months from the date of 25.08.2022 under the Government Sanction Letter dated 14.12.2022. However, the matter of extending the study group further is under the consideration of the government as it will take some time to study the report received from the Department of Agriculture, Department of Soil and Water Conservation and Department of Employment Guarantee Scheme.
