Introduction: At present, under the e-Water Service Module M19, the work of making payments for Binger Irrigation customers in the state is being done. The system provides data of about 7500 Binger Irrigation customers but it is being used for payment of 2000 Binger Irrigation customers. In exercise of the powers conferred by sections 11 (w) and 11 (d) of the Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority Act, 2005, the Authority has revised and revised the wholesale water rates by prescribing criteria for agricultural, irrigation, industrial, domestic purposes in the State. Out of these three categories, the revised norms and water tariff for industrial and domestic users are not possible to be included in the existing M-19 e-Water Service System. Also, the water tariff and penal provisions issued by the Authority and the criteria in Module M19 are different. The revised rates for non-irrigated watersheds are effective from 1st February, 2018 and are complicated by the fact that the current water year (November, 2017 to October, 2018) and the new water year (July, 2018 to June, 2019) fall between February, 2018 to June, 2018. Also, considering the need to implement changes in policy matters other than Jaladara and the time it would take, the government was considering the development of a new computer system to ensure uniformity while preparing payments for non-irrigation water use.
