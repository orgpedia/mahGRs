The Proposal:
It is a small project. Kalamb is located on a local stream near Antargaon village in Yavatmal district. The project site is located at Longitude 20 17 30 Latitude 78 2500 on the map. The project was completed in 1986. The actual irrigation was started in 1987-88 and the project was transferred to Irrigation Management in 1990. The length of the dam is 1078 m. The length of the sewer is 79 m. The total water storage is 7.20 Dalghami and the useful water storage is 6.28 Dalghami. The project has two main canals, left and right, with a length of 15.18 km and 6.0 km respectively. The total length of the tunnel is 19.45 km. Their discharge capacities are 0.866 h/ s and 0.257 h/ s respectively. The canal's distribution system is in the soil and in some areas the canal has passed through the floodplain. As a result, the river continues to flow in the area. The construction of the canal distribution system has been disrupted for 32 years. Because the canal is made of black soil, silt accumulates and the canal bursts from the floodplain. For irrigation irrigation irrigation is done by doing some amount of dyeing. Due to lack of drainage water is not able to reach the tail end. As a result, farmers of Antargaon, Dongarkharda, Sarati, Musal, Paloti, Nagthan, Metikheda and Kinhala are deprived of irrigation every year. The local people's representatives, the water utility and the farmers of the area had demanded this work from time to time. In this regard, Government Resolution No. The proposal to grant administrative approval under the special amendment for this work in the exercise of the authority granted to the department under the Government Decision No. 2 and 3 was under consideration of the Government.
