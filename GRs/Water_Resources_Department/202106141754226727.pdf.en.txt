Government's decision:
Out of this, 115.68 DLH has been reserved for non-irrigation purposes. Thus, the irrigation potential is reduced from 6056 hectares to 2370 hectares. However, the beneficiaries have been demanding to wet 4268 hectares of area spread over the length of the completed canal at Vashirki, Koproli, Vashi. To keep this advantage intact, it is possible to meet the demand by using tube distribution system and micro irrigation technology. Accordingly, the revised water plan is being approved as follows.
