GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: PRAMA-2013/ (PR No. 785/13)/ SINVYA (Works)
Ministry, Mumbai 400032,
Date: 01/08/2019
Reference:- 1) Government Decision No. 2013/ (785/13/ CENVIA (Works), dated 01/01/2015.
Government Resolution No. Devadu 2015/ (836/15)/ Simvya (Works), dated 17.11.2016.
3) Government Resolution No. 2016/ (27/2016)/ LPA-2, dated 26.05.2017.
Government Resolution No. 2017/ (566/17)/ Simvya (Works), dated 31.08.2018.
Government Resolution No. 2017/ (551/17)/ SINVYA (Works), dated 27.11.2018.
The Proposal:
The completed projects of the Water Resources Department are transferred to the Irrigation Management Department. Thereafter, regular maintenance and repair works of the projects are carried out from the water table received by the Corporation. The works under Special Repair and Extension Reforms are taken up from the funds under the schemes. Such works are funded by the government under the head of accounts under the plan. In order to streamline the proposal of works to be covered under special amendments, extensions and modifications, considering the number of projects, age group and available funds in the given circumstances and to remove the current bottlenecks in the presentation of proposals, a comprehensive guideline has been issued in the aforesaid Reference No. 1 was issued.
After that, the regional offices were facing difficulties in implementing these guidelines. During the special repair/ extension/ improvement works of completed irrigation projects, the actual work time is reduced as the canal is in spate and the water is stored in the dam.
So, although the work planning is for 2 years, it actually takes 4 to 5 years. Therefore, it is necessary to increase the duration of the workplan of special repairs.
Reference No. Under the Government decision mentioned in section 2, the Department of Water Resources has approved the transfer of irrigation management to irrigation corporations and the expenditure of all matters related to irrigation management from irrigation and non-irrigation watershed recovery. Under this, necessary work is done at the corporation level in terms of regular maintenance and repair of irrigation projects completed with the funds available from the water table recovery and to resolve the errors of category 3 type from the annual dam status report of the Dam Safety Organization, Nashik.

GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: PRAMA-2013/ (PR No. 785/13)/ SINVYA (Works)
Reference No. Power to grant administrative approval for special amendment works under Section 3 of the Rs. 5 crore has been provided to the Water Resources Department. Administrative sanction of extension improvement works to the tune of Rs. 5 crore has been provided to the Water Resources Department with the concurrence of the Planning Department.
After the above reference no. The Department of Water Resources, mentioned in section 5, gave the government decision. Under 27/11/2018, it has been decided to spend up to a limit of 10% of the total annual outlay on works under Special Repair and Extension and Improvement.
In the last 50-55 years, new dams have been built to create water storage and irrigation potential. At present, the work on the dams is in progress in terms of planning of available water and utilization of water as determined by various tribunals.
Since the projects under construction have been taken up in proportion to the State's share of water and it is not possible to take up new dams in the future, the important task will be to maintain the completed dams, canals and distribution systems and to manage the resources created.
After the formation of the state, there has been no provision of funds on a large scale to protect the resources created and to keep them in good condition for operation. As a result, there are huge problems at the field level in irrigation management and many repair works have been stalled due to lack of funds.
The Executive Summary in Volume 1 of the State's Integrated State Water Plan states that it is imperative to provide adequate funds for regular maintenance and repair and for special repairs, extensions and improvements to avoid complete loss of project components and to keep the irrigation system efficient. It is also stated that delayed maintenance/ maintenance and repair will lead to permanent inefficiency of the project components in the future and will be responsible for the loss of irrigation facilities to the farmers, resulting in huge expenditure for restoration.
Also, Volume 1, Executive Summary, Issue No. 8 in the main recommendation point no. 8.3 Project Planning and Irrigation Management Issue No. The Economic Life of many of the pre-independence structures has ended and therefore, special financial provisions are required to be made in addition to the prevailing capital expenditure for the repair of large number of dams/ structures.
Letter to Governor As on 14.08.2009, the Department of Water Resources in consultation with the Planning Department is required to frame a policy for special repairs and extensions and improvements.
Accordingly, the Planning Department has given its views on the formulation of policy on many cases/ clauses submitted to the Planning Department and the Finance Department has also contacted the Planning Department in this regard.
