The proposal-
Under Section 3 of the Act, the Buldhana Irrigation Project Board, Buldhana, working under Minor Irrigation Department No. 2, Chikhli has been shifted to Shegaon HQ for Jigaon project rehabilitation work. The land acquisition and rehabilitation work of the Jigaon mega project is mainly in Nandura and Jalgaon-Jamod taluks.
It is more convenient to have the headquarters of the office in Khamgaon instead of Shegaon. Accordingly, on the recommendation of the Vidarbha Irrigation Development Corporation, Nagpur, the matter of shifting the headquarters of the Zigaon Project Rehabilitation Department, Shegaon Divisional Office from Shegaon to Khamgaon was under consideration. Accordingly, the following decisions are taken:
Government's decision
It is hereby approved to shift the headquarters of the Divisional Office of Jigaon Project Rehabilitation Division, Shegaon, functioning under the Divisional Office of the Superintending Engineer, Buldhana Irrigation Project Board, Buldhana, to Khamgaon for administrative convenience and control over the project works.

The Divisional Office of the Executive Engineer, Jigaon Project Rehabilitation Division, Shegaon (Construction) shall be made functional with the existing original charge and sanctioned establishment of the Headquarters at Khamgaon in the name of the Executive Engineer, Jigaon Project Rehabilitation Division, Khamgaon (Construction), due to the shifting of the headquarters.
