There are a total of 3452 projects comprising 86 major, 258 medium and 3108 minor irrigation potentials in the State as on end of June 2015. In the rainy season, water from the rivers, rivulets and brooks overflow into the lake. Along with this flood water, many materials like soil, stones, gravel, sand are washed away and gradually the storage capacity of the dam decreases. With the age of the dam, the decline in water storage is increasing and this decline is seen in many dams. The reduction in storage capacity of the dam has an adverse impact on irrigation potential and power generation. Agriculture, drinking water, industrial development and rural development are the mainstays of the state's economy. Water is essential for agriculture, industry, and energy. As well as the growing population
The demand for water will increase in all areas. Considering the challenges of water in the future, its systematic management will be a big challenge. Various measures will have to be taken in the future to increase the water storage capacity.
As part of this, it has become necessary to determine the policy on the removal of silt and mixed sand/ sand accumulated in major, medium and minor irrigation projects in the state. In this regard, the Department of Revenue and Forest has issued a policy in accordance with the government decision dated September 9, 2014.
All irrigation projects in the state are under the Water Resources Department. Section 18 of the Irrigation Development Corporations Act
Accordingly, the Irrigation Corporations are expected to plan, construct and manage irrigation, flood control and benefit area development of the projects under their jurisdiction.
