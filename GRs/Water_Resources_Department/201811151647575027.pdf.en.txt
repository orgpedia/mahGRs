Read:- 1) Planning Department No.DAP-2016/ Q.No. 175/1481-A, Dy. 30.06.2017 and D. Letters dated 11.07.2017.
(2) Government Decision No. 187/2017/ LPA-1, D. 23.08.2017
Introduction: Under the Water Resources Department, district level works under the River Linking Scheme in Jalgaon/ Dhule/ Nandurbar/ Sangli etc. districts have been done with administrative approval from the District Planning Board and funds have been made available. The Planning Department had informed that since the' River Interlinking Scheme' implemented in 2005 is to be implemented in the entire state, the policy decision needs to be taken by the Water Resources Department as an administrative department with the necessary level of approval and accordingly a Government decision has been issued in this regard. " However, the District Collector, Aurangabad, said. As per the letter dated 18.04.2018, the Department of Water Resources has issued a notification regarding the interlinking of rivers in the district. It is observed that the background mentioned in the Government Resolution dated 23.08.2017 is related to Jalgaon district and the Government Resolution is limited to Jalgaon district. However, the No. 2 Although the background mentioned in the Government decision seems to be closely related to Jalgaon district, the detailed policy is all inclusive and is being implemented in all the districts of the state.
Government Decision: In accordance with the above letter of the Planning Department, the policy of including the District Level River Linking Plan in the District Annual Plan is being ensured through this decision by overruling the government decision in context.
The water resources department officials' solution to the scarcity-like situation has proved to be very beneficial in the past. For such Intra-Sub Basin River/ Tributary Link Projects, if the availability of additional water is made available after a thorough study of the water availability in coordination with the concerned District Collector and the officials of the Water Resources Department, such river link projects can be successfully implemented. Centrally Sponsored National River Linking Schemes have a larger scope and higher cost. However, making drinking water available at the district level, connecting deficient or highly deficient basins/ sub basins with the basins/ sub basins of abundant availability through small connections is considered necessary for immediate benefit. The government has issued orders towards this. The District Planning Board has also implemented these schemes in some places. However, there is no clear policy in this regard.

There have been problems. In this regard, the following policy is being decided to be implemented by the District Planning Board.
1) Water should not be diverted from deficit or excess deficit basins/ sub basins while planning river interlinking schemes.
(2) Diversion of water from a river/ rivulet/ canal flowing through a catchment area where surplus water is available to a river/ rivulet/ canal/ reservoir in a deficit/ excess deficit catchment area may be included. This will include water augmentation by filling up reservoirs in deficit basins, thereby increasing the availability of potable water, restoration of irrigated areas, recharging of canals through conveyances, etc. For this, the water availability certificate will have to be obtained from the Chief Engineer, Water Science Project, Nashik.
3) The area affected by the diversion of water through the scheme should be taken into account for calculating the benefit ratio. The profitability ratio of the scheme should be at least 1.50.
4) The District Collector has issued the Planning Department Government Decision No. GVO/ 1007/ PR No. 39/ K-144, D. Action to be taken as per instructions dated 16.02.2008.
5) For the funds available under this scheme, the Planning Department Government Decision No. GVO/ 1008/ PR No. 41/ KA-1444, Dy. A separate subtitle was released on August 13, 2008. Under this head of accounts, the collector should provide funds for incomplete works.
(6) The said scheme shall be implemented by the system under the control of the Water Resources Department, i.e., the river from which the water is being diverted to the dam/ storage tank, and by the system in whose possession it is to be operated, or by such system as the Collector may prescribe.
7) The quality control of the work of the schemes should be done through the quality control mechanism under the Water Resources Department. Complaints should also be dealt with by the concerned vigilance and quality control team. Also, the work of the scheme should be verified by the district collector or a third party agency appointed by the government.
After the completion of the scheme, such schemes should be transferred to the concerned Irrigation Department, which looks after the irrigation management under the Water Resources Department.
9) The link canal should not be desalinated as the beneficiaries of the scheme are also expected to benefit from the recharge.
10) If the funds required for the acquisition of lands for the river linking scheme are not provided in the original administrative approved budget, then a revised budget for such works should be prepared and provision should be made in it as per the new Land Acquisition Act.
While preparing the budget for new works, provision should be made as per the new Land Acquisition Act.
