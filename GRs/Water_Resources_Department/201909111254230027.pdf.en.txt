GOVERNMENT DECISION NO. 2018/ (P.S. 287/18)/ MEDIUM PROJECT GOVERNMENT DECISION: Deharjee Medium Project is being approved for the drinking water of Vasai Virar City Municipal Corporation from the financial sources of Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority instead of being implemented by Konkan Irrigation Development Corporation from their financial sources subject to the following conditions.
The Water Resources Department should confirm whether the 69.42 Dalghami water quantity reserved for Vasai Virar City Municipal Corporation from Deharji Medium Project is suitable as per the criteria of domestic and industrial water allocation published by Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority on 22/09/2017. As per these norms, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) should take action to provide the required quantity of water to the Vasai Virar City Municipal Corporation from a source that is technically feasible and economically viable.
2) The entire amount deposited by the Vasai Virar City Municipal Corporation with the Konkan Irrigation Development Corporation for the Deharji Medium Project should be adjusted by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority at the time of entering into a water availability agreement with the Vasai Virar City Municipal Corporation.
3) The entire cost of the project should be transferred by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority through Konkan Irrigation Development Corporation, Thane, instead of Vasai Virar City Municipal Corporation as capital contribution. Since the Urban Development Department does not have the necessary mechanism, the Water Resources Department should take action to give revised administrative approval to the project.
4) Since the project is proposed by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority with capital contribution, it will be mandatory to pay ownership fee as per the government circular issued from time to time by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority for the use of reserved water. The project will be managed and maintained by the Water Resources Department, while the cost of management and maintenance will be borne by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA).
It should be ensured that the financial burden of the project, any financial liability and other responsibilities arising in the future will be of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority and there will be no additional burden on the government.
The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) is required to make arrangements for lifting and distribution of water at their own cost.
7) The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) cannot guarantee reserve water if there is a shortage of water at the point of origin.
8) The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority should install a treatment system on the waste water generated. The details of the action taken in this regard should be given to the Konkan Irrigation Development Corporation, Thane and the Environment Department from time to time.
