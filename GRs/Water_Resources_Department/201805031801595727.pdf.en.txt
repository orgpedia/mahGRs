Preamble: Irrigation Department Government Circular No. FDW 1089/243/89/ SINVYA (Works) D. 2.9.1989 and d. Under 21.9.1989, instructions have been issued to design floodplains so that no construction takes place within the floodplains to avoid the potential risk of flooding.
Construction of bridges over the river for the development of towns, villages and pilgrimage areas in the prohibited area of the river within the blue flood line and in the controlled area between the red flood line and the blue flood line, construction of approach roads on both sides of the bridge, construction of roads, parks and jogging tracks along the river as per the city development plan, construction of flood protection wall along the river bank under flood protection works, construction of ghats and gas pipeline crossings, crossing of electricity lines, laying of drainage pipelines along the river, construction of sewerage projects, etc.
Government Circular No. 424/2014 SINVYA (M), DI. Under 2.3.2015, floodplain and floodplain maps and plans are approved by the Water Resources Department. However, the Irrigation Department vide Government Circular No. FDW 1089/243/89/ Simvya (Works), Dy. 2.9.1989 and d. Under the 21.9.1989, the government was considering amendments to bring more clarity on what are the essential works to be taken up for public utilities in the Prohibitive Zone within the Blue Line of the river and in the Restricted Zone between the Red Line and the Blue Line. In view of this, a circular is now being issued containing consolidated revised/ updated instructions as follows:

Circular-1. Irrigation Department Government Circular No. FDW 1089/243/89/ SINVYA (Works) D. 2.9.1989 and d. 21.9.1989 is being updated.
The important flood lines are mainly of two types based on the guidelines given in the Dam Safety Manual Chapter 8/ 1984 regarding the use of land in floodplains. Blue Line and Red Line.
Blue Line: The Blue Line is defined as the line drawn by the water level of maximum discharge.
a) Frequent discharge of flood once in 25 years on an average or b) Diffuse discharge of one-tenth of the discharge capacity of the established river bed.
4. Red Line: Red line is defined as the line drawn by the water level of the following discharge.
(a) In areas where there is no dam, the frequency of floods is on an average 1 in 100 years.
(b) The area where the dam will be located:- The envisaged maximum flood discharge from the project's conceptual effluent plus the frequency of the flood discharge from the catchment area under the dam expected to be 100 years.
Prohibitive Zone: The area between the Blue Line on the right bank of the river and the Blue Line on the left bank of the river should be called Prohibitive Zone.
Restricted Zone: The area between the blue line of the river and the red line on the same bank should be called a restricted zone.
7. Prohibitive zone to be used only in the form of open land. With the emergence, playgrounds or light cropping, where the right to grow crops has been established due to traditional use (e.g. Cultivation of watermelon/ watermelon etc. near the river bed should be done only for public toilets and sewerage facilities etc. so that there is no obstruction in the flow of the river, the carrying capacity of the river is not reduced and there is no change in the cutting of the river.

Restrictive zones should be used for the following purposes:
(i) Sewerage schemes necessary and indispensable in the public interest.
(ii) Public roads which are essential and indispensable in the public interest so that the level of the head of the road is above the level of the blue flood line. The level should be determined in accordance with the provisions of the relevant Indian Road Congress Code.
(iii) the laying of water supply pipelines, gas pipelines, drainage pipelines, etc. which are necessary and indispensable in the public interest, so that the pipeline is underground and does not cause any obstruction or alteration in the course of the river in the controlled area.
iv) The level of the footwear of the ground floor of the construction in the containment zone should be above the red flood line level to a safe height so that the citizens can easily move to a safer place before the flood level rises further in the containment zone. It will also be possible for the people, animals and goods of the area to leave the area immediately after receiving the short-term flood warning to avoid possible flooding and loss of life and property due to floods.
The above point no. It should be ensured that the uses mentioned in section 8 do not obstruct the flow of the river, do not reduce the carrying capacity of the river and do not change the cutting area of the river. The chief engineer will be able to take action against constructions that obstruct the flow. The concerned department/ local body shall be fully responsible for the safety of these public works to be carried out in the Prohibited Zone and Restricted Zone and the concerned department/ local body shall be responsible for the loss of life and property due to possible floods and the concerned department/ local body shall be responsible for the court cases arising therefrom.
If the Water Resources Department receives a request from the Collector, Local Self-Government Institutions or other departments regarding the delineation of the necessary flood lines to prevent the possible risk of flooding and to determine the prohibited and controlled area after considering the above, the concerned Regional Chief Engineer of the Water Resources Department may issue a notification in the Government Circular No. No. 424/2014, No. Action to be taken as on 2.3.2015.
As the jurisdiction of the Water Resources Department is limited to the delineation of floodplains along the river banks, no no-objection certificate of the Water Resources Department will be required for the works which are essential and necessary in the public interest mentioned in the above paragraph in the prohibited areas and in the controlled areas.
