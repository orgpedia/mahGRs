Introduction: The Adan Medium Project is built on the Adan River near the village of Mhasni-Pimpri in Karanja Taluka of Washim district, in the Wainganga sub-basin under the Godavari basin under the Vidarbha Irrigation Development Corporation. The project is in the general area. The dam has a right canal of 65 km length.
Under this project, a total of 10067 hectares of area comprising 105 hectares in Manora taluka of Washim district and 9962 hectares in Darbha taluka of Yavatmal district have been irrigated. The construction of the dam was started on 1974 and completed in 1977. The irrigation started partially in 1977 and was completed in 1999, about 20 years ago. As there is a gap in the main canal, water does not reach the tail-end areas.
At present, the project is old and due to lack of regular maintenance and repair, the alignment of the canal and many structures like aqueduct/ tube well/ super passage/ beams etc. have been damaged. Since the canal is contour-type, there is a hill on one side and a flood on the other side, and due to the absence of a zone section, a lot of water flows through this flood. Due to the difference in the bedrock of the main canal on the project, the expected FSD is not available in the next 25 km, so the driving head is not available due to the passage of water from the short span. As a result, the water is not reaching the full capacity of the main canal. The work was taken up at a cost of Rs. 97.73 crore has been granted vide original Administrative Sanction dated 18/09/2019.
