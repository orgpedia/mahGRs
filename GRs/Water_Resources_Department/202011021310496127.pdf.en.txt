31) Devise a formula for the principle of allocation of funds in irrigation sector.
Examine the suggestion regarding diversity of water to Marathwada region from various river basins.
Flow diversion schemes as well as Upasa diversion schemes (river link projects) are being planned to divert water from the basin of abundance in Marathwada or other deficit basins. The priorities of these schemes need to be decided to take these schemes in a phased manner according to the availability of funds.

GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: PARIS- 2019/ (184/2019)/ JASS
One chief engineer from each corporation will be appointed as reference No. The study group has been formed according to the government decision of 1. Thereafter, reference No. As per the Government Preamble of 2003, the scope of work was increased by including the Chief Engineer, Planning and Hydrology, Nashik in the said Study Group. In view of the scope of work of the said Study Group, the time period for effective preparation of the report is mentioned in Reference No. 4 the government decision. It has been extended till May 31, 2019. The report is yet to be received.
The scope of the aforesaid Study Group is wide ranging, such as preparation of parameters of Flow Turning Plan and Upstream Turning Plan for prioritization of river interlinking/ diversion schemes within the State, sub-basin wise study of the availability of water in which basin, from which basin water can be diverted, to determine its primary viability and prioritize accordingly and prepare a report in consonance with the Integrated State Water Framework. Therefore, in order to ensure consistency and speed in the preparation of the report of the study group, the government was considering the following restructuring of the study group and the extension of the term of the study group. Accordingly, the decisions of the government in question are being superseded and the revised government decision is as follows.
Revised Government Decisions: To formulate parameters of Flow Turning Schemes and Upstream Turning Schemes for prioritization of river linkages/ diversion schemes within the State, which basin has the maximum water availability, which one has the highest water availability and which one has the lowest water availability.
The study group is being constituted to carry out sub-basin wise study of diversion of water from the basin, determine its primary feasibility, prioritize accordingly and prepare a report in consonance with the Integrated State Water Resources:
