has been created. Because of the all-round growth of Pune city, slum encroachments
Alternate water pollution, dehydration, and canal damage are occurring on a large scale.
The projected carrying capacity of the canals is 2050 cusecs, actually 1400 through the canal.
Quesx is going so far. This means that at present, the carrying capacity of the canal is only 68 per cent.
In the past, the canal was continuously running within the municipal limits for the water supply of the municipal corporation.
had to be kept. Hence, the lack of maintenance repairs due to the non-availability of the canal closure period.
The filling of the canal has weakened and the protective walls of the canal are almost everywhere.
The canals have collapsed. The canal situation in Pune city is very sensitive.
There is a possibility of the canal bursting in the future. The canal passes through an urban settlement.
The breach is likely to cause loss of life and property. There is an urban settlement near the canal.
The citizens of the canal are using the canal for dumping waste.
The water is contaminated. Also, the canal's portability is due to the roughness in the canal.
As mentioned above, it has decreased. On all the difficulties considering the above background
Renovation and re-maintenance of the canal to overcome regular maintenance repairs instead of new ones.
Mutha Right Canal 1 km to 34 km. I cancelled it and went to Khadakwasla instead.
Connecting the new Mutha right canal from the reservoir to the 34th km near Phursungi
Removing the alternate tunnel will solve all the above-mentioned problems.
