These taluks benefit. A total of 12141 areas are irrigated by the Panjan Left Canal. Five left
A total of 49 years have passed since the construction of the canal, and the irrigation period is plagued by a large number of difficulties. The proposed carrying capacity of the Panjan Left Main Canal is 250 cusecs.
It is moving at only 100 cusecs. In the irrigation cycle, 43 to 53 km of this main canal
There is a large amount of leakage from the filling site and the old UCR lining that was done earlier. To the canal
The irrigation cycle period is increasing due to large-scale wastage of water from constructions, fillings and leaking while the water is running. This results in water in the fields near the canals.
Farmlands are getting submerged due to accumulation, damage to crops and continuous waterlogging.
Similarly, the Panjan left canal leakage has resulted in frequent bursting of the fill and wastage of water.
Due to the increase in the irrigation cycle period of the canal, the farmers of Chalisgaon and Bhadgaon areas do not have access to water during the irrigation period and the income of the farmers decreases.
They become depressed and face the wrath / grievances of the farmers. Therefore, the
A new lining has been proposed at the filling point on the left canal, thus carrying the canal.
Capacity building will help. Also, the water from the canal will stop leaking and the nearby farmers will not lose their agriculture. There is also a possibility of the canal bursting during the current due to filling repairs.
will be reduced.
