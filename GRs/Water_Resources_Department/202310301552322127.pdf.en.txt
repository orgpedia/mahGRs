Introduction: Jayakwadi Project is under the Godavari Irrigation Development Corporation Aurangabad under the Chief Engineer and Chief Administrator Benefit Area Development Authority, Aurangabad. The Jaikwadi project is an ambitious project for the state of Maharashtra and is expected to fill the food grain deficit and make the state self-sufficient in this regard. The work of Jayakwadi Dam was started in 1965 and completed in 1976. The irrigation facility was started in 1976. The Jayakwadi left canal irrigates three districts of Aurangabad, Jalna and Parbhani.
On Paithan left canal 141640 hectare area comes under irrigation.
Paithan main left canal is partially filled at many places, partially dug and fully dug. The canal chain number 47 to 48 km is in spate and partially filled and the pressure of the flowing water has caused a huge slump in the inner side of the canal at that place.
Because of the high rate of decline in the canal, the carrying capacity of the canal is decreasing and the irrigation area is decreasing by creating problems during irrigation management. Irrigation is done from foot to head but due to the bad condition of the canal more than required water has to be released through the canal. This is affecting the water storage in the dam as well as the water planning done by the canal advisory committee. After the completion of these works, the water leakage at km 47 to 48 can be stopped. Also, the revival of the canal will help in reducing the water carrying cost by carrying it as per its original capacity. By reducing the transportation cost of water it will be possible to deliver water to the tail end of the canal in less time.
In this background, the proposal to give administrative approval to the repair works of the 47 to 48 km section of the Paithan Left Canal under a special amendment was under consideration of the government. The government has taken the following decisions:
