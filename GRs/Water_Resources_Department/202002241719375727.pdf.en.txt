There is a huge rush. Tourists coming from Aurangabad and Nagar districts use this asphalt road as the dam footpath is the closest approach to the Paithan dam and the park.
This road is used by all the technical and senior officials of the Water Resources Department for regular maintenance, repair and dam safety works as well as during pre-monsoon and post-monsoon inspection tours.
