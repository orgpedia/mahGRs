-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| The Chandni Medium Project is located at Mau-Pimpalwadi in Paranda taluka of Dharashiv district.                          |
| It is built on the Chandni River near the village. The project was completed in 1965.                                     |
| Irrigation through canals has been introduced since 1966.                                                                 |
| Water storage 23.78 द.ल.घ.म is useful water storage 21.58 द.ल.घ.म and dead water storage 2.204                            |
| The dam has 28 automatic gates. The project is under construction in Maharashtra.                                         |
| Engineering Research Institute, Nashik has done in the year 2015-16 as per the total water storage.                       |
| 13.490 is dilapidated i.e. the capacity of the project due to silt deposited in the dam 10.78                             |
| The length of the project is 23 km with 1 canal.                                                                          |
| The benefit areas of the project include Pimpalwadi, Asu Dagpimpri, Vadner, Awarpimpri, Kapilapuri, Wagagawan and         |
| The irrigated area of the project is 2024 hectares and the cultivable area is 2891 hectares.                              |
| It is a hectare.                                                                                                          |
| Much of the channel of the Chandni Medium Project passes through black soil.                                              |
| There is leakage at places leading to loss of water. The total length of the canal is 23 km.                              |
| There are 35 rescuers coming in, out of which 20 are unwell, so repair work needs to be done.                             |
| Irrigation is affected as the canal does not flow at full carrying capacity due to the accumulation of silt in the canal. |
| After completion of these works, the carrying capacity of the canal is going to be increased, as well as water saving.    |
| Irrigation will increase.                                                                                                 |
|                                                                                                                           |
| Against this backdrop, the budget of Chandni Medium Project, T. Paranda, Dist. Dharashiv is special.                      |
| A proposal for administrative approval under the amendment was under the consideration of the Government.                 |
| Decisions are made as follows.                                                                                            |
|                                                                                                                           |
|                                                                                                                           |
