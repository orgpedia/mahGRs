Department of Water Resources, Government Resolution No: PLN-2017/ PROCESS-22/ NVS-1, Dt. 5.9.2018
Preamble: Baliraja Jal Sanjeevi Yojana (BJY) was submitted to the Central Government for timely completion of irrigation projects under dams in the drought prone areas of Vidarbha and Marathwada and the rest of Maharashtra to prevent farmers' suicides. Cabinet approves grant in aid@ 25% of the cost of balance (Central share) for 91 irrigation projects proposed. It was approved at a meeting held on 18 July 2018. The remaining 75% of the project cost will be funded by NABARD. The project should be completed within the stipulated time frame.
Considering the time taken for grant of revised/ administrative approval to irrigation projects, the number of projects as well as the possibility of increase in the project cost in case of closure of the project due to restrictions on the availability of funds, it is necessary to allow expenditure with certain conditions (including past balance) within the limit of project-wise provision in 2018-19 subject to revised administrative approval.
A proposal was under consideration to approve additional expenditure to the extent of 20% of the approved revised administrative approved cost for the Tembhu project in the erosion prone areas. Accordingly, the following decisions are taken:
Government Decision: The Government is granting approval to the Tembhu project included in the Centrally Sponsored Baliraja Jal Sanjeevi Yojana, subject to the following conditions, subject to the revised administrative approval of the expenditure budgeted, disbursed/ to be incurred in 2018-19, within the limit of 20% of the approved revised administrative approval price.
The revised administrative approval of the project under consideration should be obtained by the department from the competent authority within 3 months.
