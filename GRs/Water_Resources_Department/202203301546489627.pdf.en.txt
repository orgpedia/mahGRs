While the construction of the Mula Dam project was in progress, the construction of the Water Supply Facility (SWF) to measure the discharge of water from the canal to the benefit area was carried out in masonry at km 0/498 CE of the canal during 1972-73. The construction on both sides of the service road and the observation path of the SWF has developed cracks and cracks. At present, the wall of the inspection path has completely collapsed.
