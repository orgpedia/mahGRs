Preamble: 1. Reference No. 36.77 from Bhama-Askhed Project as per Section 1. As per Section 2, non-irrigation reservation of total 75.67 Dalghami was approved out of 38.90 Dalghami.
Reference No. 2. Under Section 3, a proposal has been submitted to the Pune Municipal Corporation, Pune G. Pune for the approval of non-irrigated water reservation from Bhama Askhed reservoir. From this proposal, it appears that the contract could not be signed as the amount of irrigation restoration cost to be paid for the use of non-irrigated water from the Bhama Askhed project was not paid within the stipulated time, so the Chief Engineer has informed that the reservation has automatically lapsed.
The earlier approved reservation is approved by the competent authority at that time and according to the norms and rules prevailing at the competent level. Also according to the government decision in reference 7. Reservations approved prior to 17/11/2016 are intact. There is no need for a new water supply. Therefore, the extension of the deadline for signing the contract as per the approved reservation from the earlier Bhama Askhed reservoir, relaxation in the period for payment of restoration cost and continuation of the approved reservation were under the consideration of the government. The following decisions are being taken:
