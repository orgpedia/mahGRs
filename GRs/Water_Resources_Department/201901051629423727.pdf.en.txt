The Proposal:
The M.P. Project Kelapur G. Yavatmal is a small project built in the year 1977 on a local canal near Muchi village in Kelapur taluka of Yavatmal district.
The catchment area of the project is 6.60 sq km with an average catchment area of 868mm. The length of the dam is 457 metres. The maximum height of the dam is 17.37 metres.
The project is 37.00 m. The maximum permissible discharge of sewage is 112.86 km/ s. The project is 7.50 km long. The length of the left main canal is 0.44 km/ s. The total water storage available in the project is 1.41 LMT which is 1.34 LMT. The total area of the project is 486 hectares. The total irrigation potential of the project is 364 hectares. According to the project report, irrigation was proposed to be done in Kharif and Rabi seasons. At present, 76 hectares of land is being irrigated under this project. The canal's distribution system is in the soil and in some areas the canal has passed through the floodplain. As a result, the river continues to flow in the area. The construction of the canal distribution system has been delayed by 41 years. Because the canal is made of black soil, silt accumulates and the canal bursts from the floodplain. For irrigation irrigation irrigation is done by doing some amount of dyeing. Due to lack of drainage water is not able to reach the tail end of the canal. Due to this, the farmers of Mangurda, Muchhi and Pimpri are deprived of irrigation every year. The local people's representatives, water utility companies and farmers of the area have been demanding this work from time to time.
