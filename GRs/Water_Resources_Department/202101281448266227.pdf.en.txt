Read the above decision here. 6
" Instead of making it mandatory for the Municipal Corporation to pay a lump sum amount towards the cost of irrigation restoration, it should be paid in equal instalments in a phased manner over 5 years from 2018-19. "
Instead, read as follows:
" Out of the total deemed irrigation restoration cost of Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation, the remaining amount should be taken from Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation as irrigation restoration cost after deducting the rehabilitation cost for Bhama Askhed project victims. Instead of making it mandatory for the corporation to pay the said amount in one lump sum, it should be received in equal annual instalments in a phased manner over 5 years from 2020-21. "
