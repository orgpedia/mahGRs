Preamble: As per Section 16 (a) of the Maharashtra Water Resources Act, 2005, Reference No. As per the Government Resolution No. 7, sectoral allocation of water for different categories (drinking, industrial irrigation) has been prescribed and case-wise levels have been fixed for approval of non-irrigated water reservation proposals. Orders were issued regarding non-irrigation water usage agreements, capital cost contribution and irrigation restoration cost through various relevant Government decisions/ circulars.
For the irrigation potential to be reduced due to non-irrigation water reservation, Reference No. Under Government Circular No.3, the cost of restoration of irrigation is Rs. 50,000/- per hectare.
Considering the inflation indexes that have increased since then, Reference No. The cost of irrigation restoration as per Government Circular No.4 is Rs. 1,00,000/- per hectare.
Then reference No. As per the Government decision of 2009, the cost of restoration should be charged at the rate of Rs.1 lakh per hectare, whichever is higher, taking into account the cost inflation index or the prevailing government rate applicable at the time of signing the actual contract.
In terms of the paragraphs in the Project Management Report of the Irrigation Department for the year 2012-13 of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, the Public Accounts Committee shall only take up the cost of restoration for the new reservation or whenever the reservation is renewed, the irrigation area.

Government Resolution No.:- BCI- 2019/ P.S. 150/ C.V. (Dh)
The amendments have been directed to bring clarity on whether or how the restoration cost will be charged for the deduction.
Prior to 2004, there was no provision for levy of restoration cost at the time of approval. Therefore, it is not advisable to introduce new rules. It is not advisable to change the basic condition in the future.
Accordingly, in order to bring clarity on the cost of irrigation restoration, the Government has decided as follows: Government Decision: Circular regarding the assessment of irrigation restoration cost for irrigation efficiency loss due to non-irrigated water reservation. Issued on 21/2/2004. Earlier, there was no provision for recovery of irrigation restoration cost in the non-irrigation water reservation grant. So, here are the guidelines:
1) Basic approval of non-irrigated water reservation. Irrigation restoration cost should not be recovered while renewing/ extending the contract if it is before 21/2/2004.
2) The original approval of non-irrigated water reservation. If awarded after 21/2/2004, the cost of irrigation restoration should be recovered as per the directions in the Government Circular in force at the time of award of the original contract and the cost of irrigation restoration should not be increased retrospectively while renewing the said contracts.
3) The cost of irrigation restoration should not be recouped while carrying out the renovation once it is done.
