Ministry, Mumbai- 400 032.
Date: 16th of March 2021.
Reference:- 1. Executive Director, Vidarbha Irrigation Development Corporation, Nagpur vide letter No.
2509/ Vipavim/ Katan-4/ Poorna M. Project/ IV Suprama/ (Dt. No. 7/18), d. 02/06/2020
Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority's letter No. MWRRA/ 2019/ PRCL/ VIDC/ 112/444 D. 02/09/2020
The Proposal:
The Purna Medium Project has been constructed on the Purna river upstream of Vishroli village near Chandur Bazar in the taluka. The project was completed in 2007 and has been in operation since 2008. The administrative approval for the project was received on 08/07/1994 and the water available for the project is required to be reallocated in accordance with the newly proposed Ganoja-Belora drip irrigation scheme from the field site.
According to the approved project report of the Purna medium project, 52.62 Dalghami water has been planned. It has been observed that there is a huge difference in the actual water use of the project from the original project water use provision and the actual water use as the entire water is not being used in the benefit area for irrigation every year. The Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority has also issued a notification in this regard. The proposal for administrative approval in the proposed Fourth Amendment under Section 11 (f) of the Act has been approved.
The major changes in the original project water use provision and actual water use are as follows:
1.A change in the crop structure.
2. Irrigation from wells in the project area.
3. Water consumption: The actual water consumption is less than the water paid to the organization.
Due to the change in the original project water use provision and actual water use in the above water scheme, the government was considering to finalize the revised balance sheet by reallocating the available water for the Ganoja Belora Tiddibak Irrigation Scheme.
