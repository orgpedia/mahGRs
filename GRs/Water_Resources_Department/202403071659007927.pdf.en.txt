It has been 49 years since the canal construction of the project was completed and the irrigation period is long.
There are problems galore. Conceptual carrying capacity of Panjan Left Main Canal 250 cusecs

A lot of water is being wasted, causing waterlogging in neighbouring fields, damaging crops, and inundating farmlands due to continuous waterlogging. Panjan left canal leakage
Soil fillings have been broken several times and water has been wasted. The irrigation cycle of the canal increases in duration.
