Vipavim/ Kanta 6 (1)/ Pench Re-Planning/ Revised/ 2020, dated 15/01/2020 2) of Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority, Mumbai vide letter No. 438,
dated 03/06/2019
The Proposal:
Under the Pench Project, the Totladoh Hydroelectric Project was completed in 1989, the Navegaon Khairi Dam on the Pench River in 1976 and the Khindsi Dam on the Sur River in 1906. The Pench Irrigation Project has received administrative approval under Government Decision No. PIM 2967/3814 IP (4) Sachivalaya Bombay dated 21/08/1972. As per the sanctioned report, 965 Dalhousie water is planned for irrigation, 689 Dalhousie, Nagpur Municipal Corporation 112 Dalhousie, Koradi Thermal Power Station 67 Dalhousie, Khaparkheda Thermal Power Station 60 Dalhousie, Fisheries 2 Dalhousie, Sunflog Industry, Bhandara 2 Dalhousie and evaporation cost 33 Dalhousie.
According to the actual availability of water at the Totladoh Dam site for 40 years from 1976 to 2016, the Totladoh Dam has a 75% reliable water level of 1157.80. However, the 75% reliability shown in the planning of the screw plant is 1760.90 Dalghami.
The Madhya Pradesh government has constructed a dam at Chaurai with a storage capacity of 577 Dalghami on the Pench river, which has been collecting water since 2016. In the project report of the Pench project, Runoff has been deduced from the annual precipitation by Strange's Coefficient. But due to various projects in the catchment area during the runoff, the catchment area has turned into a" Bad Catchment" due to a significant decrease in the catchment area due to creation of profit zone and urbanization. So there is a difference in the project. As a result, there has been a huge shortfall in the water supply. Similarly, the evaporation cost in the approved plan of Pench project is 33 Dalghami and the actual construction cost is 132 Dalghami. Therefore, water is not available as per the approved water plan of the French project.
The Department of Water Resources, Government of Madhya Pradesh, vide its resolution dated 30/05/2018, has decided to take immediate drought relief measures to overcome the water shortage caused by the depletion of Pench Project in Maharashtra due to the dam at Chaurai in Madhya Pradesh.

was approved. These measures are expected to be implemented soon. Also, the Lohaghogri tunnel project is proposed under the long-term measures. As a long-term measure, the Lohaghogari Tunnel Project has been given administrative approval for the works to be carried out in two phases under the Water Resources Department, Government Decision dated 18/09/2019. The Vidarbha Irrigation Development Corporation (VIDC) has proposed to re-schedule the water use of Pench project in two phases, considering the time taken for completion of these schemes and the availability of water.
Out of the total 9 irrigation schemes approved in principle by the Department of Water Resources, vide Government Resolution dated 30.5.2018, Bid Chichghat Irrigation Scheme, Sihora Irrigation Scheme, Mathani Irrigation Scheme and Babadev Irrigation Scheme have been accorded administrative approval by the Department of Revenue and Forest, vide Government Resolution dated 26/07/2019. The detailed project reports of Chicholi Upasana Irrigation Scheme, Hingna Upasana Irrigation Scheme and Kati Khamari Upasana Irrigation Scheme have been submitted to the government for administrative approval.
Due to the above mentioned reasons, the matter of finalizing the balance sheet of the water use re-planning of Pench project in two phases was under the consideration of the government.
Government's decision:
As per the proposal for reallocation of water use submitted by Vidarbha Irrigation Development Corporation, Nagpur, after the implementation of sub-irrigation scheme in Phase 1- Pench Beneficient Area and after the implementation of sub-irrigation scheme and iron hole tunnel scheme in Phase 2- Pench Beneficient Area, the balance sheet for reallocation of water use in two phases is being approved as follows.
