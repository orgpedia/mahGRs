Establishment of an Inter-Departmental Study Group to decide the parameters and methodology of the State of Maharashtra.
The Government of Maharashtra
The Department of Water Resources,
Government Resolution No: LAKSHVI 2017/ PR No. 362/2017/ LAKSHVI (Works)
Madam Cama Road, Hutatma Rajguru Chowk,
Mantralaya, Mumbai: 400 032.
Date: 25th of May 2022
The Proposal:
Water works are carried out for the reclamation of wetlands/ Kharaba areas in the benefit areas of major, medium and state level minor projects of the Water Resources Department. These works are being done by the Water Resources Department through machines, and similar works are being carried out by the Agriculture Department in the case of other dry farming lands, as well as by the Soil and Water Conservation Department on a large scale. In addition, the work is being done by the Soil and Water Conservation Department with the help of labourers under the Mahatma Gandhi Employment Guarantee Scheme and the parameters of that department are available for it. However, it has been observed that there is a difference in the financial and technical criteria/ parameters used by these four departments in carrying out these works. The financial parameters used in the Water Resources Department were fixed in 1991. However, since then, the financial parameters have not changed and the work on the char schemes under the Water Resources Department has almost stopped in the last full decade due to lack of updated parameters. It is economically and socially more appropriate to recover the wetland/ Kharaba area of the beneficiary area through the works of Char Yojana and to fertilize the barren area than the funds required for this work.
However, the difference in the methodology and technical, financial parameters of all the four departments involved in the desilting of wetlands/ Kharabas creates unnecessary questions. In order to maintain uniformity in the working of government expenditure, it is imperative that all government departments working in tandem should work in tandem. The Planning and Finance Department has agreed to this and the four departments have been instructed to finalize the" Char Scheme Parameters and Methodology Policy" in consultation with each other. The government was considering setting up an inter-departmental study group to take action.
The government is taking the following steps:
Government's decision:
A Study Group is being set up to decide the parameters and methodology of the Char Scheme with all inclusive financial and technical parameters of remedial measures like watershed works, Char Scheme etc. on various types of landforms formed by wetlands/ Kharabas in the entire State.
