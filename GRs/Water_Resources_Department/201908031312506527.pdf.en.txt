Preamble: Under the e-tendering process of the Water Resources Department, under the relevant Government decision, a consolidated revised guidelines have been issued regarding the publication of tenders, opening of tender envelopes and examination and acceptance of tenders. In paragraph 9 and paragraph 2.9 of the said Government Decision, respectively, it was under consideration of the Government to determine the eligibility and subsequent eligibility criteria for tendering under the Hydropower Association and to amend the price escalation clause in the tenders.
Under the Hydropower Association, various activities are carried out in the state, such as construction, testing, operation and repair of hydroelectric projects, sub-irrigation schemes, dam sites and project settlements. The electrical and mechanical works of hydroelectric power plants such as main generator, mill yard and ancillary equipment and the production of electrical equipment, transmission lines etc. in the mill yard of irrigation schemes are based on the concept. Also, the concept of these devices varies from case to case. Thus, since most of the electrical appliances are tailor-made and specialized, it is important to manufacture and supply electrical appliances according to the concept and specification of the work. Also, the operation and maintenance of electrical appliances also require experienced reagents in the electrical field. The contractor who is doing the electrical work through an external agency must have experience in this particular work. It is necessary to check the technical qualifications of the contractor.
However, para 9 of the above referred Government Decision provides for determining the competence of the contractor to tender only for works above Rs. 1.5 crore to Rs.5 crore budgeted cost. In view of the nature of works under the Hydropower Association, a proposal has been submitted to the Government by the Chief Engineer (Power), Hydropower Project, Mumbai, to fix a specific limit on the provisions regarding post qualification criteria for works under the Hydropower Association in the above referred Government Decision and to amend the price escalation clause in the tenders. Accordingly, the matter of fixing separate post qualification criteria for works under the Hydro Power Corporation and amending the price escalation clause in tenders was under the consideration of the Government. A decision in this regard is being taken.
