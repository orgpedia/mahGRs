Reference:- Government Decision, Water Resources Department No. Narrow- 2019/75/2019)/ JSA, Dy. August 23, 2019.
The Proposal:
1.0 In the National Perspective Plan prepared by the Central Government in 1980, a total of 30 inter-state river interlinking schemes were envisaged. Out of the above 30 interlinking projects, two inter-state projects namely Damanganga-Pinjal (Maharashtra) and Par-Tapi-Narmada (Gujarat) are proposed in the States of Maharashtra and Gujarat.
Under the Damanganga-Pinjal river link project, 895 Dalghami (31.60 LH) water is proposed to be released to Mumbai city for drinking purposes. Under the Par-Tapi-Narmada interlinking project, a total of 1330 Dalghami (46.96 LHF) of water will be available from the catchment areas of Maharashtra and Gujarat for irrigation and drinking water in Saurashtra and Kutch regions of Gujarat.
A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the Governments of Maharashtra, Gujarat and the Union of India for preparation of Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) for two inter-State schemes namely Par-Tapi-Narmada and Damanganga-Pinjal through River Development Agency (NWDA), New Delhi. The MoU has been signed on 03/05/2010. A project report is being prepared.
The MoU dated May 3, 2010 stipulates that the State of Maharashtra shall undertake a feasibility study for utilisation of the available water from the Western Diversion to the Eastern Diversion. Accordingly, as per the study done by the State of Maharashtra, the following diversion scheme is proposed for Girna sub-basin and Godavari basin of Tapi valley.
1) Nar-Par-Girna 304.60 Dalghami, (10.76 Aghfu) 2) Par-Godavari 97 Dalghami, (3.42 Aghfu) 3) Damanganga-Vaitarna-Godavari 202 Dalghami, (7.13 Aghfu) 4) Damanganga-Ekdare-Godavari 143 Dalghami, (5.0 Aghfu)

Detailed Project Reports of the above schemes are under progress through two Government of India initiatives namely National Water Development Agency, New Delhi and WAPCOS, New Delhi. These 4 diversion schemes were proposed to be implemented as national projects along with Par-Tapi-Narmada and Damanganga-Pinjal inter-state river linking schemes and accordingly the draft MoU was submitted to the Central Government. Submitted on 22/09/2017.
The Gujarat government is yet to agree on the proposed water sharing between the two states in the inter-state river linking project as per the draft MoU. Negotiations at the level of Chief Secretary are in progress and two years have been lost in the process and the concurrence of the State of Gujarat is yet to be obtained. Due to the complexities of water sharing between the two states in the proposed Par-Tapi-Narmada and Damanganga Pinjal inter-state river linking project, attempts are being made at the local level to create false confusion among the people that" Maharashtra water is being given to Gujarat."
In view of the above reasons, the matter of implementing the above inter-state and under-state projects in the state of Maharashtra as an under-state project from the state's own funds was under the consideration of the government for providing benefits expeditiously instead of taking it as a national project.
2.0 An estimated 370 million cubic feet of surplus water is left in the Nar-Par, Damanganga, Vaitarna and Ulhas river basins in north Konkan. Out of this, provision has been made for diversion of 115 Aghfu water to Godavari basin in Integrated State Watershed. Out of these, a total of 168.75 Agfu water diversion schemes are provided for diversion of water from Konkan to Godavari basin for utilization of 2.72 Agfu completed/ under construction diversion schemes, 25.6 Agfu water diversion schemes for which project reports are ready and 140.43 Agfu water diversion schemes for which survey is proposed.
The matter of approval for preparation of Detailed Project Report after completion of preliminary study of above 140.43 Aghfu water utilization diversion/ lift schemes and survey and investigation of viable schemes was under consideration of the Government.
3.0 The Seventh meeting of the State Water Council has approved the Vainganga (Gosikhurd)-Nalganga (Purna-Tapi) river link project. The detailed project report of the proposed scheme has been prepared by the National Water Development Agency and it is proposed to divert 62.77 Aghfu water. Large-scale land acquisition in this river-linking project

In order to avoid this, the government was considering to approve the re-survey work to be taken up immediately by proposing a tube/ tunnel instead of a large-scale canal.
dated 30.7.2019. A presentation was made in the cabinet meeting on the above matter and as per the decision taken on it, in-principle approval will be given to the schemes to divert water from Konkan for drought-affected Marathwada. The Government decision has been issued on 23.8.2019. On this subject. on 28.8.2019. The decision was taken at a Cabinet meeting held here to give in-principle approval to schemes to divert water from the Konkan for drought-hit Marathwada. The Cabinet of Ministers has approved the inclusion of Girna sub-basin in the decision taken on 30.7.2019.
He gave it. The Government Decision dated 23.8.2019 is being superseded and the revised Government Decision is as follows:
Government's decision:
1. Inter-State Damanganga-Pinjal River Link Project and inter-State Damanganga-Vaitarna-Godavari and Damanganga-Ekdare-Godavari etc.
It should be implemented as an inter-state project.
(2) The above river interlinking projects are mainly for the deficit and high-tide basin areas of Girna sub-basin in Marathwada. Request to the Governor. The governor should do it.
The proposed river linking projects have been divided into the jurisdiction of different corporations. Therefore, a separate Chief Engineer's Office (Chief Engineer, River Link Specific Project) should be established directly under the government for the integrated and integrated implementation of the project and the post of Chief Engineer (River Link Project) should be created for this.
4. Remaining work of detailed survey/ investigation of the following proposed river linking projects to be taken up. Their preliminary investigation reports, detailed project reports should be prepared and submitted to the government for further approval after examining their feasibility.
(a) Proposed Godavari Basin (29 schemes, 168 Aghfu water utilization) and Girna Sub-Basin diversion scheme from Ulhas, Vaitarna, Nar-Par and Damanganga Sub-Basins.

(b) Re-examination of the proposal for a canal instead of a tube well/ tunnel to avoid land acquisition in the Wainganga-Nalganga river link scheme.
