English Government Circular MIP 2274/19700-IP-3D. January 17, 1975.
3) Government Circular No. Purani/ (182/2018)/ Simvya Revenue Dy. May 3, 2018.
Preamble: 1. Guidelines for acquisition of lands and structures affected by minor irrigation projects Reference No. 1 was issued. The reference No. The circulars of 2 have been issued collectively for large, medium and small project reservoirs without gates and with gates. As per these guidelines, the land and structures to be acquired have been notified taking into account the flood frequency of the project site. According to the circular, the construction of structures affected by the Inglis Flood or the 100-year recurring flood should be carried out.
Reference No. 2. Under Section 3, guidelines have been issued for delineation of floodplains for demarcation of prohibited areas and controlled areas along the river. According to the guidelines, areas affected by floods with a frequency of 25 years will be declared as containment zones. Construction is prohibited in these areas.
On the basis of this principle, it will be necessary and appropriate to acquire construction on the upstream side of the dam, which is affected by 25 years of recurrent floods. However, constructions affected by floods of much greater frequency (100 years) than that prescribed by the 1975 circular are being acquired. Hence, the government is reluctant to take up such projects. In order to remove this anomaly, the Government was considering revising the frequency of floods to be considered for acquisition of construction works from" English Flood" to" 25 Years Frequent Flood" in the guidelines of the 1975 Circular.
Government Decision: English Government Circular MIP 2274/19700-II for acquisition of lands and houses affected by water bodies on upstream of major, medium and minor projects. The P-3. The following criteria were adopted on January 17, 1975:
1) Land: a) For non-irrigated water bodies: All land up to full reservoir level+ 1/2 flood lift should be acquired.

(b) For Permeable Reservoirs: The full storage level of the dam is+ 1/2 m. (0.5 m) or 20m. All the lands should be acquired till the horizontal distance whichever is less.
2) Housing: a) For non-turbid water bodies: Maximum water level of 25 years recurring flood is+ 1/2 m. height or 20 feet. All the houses should be edited till the horizontal distance is less than this.
(b) For brackish water bodies: Maximum water level of+ 1 m for 25 years of recurrent floods (taking into account the impact of backwaters). height or 75 meters. All the houses should be edited till the horizontal distance is less than this. In doing so, the maximum levels of inflow due to the upstream of the dam should be taken into account for the following two scenarios: (1) Levels that are prone to frequent flooding for 25 years when the dam is not in existence.
(2) The level of the backwater which is subject to 25 years of recurrent floods when the dam is full to the full storage level.
The nearest point from the dam where the difference between the above (1) and (2) levels is less than 10 cm shall be the place where the impact of the water from the dam is lost. The length from the dam to such place shall be divided into 10 to 15 equal parts and the houses in each such part shall be acquired for the maximum permissible water level found for the situation (2).
In cases where the land acquisition has not yet been concluded according to the official circular, further action should be taken by examining the need for acquisition according to the criteria in this decision.
