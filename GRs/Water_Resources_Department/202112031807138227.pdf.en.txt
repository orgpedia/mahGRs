the prelude
The water resources department mainly deals with two types of activities, namely construction and irrigation management. Construction activities are decreasing day by day and the work in irrigation management is increasing. With the increase in the irrigation area every year, the pressure on irrigation management has increased to a great extent. In 2005, the government
The Maharashtra Management of Irrigation System by Farmers Act, 2005 has been enacted, under which the project beneficiaries are expected to participate in irrigation management on a large scale. Therefore, water use institutions at various levels should be established and implemented by the government in the traditional way.
The management and distribution of incoming water is expected to be done by the beneficiary agencies in a phased manner. At present, about 5500 institutions have been established under this Act in Maharashtra, out of which very few have been fully involved. Maharashtra Engineering Training Academy (META) is planning to provide the proposed courses so that the local general public and the younger generation can participate in this work by creating interest among the people about the action to be taken on water management, through awareness and information.
The government is taking the following steps in this regard:
Government Decision: 1. Maharashtra Engineering Training Academy for Irrigation Management under Water Resources Department
Candidates who have completed the following certificate courses as prescribed by NAC will be eligible to receive the certificate.
