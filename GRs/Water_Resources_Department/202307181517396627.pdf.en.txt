Reference: Committee empowered to recommend the acceptability of innovative technologies. Minutes of the 7th meeting held on 23.11.2021.
Introduction:
To promote the use of innovative technologies in the Water Resources Department. The Technology Approval Mechanism has been set up under the Government Decision dated 27.05.2015. According to 2. As per the Government decision dated 28.11.2016, a Empowered Committee has been constituted to make recommendations on the acceptability of innovative technologies. The Committee examines the financial and technical feasibility of adopting innovative technologies, building materials, machinery, project concept and design, construction methods for various project components in the Water Resources Department and makes recommendations to the Government for further action at the Government level.
Introduced Backfill Retaining Walls with Easy Horizontal Platforms technology and its advantages:
In this technology, horizontal platforms have been proposed in the concept of retaining walls, which helps to increase the stability of retaining walls and reduce their size compared to conventional retaining walls.
In places where there is less area available for retaining walls, there is no need to edit additional space. Therefore, it is possible to build these walls by excavating less within the limits of the available space, and this saves the cost of cutting and backfilling.
This type of retaining walls takes less time to build compared to other technologies.

According to the concept of this Wall, due to the provision of Weep holes and filters, if the construction is to be done in the rainy season, water can flow properly from the surface and the stability of the Wall is not adversely affected.
The walls constructed according to this technology are stable in static and seismic conditions. This technology prevents rock fall. Also, the life of the walls constructed with this technology is generally equal to that of RCC retaining walls.
Recommendations of the committee:
In the seventh meeting of the Empowered Committee on Adaptability of Innovative Technologies, the Committee on" Introjected Backfill Retaining Walls with Easy Horizontal Platforms" observed that the use of this technology is generally found to be useful in retaining walls that are more than six meters high. It is recommended that the concept of retaining walls should be examined by the Central Conceptual Association, Nashik before using this technology.
As per the recommendations of the Empowered Committee for Adoption of Innovative Technologies, the following recommendations are being issued:
Circular:
"Introjected Backfill Retaining Walls with Easy Horizontal Platforms"
The use of this technology should be done with the consent of the Regional Chief Engineer in the height of the bird more than six meters.
Since the technology is patented, the scope of the patent and the legal aspects should be studied by the field engineer and decide on the use of the technology.
3. The concept should be examined/ evaluated by the concerned Board at Central Concept Picture Organization, Nashik before using the said technology.
