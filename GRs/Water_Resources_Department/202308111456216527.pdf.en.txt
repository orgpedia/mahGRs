Introduction: The Arunavati Project is a major irrigation project in Digras Taluka of Yavatmal district. It is built on the river Arunavati. Work on the project began in May 1980 and was completed in June 1994. Since 1995, irrigation has been going on in the areas where the distribution system has been completed. The construction of the irrigation capacity of the project has been completed by the end of June 2008. The built-up irrigation potential of the project is 24003 hectares and the envisaged live water storage is 169.69 LHT.
The right main canal of Arunavati Project is devoid of lining and the canal has a large number of trees and bushes, silt has accumulated and the canal is clogged. Also, a large amount of water is lost through the canals and waterways. As a result of this, irrigation in the last part of the canal is decreasing and the beneficiaries are facing the wrath of not getting water from the planned discharge to the last end. The water is leaking due to the overflowing of the canal at various places, which has caused a threat to the adjacent agricultural land, and the agricultural land is being damaged due to the leakage/ leakage from the canal's fill and various constructions.
Accordingly, 0 to 46 km of Arunavati Project will be constructed. A proposal to give administrative approval to the right main canal repair work in I under special repair was under the consideration of the government. The government has taken the following decisions:
