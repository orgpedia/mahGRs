Introduction: Gandheshwar Minor Project is located to the east of Gandheshwar village on the Gana River. The project received administrative approval in 1996 and was completed in 2004. The catchment area of the project is 47.31 sq km. The project envisages irrigation of 487 hectares through a 5.50-km canal on the left bank. The death toll stands at 0.774. The length of the project is 322 m. The estimated discharge of sewage is 840.92 g/ s. The submerged area of the project is 112.50 hectares.
The construction of the main canal, aqueduct, CR gate, VRB, CTB, etc. on the Gandheshwar mini project is in disarray. Due to the breakage of the aqueduct at Chain No. 2300 and Chain No. 3800 on the main canal, water is flowing on both sides of the aqueduct and water is not moving through the canal. Therefore, the main canal and canal are being repaired.
Soil work and pitching on the top of the dam on the main dam have been affected to a great extent. A large amount of water is also leaking from the dam.
Against this backdrop, the Gandheshwar Small Project Ltd. has been formed to repair the main dam from the point of view of dam safety and to repair the canal in order to increase the irrigation area. The proposal to give administrative approval to the budget of the main dam and canal works of the Kannad, G. Aurangabad project under special amendment was under consideration of the government. The government has taken the following decisions:
