Reference: Government Circular No. Irrigation 2015 / No.24 / (Part-II) / 2015 / As (Policy), D. 02.02.2017.
The Proposal:
The government has a policy of canal irrigation. Determined by the decision on 09.06.2016. Thereafter, it was decided to address the bottlenecks for speedy and efficient implementation of the policy. 09.06.2016
The government's decision has been reversed. Government Decision Issued on 13.01.2017
was done. It was followed by a discussion on the distribution system policy through tube. The guidelines were circulated through a government circular dated 02.02.2017.
Farmers' organizations in the period after the expansion of the separate policy on the tube-well distribution system,
Demands were received from citizens as well as contractors to reform the policy.
In view of the changes in technology and faster completion of field works, the above mentioned tenders have been floated.
Coherence and simplification of the tube distribution policy in line with the proposal received regarding change in procedures.
Changes need to be made to bring about. Also, several proposals have been received by the government to provide water outside the benefit areas from the water saved from the tube distribution. Therefore, the state's water resources are diverse.
Provisions of the Act, guidelines of the Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority, out of the purview
Tube by exchanging / studying the water requirement of the area, etc. on demand.
To propose reforms in the distribution system policy. The committee was constituted by a government decision on 19.04.2023. The committee constituted by the Report received on 21.07.2023
Consider all of these things. The Government Circular dated 02.02.2017 reads as follows:
Improvements are being made.
Government Corrigendum: -
Issue No. 3 of the Government Circular, p. mentioned in 1.9.
"Area coverage of irrigation projects in the state is considered to be Crop Area (CCA), Forestry Area (ICA) etc. In general, ICA is 70 to 80 percent of CCA.
Thus, the area of the lag is in the direct benefit zone compared to the available water. or
It is not possible to prevent farmers from drawing water to excess areas. Further, the proposed project envisages a reserve area to be provided within the permissible limits from water bodies and canals.
No. Similarly, industrialization due to increased urbanization has led to a greater risk of relapse in the future.
The water is periodically diverted for non-irrigated purposes. As a result, most of the state's
There has been a massive build-up of water projects and irrigation systems.

The purpose should be to bridge the gap. However, the project should be watertight with the help of a channel distribution proposal.
The increase outside the sanctioned area is due to the proposal of the Irrigation Department without prior approval. "
In lieu of this
Crop Area (CCA) and Planned Irrigation Area while determining the area of benefit of irrigation projects in the state
(ICA) are the two terms considered. Generally, ICA is 70 to 80 percent of CCA.
Hence, the area under cultivation is actually more in the beneficiary area than the available water. The reason for saving
The priorities for use should be as follows: -
i. Saving water as per State Water Policy First for drinking water demand (Drinking water)
water demand) should be used.
ii. Saving of area under irrigation project on which non-irrigation has led to reduction in irrigated area (ICA).
The water should be restored.
iii.After this, the gap between CCA and ICA will be reduced by 15 percent and the remaining water will be saved.
Technical and financial feasibility checks if there is demand from outside the benefit sector.
should be given to the adjacent area. (e.g. CCA of a project is 1100 hectares and ICA is 1000 hectares)
If so, the difference between CCA and ICA is 100 hectares. It covers a gap of 85 hectares.
Drainage and the rest of the saved water can be released outside the benefit area. )
For projects in areas prone to precipitation, the above-mentioned limit should be raised to 25 per cent. (For example, one of the
If the CCA of the project is 1100 hectares and ICA is 1000 hectares, the difference between CCA and ICA is 100.
Hector is coming. Out of this, 75 hectares should be filled up and the remaining water saved.
Can be given outside the benefit area. ) "

Similarly, the contractor also tends to delay / delay the transaction.
The tender should include the supply side or linkage with the supply side on the irrigation sector.
The refilling on the side of the tube with the jointset should be supported by the necessary pressure.

In lieu of this
U V degradation occurs if the PVC tube is exposed to sunlight for a long period of time.
It's going to be Brittle. If the tender has two separate items, supply and connection, the contractor's emphasis is on supply.
Problems at work cause the duct to become brittle if the duct connection is delayed.
Also, the contractor has a tendency to avoid / delay the connection work. But the contractor
It is also the fact that the pipe is not supplied without payment to the pipe supplier. The matter
Considering the minimum of the pipe rates in the CSR to the contractor and the invoice they submitted.
50 per cent of the amount is being allowed for supply, however, on-field tube connections are permitted.
The concerned Executive Engineer should take care of supplying the tubes as per the progress of the work. Also 2 out of 3 pages
