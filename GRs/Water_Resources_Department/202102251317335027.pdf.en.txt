Government circular 11.08.2020 on page No. Paragraph 3.6 above should read as follows:
" Before using artificial sand for composting, the concrete mix design of such composting should be done from the quality control laboratory under the Water Resources Department. If the quality control laboratory is not able to do the composite design in the stipulated time for some reason, then in such a case there is no problem in getting the composite design done from the laboratory under MARI, Nashik or from a private laboratory certified by NABL (National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories). This MIX design should be approved by the Superintending Engineer of the concerned board office. While granting such approval, the concerned Superintending Engineer shall ensure that the action is taken in accordance with paragraph 2 of this circular.
