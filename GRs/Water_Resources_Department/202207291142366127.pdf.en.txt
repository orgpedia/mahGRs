Preamble: Government Circular regarding revision of norms for distance from maximum flood level for undertaking tourism development works in the upstream and downstream areas of the dam excluding the prohibited areas in the reservoirs of major, medium and minor projects of the Water Resources Department, Water Resources Department No. 02/08/2013 and instructions have been issued. The purpose of this circular was to prevent possible pollution of the reservoir from the upstream of the dam and also to ensure that safety and security are not threatened near the dam.
The distance is too much and the officials and people's representatives had demanded to improve it to boost tourism and other development works. Therefore, the Government Circular, Water Resources Department No. Narrow- 2012/ (Q. No. 20/2012)/ C.V. (M), Dy. 02/08/2013 vide Government Circular, Water Resources Department No. Narrow- 2012/ (Q. No. 20/2012)/ C.V. (Revenue), Dy. The revised instructions have been issued vide 08/03/2018.

Most of the large and medium dams in the state of Maharashtra supply drinking water to the surrounding cities and rural areas. For example, water is supplied to Pune Municipal Corporation, Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation and surrounding municipal councils and gram panchayats from Khadakwasla, Panshet, Varasgaon, Pavana, Mulshi etc. dams in Pune city. However, in the present Government Circular, Water Resources Department No. 2012/ (Q. No. 20/2012)/ CV (Revenue), Dy. In 08/03/2018, a large number of development works and tourism development works have been carried out in the vicinity of the dams in accordance with the prescribed norms. As a result, due to these development works, a large amount of sewage is being generated in the vicinity of the dam and this sewage is being discharged into the dam without processing as per the existing government norms. Pune: The Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) has detected E-Coli in the water of Khadakwasla dam. The same situation is being observed in large and medium dams supplying water to various cities in Maharashtra. In the future, considering the increasing development works and increasing population, the problem of sewage discharged into the dam/ natural streams is going to be very serious.
Accordingly, the Government Circular, Water Resources Department No. 20/2012)/ C.V. (Revenue), Dy. Further revision of the prohibited distance norms as on 08/03/2018 was under consideration of the Government. Therefore, the Government Circular, Water Resources Department No. Narrow- 2012/ (Q. No. 20/2012)/ C.V. (Revenue), Dy. 08/03/2018 is being amended as under:
Circular-
Tourism or other development works can be carried out in the following areas considering that there will be no threat to the safety and security of the construction of dams and other components excluding the water bodies or other restricted areas of the large, medium and small irrigation projects of the Water Resources Department.
(1) In respect of development activities other than townships in the upstream areas of the dam,
(a) Large and Medium Projects- 200 m from the upstream flood bulge (HFL) of the dam.
Horizontal distance will be the restricted area.
(b) Minor project- 75 m from the upstream flood bulge (HFL) of the dam. Horizontal distance will be the restricted area.
This restricted area can be used as a green belt and no development work should be carried out in it.
(2) For townships on the upper reaches of the dam-
(a) Horizontal distance of 300 metres from HFL shall be the restricted area in respect of large and medium projects.
(b) Horizontal distance of 200 metres from HFL shall be the restricted area in respect of minor projects.

This restricted area can be used as a green belt and no development work should be carried out in it.
3) For Industrial Township Estate, the necessary things should be followed as per the government decisions, circulars, etc. issued by the Department of Environment from time to time and the amendments to it from time to time in the future.
4) The distance from the construction of the dam or project component is being determined as follows. The prohibited area and other distances should be measured from the downstream side of the toe drain in case of earthen dam and from the end sill on the EDA of the sewer, where there is no toe drain, the distance should be measured beyond the toe+ 10 meters.

| A.A.                 |                                                        |  rate/ height of the work area     | unbridled distance                                                         | Limits of the excavation room |
| 1                    | From 5 to 10 meters                                    | The 50 meters                      | No more than 1 meter above ground level can be dug in the prohibited area. |
| From 10 to 30 meters | 10 times the height or 150 meters, whichever is higher |
| 3                    | more than 30 meters                                    | 350 meters or 10 times the height. |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(5) The above prohibited distances in the same dam shall be in proportion to the height of the place on the dam line, i.e. less distance at lower height and more distance at higher construction site. This distance will be the aerial distance. That is, the distance to be allowed will not depend on the maximum height of the dam, but on the height of the construction of the dam at that place along the dam line.
6) The ancillary provisions of the Integrated Development Control and Promotion Protocol (UDCPR) of the Urban Development Department shall continue to apply.
7) The distance from the river bed on the downstream side of the dam and the nature of the development work to be done/ construction etc. F. 2018/ (182/2018) C.V. (Revenue), Dy. It will remain as on 03/05/2018.
8) The Chief Engineer of the project concerned may declare an area of additional distance/ specific location as prohibited area for development for the purpose of access control for the safety of a particular dam/ structure or for dam safety due to specific geological conditions. However, there are reasons for this.
Water in the reservoir/ river will not be polluted. Also, the developers will have to ensure that the effluent does not get mixed with the water bodies (directly or indirectly).
10) The prohibited distance criteria mentioned in this decision are for the safety and security of the dam/ structure. For example, other departments. If there are some norms of the departments like Environment, Revenue and Forest, Industry, Energy and Labour, and Urban Development, then the developers will also have to follow it.

11) It will be mandatory for the local bodies to follow the prohibited distance criteria mentioned in this decision while allowing development works. While granting approval for development works/ tourism etc.
Permission shall be subject to the condition that the effluents generated shall be treated within the limits of the parameters prescribed by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board and revised by it from time to time.
12) In order to control the future development work, the developer should submit a detailed plan of the planned activity along with the land use plan to the Water Resources Department to get a no-objection certificate.
The order was issued by the Urban Development Department vide reference No. 42/2022 dated 25/07/2022 is being issued as per the consent received.
