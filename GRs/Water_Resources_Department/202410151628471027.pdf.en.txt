Introduction: The state of Maharashtra has two major perennial rivers and two tributaries that flow in the monsoon season every year.
During the monsoon season, these rivers are flooded on a small scale. In this flood, adjacent urban and peri-urban areas
The spread of water also causes financial losses every year. Government assistance and rehabilitation by making panchnama of these losses.
The department also has to provide financial assistance to the affected. This results in the government earning revenue in both ways every year.
There were losses.
Overall, global warming did not cause widespread precipitation.
Concentrated rainfall has increased in the form of cloudbursts over a short period of time. On this large scale,
In urban areas, the resulting rainfall causes flooding, resulting in loss of life and property. It's the same way
Flood situation was created in various cities in the years 2005, 2006, 2011, 2019 and 2022.
Landslides in the adjacent hilly areas along with flood water during the monsoon season lead to mud, stones, boulders, sand, etc.
Many such substances flow into the river and gradually accumulate in the lower reaches of the river, causing the formation of marshy islands in such places.
are prepared. It also impedes the drainage of floodwater, reducing the river's carrying capacity.
are created. Also, urbanization, construction, felling of trees, roads and rail transport in the catchment areas of the rivers.
The filling and dredging work for the etc. led to the discharge of silt into the water, narrowing the river basin and
It becomes shallow.
Exploring the causes of the flood situation in Krishna and Bhima valleys in 2019 and the future

Out of the total length of major rivers in the state, urban / urban traffic flows through 1608.83.
Red and yellow flood lines have been drawn along the km length. its information to the relevant government.
In Annexure-I of the judgment, B is displayed on the website of the Water Resources Department. The ones that are
There is a large amount of obstruction in the flow of the arteries by siltation in the length. from such an area.
Siltation is proposed in the first phase. These rivers and their lengths are in Annexure-I.
has been shown. All the lengths mentioned in this Annexure-I shall be drawn at the same time or silt
The longer the length to be removed, the longer the obstruction is in the first stage and the rest of the length.
Remove in the next step. The field engineers should look into the matter and submit a report to the chief engineer.
They have to do it and they have to accept it.
2. Determine the size and depth of the hole:
After determining the length of the siltation as mentioned above, the actual survey will determine the perpendicularity of the area and
The size of the hole should be removed by cutting. For this, the origin of the river is important in the natural gradient and river basin.
Deepening of the river for maximum possible flood water velocity considering bridges, other sites, etc.
