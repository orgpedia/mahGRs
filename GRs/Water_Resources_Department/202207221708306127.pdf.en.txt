Preamble: Minor Irrigation Project Waghera Ta. Trimbakeshwar, which is located 40 km from Nashik district, is located on a local rivulet of the Godavari basin near Vaghera village in Trimbakeshwar taluka.
The construction of the project was completed in 1993 and the project is transferred to irrigation management. The total built-up area of the project is 3.694 ha. The right bank of the project has a 4 km long right canal on which 75 hectares of irrigation area is submerged and on the left bank 10 km long canal is being constructed. The left canal is 337 hectares long.
The Waghera project falls in a high rainfall region with an average rainfall of 2000 mm in the project area. The left canal of the project crosses many natural drains in the initial 2.00 km length and the canal breaks at many places due to flooding of drains in the rainy season.
As a result, water cannot flow in the channel. Therefore, permanent measures are required to be taken in the initial 2 km length of the said canal. As the structures on the canal are in stone wall and have been lying for more than 25 years, most of the structures are weak/ dilapidated and have collapsed to a great extent. Both the canals of the project have been closed for the last 20 years and today the benefit area of Mauje Vaghera village is being irrigated by rotating the river on the project. However, most of the farmers are deprived of water. The local people have demanded immediate repair of the roads. In this background, the Vaghera L.P. Project. The proposal to give administrative approval to the budget for the repair of the left canal of the Trimbak, G. Nashik project under special amendment was under consideration of the government. The government has taken the following decisions:
Government Decision: Godawari Marathwada Irrigation Development Corporation, Aurangabad Under Waghera L.P. Project Ltd. Trimbak, G.
