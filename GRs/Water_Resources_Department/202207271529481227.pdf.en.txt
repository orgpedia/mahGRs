The Proposal:
The Mula Irrigation Project consists of two major canals, the Mula Right Bank Canal and the Mula Left Bank Canal. The original right bank canal is 52 km long and was completed in 1972-73. The projected water carrying capacity from the origin is 1650 cusecs. The water management of the entire benefit area of the Mula Dam project has been transferred to the Water Utilization Agency since 2006. All water use agencies are functional and water is being metered as per demand at government rates.
The construction of the canal has been completed for 50 years and the canal irrigates the area in all three seasons- kharif, rabi and summer. As per the field inspection carried out by the field officers, there was a lot of damage to the alignment at various places in the Mula Right Canal/ Final Distribution, leakage and erosion from the canal, the canal cut was less than the planned cut and hence the planned discharge was not being achieved, many structures on the canal were collapsing and leaking from it, the filling of the canal was found to be in a dangerous condition at some places and the local people's representatives had also demanded for the repair of the canal, so the proposal to give administrative approval under special amendment to the canal repair budget on the Mula Right Canal/ Final Distribution was under consideration of the government. The government has taken the following decisions:
