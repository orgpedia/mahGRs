Preamble: Reference No. The government has taken 2 decisions. The field officials had referred to the government the modalities for scrutinizing the technical envelopes of the tenders so called for. While preparing the tender document for the small hydroelectric projects to be developed through privatization, the available water reserves for the proposed hydroelectric project, water use chart, various ponds, available land, topography are available from the architectural office associated with the project and based on that tenders are invited. On receipt of Government approval for evaluation report of the tender, Letter of Permission (LoP) is issued to the promoter, after which the promoter submits Techno Economic Feasibility Report (TEFR) to the office of the Superintending Engineer, Koyna Conceptual Board, Pune. Once the TEFR receives government approval, the Letter of Allotment is issued to the promoter by the office of the Superintending Engineer, Koyna Sankalp Chitra Mandal, Pune and the Hydroelectric Project Development Agreement (HPDA) is signed by the offices of the Regional Chief Engineer (Architecture) and the project development is controlled under them. Accordingly, the government was considering the formation of a scrutiny committee comprising architectural and electrical representatives for the technical scrutiny of the tenders invited by adopting the post-qualification method for the hydroelectric projects being developed through privatization and proposed for renovation and modernization.
