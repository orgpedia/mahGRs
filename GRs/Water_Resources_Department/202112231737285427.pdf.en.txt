The Proposal:

This dam provides irrigation to the farmers of the villages of Kair tehsil. The length of the embankments of the project is 62.80 m. The total mandate area of the project is 358 hectares, cultivable area is 325 hectares, irrigated area is 223 hectares and irrigation potential is 223 hectares. According to the project report, irrigation was proposed to be done in Kharif and Rabi seasons. At present, 90 hectares of land is under irrigation. The dam is nearly 120 years old and most of the length of the canal and the distribution system is of black soil type. Due to heavy rains and many years of construction, the canal and the distribution system are largely in disrepair, so it is not possible to irrigate the entire length of the canal.
