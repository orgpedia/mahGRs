As per the Government Resolution No. 2. 1 decision has been revoked.
Regarding the work done by the external authority under the mechanical organization. " Different members of the same family have registered different firms and they have participated in the tender competition and got a large number of works approved. " Some firms have themselves as directors, some as directors and some as directors of HUF. Accordingly, as per the provisions of Section 12 (3) of the Maharashtra Lok Ayukta and Upa Lokayukta Act, 1971, the Upa Lokayukta had recommended the issuance of a Government Circular in respect of the order in the hearing. A government circular is being issued as follows to ensure fair competition under the tender process.
