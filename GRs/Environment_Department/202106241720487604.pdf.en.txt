The Maharashtra (Urban Areas) Protection and Preservation of Trees Act, 1975, has been passed by the state government in October 2020.
With a view to making important provisions in the Maharashtra (Urban Areas) Protection and Preservation of Trees Act, 1975 with regard to protection, conservation and preservation of environment, the State Cabinet has recently approved the proposal to incorporate amendments in the Act and convert it into an Act. The proposed amendments to the Maharashtra (Urban Areas) Protection and Preservation of Trees Act, 1975 are annexed as Annexure-I. Accordingly, the process of making this amendment is being carried out independently at the government level.
Until the said amendments are incorporated in the Maharashtra (Urban Areas) Protection and Preservation of Trees Act, 1975 as approved by the State Cabinet, the Local Tree Authorities in the State are advised to follow the following instructions:- (1) The Local Tree Authorities while passing cases at their level shall be subject to the proposed amendments in the Maharashtra (Urban Areas) Protection and Preservation of Trees Act, 1975.
(2) Since the proposed amendments provide for the establishment of the Maharashtra State Tree Authority at the State level, the following proposals falling within the purview of the Maharashtra Tree Authority should be kept ready for submission to them: (a) Proposals for felling of Heritage trees.
(b) Proposals for felling of more than 200 trees of 5 years of age and above.
In this case, it should be ensured that the projects are not divided into small areas to keep the number of trees within the prescribed limits.
