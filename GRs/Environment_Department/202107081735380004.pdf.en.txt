Read: (1) Government Decision, Environment and Climate Change Department No. Mission-2020/ No. 134/ T. Government Decision, Environment and Climate Change Department No. Campaign-2021/ Q. 1, dated October 14, 2020 (2). No.51/ T. Dated the 18th of May 2021
GOVERNMENT DECISIONS:" Majhi Vasundhara Abhiyan," based on the five elements of nature- Earth, Air, Water, Fire and Sky, was implemented in the local bodies of the State from 2nd October, 2020 to 15th April, 2021. A total of 686 schools participated in the competition. These include 43 AMRUT cities, 222 Nagar Parishads, 130 Nagar Panchayats and 291 Gram Panchayats.
Desktop evaluation of the work done by the local bodies in the campaign period from 16 April 2021 to 31 May 2021 was done through a three-tier system. As it was not possible to go to these local bodies in the wake of Corona in the state and evaluate their work, the virtual assessment of the local bodies that came out best in this desktop assessment was done through a committee formed under the department. On the basis of the total score in both these assessments, I have been selected as the winner of the Vasundhara Abhiyan in 4 different categories, as well as the best Divisional Commissioner, the best Collector and the best Chief Executive Officer, Zilla Parishad from the overall performance of the Revenue Department and the district, with the approval of the government. The result has been uploaded on the web portal (www.majhivasundhara.in/) of my Vasundhara Abhiyan on June 5, 2021. The details of the local bodies, divisional and district level officers who have been adjudged as the best in the order of merit in my Vasundhara Abhiyan are as follows:
