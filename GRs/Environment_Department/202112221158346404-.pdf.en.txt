Preamble:" Majhi Vasundhara Abhiyan," based on the five elements of nature- Earth, Air, Water, Fire and Sky, was implemented in the local bodies of the State from 2nd October, 2020 to 15th April, 2021. A total of 686 schools participated in the competition. These included 43 AMRUT cities, 222 Nagar Parishads, 130 Nagar Panchayats and 291 Gram Panchayats.
Desktop evaluation of the work done by the local bodies during my Vasundhara Abhiyan was done. In view of the Corona situation in the state, instead of going to the field to evaluate, a virtual assessment was done of the local bodies that came out best in the desktop assessment. On the basis of the overall score in both these assessments, all the awardees of my Vasundhara Abhiyan, local bodies and officials have been felicitated at the Maaji Vasundhara Abhiyan felicitation ceremony held on World Environment Day i. e., 5 th June, 2021.
My Vasundhara Abhiyan 2.0 was launched on the occasion of World Environment Day.
