Read:- (1) Government Decision, Department of Environment and Climate Change, No. Dated July 23, 2021
(2) Government Decision, Department of Environment and Climate Change, No. Dated December 29, 2021
The Proposal:
The State Electric Vehicle Policy, 2021 has been issued as per the decision of the Government at Reference No. In order to promote the purchase of electric vehicles, various incentives have been announced in this policy. This includes the Early Bird Incentive.
It was also decided that from April 1, 2022, all government, semi-government, local body and government-funded vehicles operating in the country will be battery electric vehicles. In this decision, the condition has been made applicable from 01.01.2022 instead of 01.04.2022 by amending the Government Resolution at Reference No.
Therefore, after January 1, 2022, it has become necessary to purchase and use electric vehicles through all government, semi-government and local bodies and vehicles purchased from government funds.
However, some government officials have to travel extensively for official work. However, the electric vehicles currently available in the market have a limited capacity to run after one battery charge. After this limit is reached, the electric vehicle must be charged. Charging time varies from 3 to 6 hours. Therefore, government officials who have to make frequent trips may have difficulty using electric vehicles.
Therefore, there is a demand to relax this condition for government officials who have to make frequent trips. Considering this demand, the government was considering exempting these officials from the use of electric vehicles.
GOVERNMENT DECISION: Considering the points mentioned in the Preamble, the Government is taking the following decisions: (1) As per the existing policy of the Government, the following Government, semi-Government institutions and local bodies will be required to purchase electric vehicles: 1) All Ministerial Departments, 2) Maharashtra Pollution Control Board,
