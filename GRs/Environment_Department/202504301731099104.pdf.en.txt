Government of Maharashtra
Department of Environment and Climate Change,
Government Decision No: RACK 2025 / P.No.79 / T. A. 9.
Madam Cama Marg, Martyr Rajguru Chowk,
Mantralaya, Mumbai - 400032
Date: 30th April 2025
The Proposal:
Climate change is a serious problem facing the world today and poses serious threats to natural ecosystems, human health, and global economies. The main cause of climate change is the increase in greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere due to human activities. The use of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural AY for energy generation, transportation, industry, and other human activities is responsible for a large amount of carbon dioxide ('02) and other greenhouse gas emissions.
India is committed to a number of international agreements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
This includes the 2015 Paris International Agreement, agreed by 195 countries around the world to limit the Earth's normal temperature by the end of the century. Also according to the Nationally Determined Contributions submitted by India, the country has set a target of net zero carbon emissions by 2070. Under India's Nationally Determined Modified Contributions (NDCs), a target has been set to reduce the carbon footprint of the national gross income (GDP) by 45% by 2030. In addition, a target has been set to generate 50 per cent of the country's total installed power capacity from non-conventional sources by 2030.
3. Caban markets are increasingly being recognized as an important tool among various measures being adopted to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Carbon markets are trading systems in which carbon emission credits are bought and sold, providing financial incentives to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. These markets help determine the cost of carbon pollution, encouraging businesses and countries to adopt cleaner, lower-carbon technologies. In this market, carbon dioxide equivalent (CO?) Equivalent credits are traded, in which one ton of COre is used as the standard unit.
4. All India level carbon credit market came into existence in December, 2022. It is regulated by the National Carbon Trading Policy. The Government of India has laid down the following policies in this regard.

Trading
Carbon Credit Scheme (CCTS) To achieve the goal of reducing carbon emissions, the Government of India has started to develop an integrated carbon market 'Indian Carbon Market' (ICM). It shows an innovative and effective way to reduce emissions through the demand for carbon credits from private and public institutions.
The ICM has been established under the ambit of the Energy Conservation Act, 2001 and the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. Section 14 of the Energy Conservation Act empowers the central government to specify Carbon Credit Trading Schemes (CCTS) in consultation with the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) and issue "Carbon Credit Certificates" to entities registered under different mechanisms.
Accordingly, the Government of India has notified the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS), 2023 under the Energy Conservation (2001) Act on 28 June 2023. Under CCTS, a National Framework has been established with the objective of reducing, eliminating or avoiding greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) in the Indian economy by assessing greenhouse gas emissions through trade in carbon credit certificates.
A National Steering Committee for Monitoring and Operations (NSC-ICM) has been established under CCTS. Union Ministry of Power. It is chaired by the Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. The secretary is the co-chair. The state's The Secretary, Department of Environment and Climate Change is its member. The salient features of CCTS include two mechanisms: compliance mechanism which is for obligated entities and offset mechanism which is for non-obligated entities. The scope of CCTS compliance mechanism includes nine sectors namely Aluminium, Cement, Chlor-Alkali, Fertilizers, Iron & Steel, Pulp & Paper, Petrochemicals, Petroleum Refinery and Textiles. Under the offset mechanism, ten sectors have been approved which include energy, industry, waste handling and disposal, agriculture, forestry, transport, construction, fugitive emissions, solvent use, and carbon capture use and storage.
l. green credit program
Under the Environment Protection Act, 1986, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Government of India has notified 192 Green Credit Rules under the Green Credit Programme on October 2023. These rules have been developed to encourage voluntary plantation across the country. Under these rules, green credits are given for afforestation.
