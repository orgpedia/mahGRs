The Proposal:
The State Government has released the Electric Vehicle Policy, 2021.
In order to promote the purchase of electric vehicles, various incentives have been announced in this policy. This includes the Early Bird Incentive. It has also been decided that from April 1, 2022, all government, semi-government, local body and government-funded vehicles will be battery electric vehicles.
After the announcement of the Electric Vehicle Policy of the State Government, it is being implemented in coordination with various departments and agencies concerned for the implementation of this policy. However, due to some unavoidable reasons, the expected registration could not be done so far. Therefore, the government was considering extending the period of Early Bird Incentives beyond December 31, 2021.
Further, in order to encourage the purchase of electric vehicles, the government was considering a change in the policy as the vehicles purchased from January 2022 to March 2022 through government and semi-government agencies must be battery electric vehicles.
GOVERNMENT DECISIONS: Having regard to the matters stated in the Preamble, the Government hereby take the following decisions: 1. The Government hereby approves the extension of the limit of Early Bird Incentives, contained in paragraph 2.4.1 (b) of the Government Decision dated 23rd July, 2021 up to 31st December, 2021, up to 31st March, 2022.
From January 1, 2022, vehicles purchased through government and semi-government agencies as well as local bodies should be battery electric vehicles.
From April 1, 2022, all vehicles hired for government use will be battery electric.
In accordance with the decisions in paragraphs (2) and (3) above, the Finance Department should take action to make necessary amendments in the Government Vehicle Purchase Policy.
