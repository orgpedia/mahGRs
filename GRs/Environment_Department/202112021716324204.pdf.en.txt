Introduction:
Sand mining operations, although necessary, also result in ecological stress to
the riverine ecosystem. To ensure that this stress is to be kept at a minimum,
sand mining needs to be effectively regulated. Unregulated sand mining has
been a challenge to the regulatory authorities.
The Hon'ble National Green Tribunal, in its recent judgment has identified
destruction of riverine vegetation, riverbank, agriculture field erosion, pollution
of water sources, damage to the ecosystem, deepening of water table, impact on
animal breeding sites, negative impact on revenue and economics by reduction
in tourism, agriculture production etc. as threat to the riverine ecosystem.
In the light of directions passed in the various judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court, and Hon'ble National Green Tribunal, the MoEF&CC issued Sustainable
Sand Mining and Management Guidelines, 2016(SSMG-2016) under the
provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 on 15.01.2016.
Further in the light of the September 2016 report of the High-powered
committee (constituted by the Tribunal), headed by the Secretary, MoEF&CC, the
MoEF&CC issued Enforcement and Monitoring Guidelines for Sand Mining
(EMGSM-2020) on 27.01.2020.

The Hon'ble National Green Tribunal (NGT) (Principal Bench), New Delhi
reviewed the issue of illegal sand mining in the country, its impacts on various
attributes on environment and passed an order with methodology to be adopted
for ecological restoration due to illegal sand mining.
Accordingly, Hon'ble NGT passed an order in O.A no 306/2015 vide dated
26.02.2021, mentioning that ...
"..in the light of discussion in para 12 above, having regard to the totality of the
situation, we accept the report of the CPCB and direct that the scale of
compensation calculated with reference to approach II be adopted by all the
States/UT's.."
CPCB vide letter no CPCB/IPC_II/NGT-OA(360/2015)/2021/2046, dated 11th June
2021 issued directions under section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986
regarding development of mechanism for assessment and recovery of
compensation as per Hon'ble NGT order dated 26.02.2021 in O.A no 360/2015
mentioning that State to evolve an appropriate Mechanism for assessment and
recovery of compensation in all districts of the state and for utilization of the
recovered compensation for restoration of environment by preparing an
appropriate action plan.
The Hon'ble National Green Tribunal in their order dated 26th February 2021
Also directed that, The States/ UTs to strictly follow the SSGM-2016 read with
EMGSM-2020 reinforced by mechanism for preparation of District Survey Reports,
Environmental management Plans, replenishment studies, mine closure plansgrant
of EC etc."
In accordance with the directions issued by the Hon'ble National Green
tribunal, Central Pollution Control Board regarding illegal sand mining the
Government of Maharashtra was in process of formulation of Mechanism for
assessment and recovery of compensation due to illegal Sand Mining. In view of
the above Government has decided to issue the Government Resolution in this
regard as follows.

c) Upon due submission made by the District Collector on the Parivesh
portal of MoEF&CC, the proposal for granting environment clearance is
first heard by State Expert Appraisal Committee (SEAC-1) whereupon if
found in accordance with the various guidelines SEAC-1 recommends the
proposal to the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA).
d) SEIAA, grants EC to the said proposal, if found in order, subject to strict
observance of a set of stipulations so as to ensure that the ecological
stress to the riverine ecosystem is kept at a minimum.
2.2. Duties of District Collector:
a) Some of the important stipulations which are to be ensured by District

para 2 of Hon'ble NGT Order dated 26.02.2021):
a) Enforcement mechanism shall be reviewed by the Chief Secretary once in
three Months.

Control Board (CPCB), Maharashtra State Pollution Control Board (MPCB)
and two expert members of SEAC dealing with the subject.
c) Such inspections must be conducted at least thrice for each lease i.e. after
expiry of 25% the lease period, then after 50% of the period and finally
six months before expiry of the lease period for midway correction and
assessment of damage, if any.

reports may be furnished to MoEF&CC by 30th April every year giving
status till 31st March of the respective year.
2.7. Methodology for Quantification of fine (calculation of
compensation Amount):
With focus on ecological restoration, the fine for incidents involving illegal sand
mining needs to represent the costs to be incurred to restore the ecological
damage caused due to the illegal sand mining activity. Hon'ble NGT has defined
following approach for estimating the amount of fine/ compensation to be
collected by District Collector:
a) In case of calculating the Ecological cost, a simplified Net Present Value
(NPV) shall be computed.
b) In the context of the assessment of ecological damages arising from sand
mining, the NPV is thus considered to be the present value of the current
and future stream of net costs of such activity.
c) The rationale lies in recognising that there may be negative externalities
or ecological damages that result from excessive mining which manifests

itself in a loss of the ecosystem services of rivers, and creates a loss of
well-being for both current and future generations.
d) The extent of damage and the scope for restoration will vary from site to
site and will depend on a variety of biophysical and man-made
characteristics.
