Read: (1) Government Decision, Environment and Climate Change Department No. Mission-2020/ No. 134/ T. C-1, dated 14th October, 2020 (2) My final toolkit of Vasundhara Abhiyan
The Proposal:
Reference No. 1 dated 14th October, 2020 As per the decision of the Government, the" Majhi Vasundhara Abhiyan" based on the five elements of nature- Earth, Air, Water, Fire and Sky- is being implemented in the Urban Local Bodies and Gram Panchayats of the State. Under this campaign, 1500 points have been kept for evaluating the work done by the local bodies and the indicators for this have been published through the toolkit.
The duration of the campaign was fixed as March 31, 2021. However, in view of the Corona situation in the previous year, the period of this campaign was extended till April 15, 2021, so that the local bodies could get an opportunity to work under the Maaji Vasundhara Abhiyan as per the demand of the local bodies.
It was decided to evaluate the work done by the local bodies during the campaign period in two phases as mentioned in the Government Decision and Toolkit dated 14th October, 2020 at Reference No. 1. The first stage is to conduct desktop assessment through a tri-system based on the information on MIS filled on the web portal by the local bodies and in the second stage, the work done by the local bodies who have passed this assessment will be physically examined through a tri-system by visiting the city/ village.

4.Accordingly, the desktop can be assessed. Technogreen Environmental Solution, Pune for field assessment. Moody International (Intertek) has been appointed as the third agency.
Desktop Assessment is being carried out by the designated agency for conducting Desktop Assessment after the expiry of the extended period of the Mission.
Lockdown-like restrictions have been imposed in the entire state due to Corona. These restrictions have been extended till May 31, 2021. Even after this, it seems that with the improvement in the situation, the field assessors of the tri-state system will not be able to go to the local bodies and do field assessment. So, one option is to do online field assessment without actually going to the field.
I am planning to felicitate the best performing local bodies under the Vasundhara Abhiyan on World Environment Day i. e. 5 th June, 2021.
In view of the above situation, after the completion of the desktop assessment of the work done by the local bodies under the Vasundhara Abhiyan, the government was considering to set up a committee under the department to determine the methodology for field assessment of some of the best local bodies in each group (vertical).
