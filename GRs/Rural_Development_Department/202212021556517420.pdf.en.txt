Preamble: The Government has issued a circular regarding the inter-district transfer of Class-3 and Class-4 employees of the Zilla Parishad. The revised policy has been fixed as on 29/09/2011. As per this policy, teachers working under the district council were also being transferred inter-district. However, in view of the large number of teachers and the proposal of inter-district transfer of teachers, which is pending, their inter-district transfer should be considered separately.
The government has taken a decision. The revised policy was fixed on 24/04/2017. After that, the government will take a decision. The revised policy has been decided as per the Government Decision dated 07/04/2021.
As per the policy, inter-district transfers of Zilla Parishad teachers have been made at the state level between 2017 and 2022. As per the provisions of Rule 6 (8) of the Maharashtra Zilla Parishads District Services (Entry into Service) Rules, 1967, the Chief Executive Officer of the concerned Zilla Parishad is the competent authority to appoint Zilla Parishad employees to other Zilla Parishads by inter-district transfer and also to relieve them to join the place of transfer.
However, since the government policy states that the percentage of vacancies in the district must be less than 10% to move out of the district, many Zilla Parishads where the percentage of vacancies of teachers is more than 10%, have transferred teachers.

It has not been released yet. Therefore, the seats in the district councils to which these teachers will go through inter-district transfer remain vacant.

Therefore, it is becoming difficult for such Zila Parishads to ascertain the exact posts lying vacant with them.

Government Decisions: Computerized District Councils from 2017 to 2022
Teachers transferred under the inter-district transfer of teachers should be relieved from all Zila Parishads (including Zilla Parishads where the percentage of vacancies is more than 10%). Accordingly, all the Zilla Parishads should take care to take the following actions: 1) The teachers who have been transferred under the inter-district transfer process of ZP teachers, which was carried out only through computer system between 2017 and 2022, and have not been relieved so far, should be listed according to the transfer year wise and the service level in the existing district.
2) Inter-district transfer of Zilla Parishad teachers, which was first carried out in 2017, in a phased manner, if required for administrative reasons, taking into account their service status in the existing district.
The teachers who were transferred under the process should be relieved. The teachers who were transferred the following year should be relieved.

3) The Chief Executive Officer, Zilla Parishad should personally ensure that such teachers are relieved of their duties taking into account the transfer year and the service level in the existing district.
4) It should be noted that disciplinary action will be proposed against the concerned in case it is found that the transfer year and service period have been waived off.
5) In schools where there are more vacancies of teachers due to the release of such teachers, teachers should be arranged through internal appointments, keeping in view the educational interests of the students. If there are still questions about vacancies, alternative arrangements can be considered.
6) Vacancies of teachers in schools in the state. Sumoto Public Interest Litigation No. 02/2022 has been filed and as per the affidavit filed by the office of the Director of Education (Primary) in the case of this PIL, since the school education department proposes to fill the vacancies of teachers of Zilla Parishads in the state through the holy system, the number of vacancies in your district should be accurately recorded on the holy system.
(7) While registering the vacancies of teachers on the system prepared by the School Education Department in connection with the recruitment of teachers, the Zilla Parishad in which such transferred and relieved teachers are working shall indicate the posts of all such teachers as vacant posts. So that the teachers will be available as per the number of posts approved by the concerned district council.
(8) Also, the Zila Parishads to which such teachers are to be transferred shall indicate the vacancies in respect of such teachers on the assumption that they have been filled up. So that the question of additional teachers in such district councils does not arise.
9) Since the transfer process implemented through the computer system developed by the government since 2017 has led to the transfer of such teachers, it is in order for the working district council to relieve such teachers, as well as to present them to the next district council. Therefore, if any court case arises due to the non-release or non-production of such teachers, the responsibility will be of the concerned district council.
