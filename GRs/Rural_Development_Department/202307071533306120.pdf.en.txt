The Government of Maharashtra
the Rural Development Department
Government Resolution No: Committee-2023/ PR No.222/ Dam-3
Nirman Bhawan, 25 Marzban Path, Fort, Mumbai-400001
Date: July 7, 2023
The Proposal:
Funds are provided under various schemes for the development of rural areas of the state. These development works are implemented through agencies such as Zilla Parishad/ Public Works Department/ Maharashtra Rural Road Development Agency etc. However, since these development works are being implemented through different mechanisms and there is no unified database of sanctioned works under various schemes, administrative difficulties arise. Therefore, a committee was formed to make recommendations to the government for the effective implementation of development works in rural areas.
Government's decision:
The following committees are being constituted to make recommendations to the government for effective implementation of development works by streamlining the implementation of various schemes in rural areas.
