The Proposal: -
Department of Rural Development, Government of India Decision No. Tanda Reforms-2019 / Q.67 / Aastha-5, D. CEO, Zila Parishad to select the work under Sant Sewalal Maharaj Banjara / Laman Tanda Samriddhi Yojana under 23.02.2024 keeping in view the priority and urgency received from the Gram Panchayat.
The committee has been constituted under the chairmanship and there is a provision to appoint 2 representatives of the Banjara / Laman community as non-official members in the said committee. However, since most Zila Parishads had administrators, it was seen necessary to appoint these non-official members from the government level. Taking this into consideration, the committee headed by the CEO, Zilla Parishad, Akola will have non-official members for a period of 3 years.
The government was considering making the appointments at the government level.
The Government's Decisions:
Keeping in view the priority and urgency of the work received from the Gram Panchayat under the Sant Sewalal Maharaj Banjara / Laman Tanda Samriddhi Yojana, 2 representatives of the Banjara / Laman community are being appointed as non-official members in the District Level Committee headed by the CEO, Zila Parishad, Akola for 3 years as follows.
