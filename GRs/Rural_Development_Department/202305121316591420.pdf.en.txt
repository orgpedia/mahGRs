They can't be registered. Often the concerned employees request for amendment in the seniority list at the time of their promotion. Corrigendums have to be issued from time to time to make necessary corrections in the seniority notice as per each such request application received. This also leads to cases of man-made disasters. The seniority list along with the reason should be brought to the notice of all concerned immediately and the certificate of the concerned Chief Executive Officer and Zilla Parishad should be sent to the government.
If the list includes self-financed or non-qualified junior engineers, the proposal to exclude these names should be submitted to the government by the concerned Chief Executive Officer Zila Parishad through the concerned Deputy Commissioner (Establishment) Divisional Commissioner's Office within eight days from the date of publication of the list.
The list has been prepared on the basis of the information provided by the concerned Divisional Commissioner's office to the government. Therefore, if any question arises in the future regarding this list, then the responsibility of the concerned Chief Executive Officer, Zila Parishad and the concerned Deputy Commissioner (Establishment), Divisional Commissioner's Office will be fully responsible.
