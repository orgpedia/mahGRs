(1) Government Resolution No.JIPB-4820/ PR No. 290/ Aastha-14 dated 7.4.2021.
2) Government Resolution No.Anjib-4820/ PR No. 291/ Aastha-14 dated 7.4.2021.
Preamble: The Government has decided to make the transfer of primary teachers in the Zilla Parishad through the online mode. 1& 2 dated 7.4.2021. In this decision, the government has made a provision that the transfer of Zilla Parishad teachers should be done once a year from May 1 to May 31. However, the transfer process in 2019 was completed after May 31. Therefore, the transferred teachers had to report for work after June 15. Therefore, representations have been received from the government that the teachers working in the remote hilly areas of the 2019 transfer process should be corrected as they are not completing the three-year period in that post till May 31, 2022, as there will be injustice in the transfer process in 2022. For this, it was under the consideration of the Government to consider the matter by the end of June 2022 instead of 31st May of the said decision dated 7.4.2021.
Government's decision:
It is hereby approved to consider extension of term of office up to 30th June, 2022 instead of 31st May, 2022 for the transfers to be effected in the year 2022. The term of office will be considered only for the 2022 transfers.
