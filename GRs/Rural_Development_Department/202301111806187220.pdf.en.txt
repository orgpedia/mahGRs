The Proposal:
The Mukhyamantri Gram Sadak Yojana has been launched in the State of Maharashtra under the Government decision dated 28th October, 2015 to connect the unconnected villages and improve the condition of roads in rural areas. Further, to improve the condition of roads in rural areas, the Government of Maharashtra has approved the Mukhyamantri Gram Sadak Yojana Phase-II on 06.01.2022.
Rural roads are a basic requirement to reach villages. The benefits of upgraded roads can be sustained only if rural roads are maintained regularly. Preservation reduces the rate of deterioration of roads and thus preserves the investment made before construction. This ensures that the roads remain serviceable for their entire duration. Accordingly, as per the Government Decision dated 27.08.2019 of the Department of Rural Development, No.2 of the above mentioned scheme, the rural roads preservation policy has been decided
