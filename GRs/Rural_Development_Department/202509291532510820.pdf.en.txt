The Proposal:
Reference No. Under the Government Decision 1, the Smart Village Scheme was introduced by changing the format and criteria of the Environmentally Balanced Prosperous Village Scheme.

(Aba) Patil Sunder Gaon Award Scheme" has been given under the Government Decision of H. 3.
In the Cabinet meeting held at Mantralaya, Mumbai on 1st December, it has been decided to implement "Mukhyamantri Samriddhi Panchayati Raj Abhiyan" in the State to involve people at four levels viz. State, Revenue Department, District and Taluka levels in a voluntary manner so that there is competition at the level of Gram Panchayats, Panchayat Samitis and Zila Parishads functioning as local self-government institutions in rural areas to implement all Central / State Government schemes in a more dynamic manner. Awards will be given to Gram Panchayats, Panchayat Samitis and Zila Parishads at four levels - State, Revenue Department, District and Taluka - based on the performance of Gram Panchayats during the campaign period. Accordingly, Reference No. Government orders have been issued under Section 4.
