Preamble: A State Level Pesa Cell has been set up under the Department of Rural Development for implementation of the Provisions relating to Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996.
The Scheduled Areas in the State are spread over 13 districts and 59 blocks. The Scheduled Areas are being continuously followed up by the concerned offices to discharge the constitutional responsibilities of the Governor.
Mr. President and Mr. The Governor needs a quick response from the implementing agencies to fulfil his constitutional responsibilities towards the Scheduled Areas.
However, the district and taluk-level committees are yet to be formed. In view of this, the matter of declaring PESA nodal officers at the department and district level was under consideration of the government to enable a rapid response mechanism for scheduled areas.
Government Decision: In order to implement the provisions of the Panchayats (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996 effectively in the Scheduled Areas, the Deputy Commissioners (Development) in all the Divisional Commissioner's Offices under the Rural Development Department and Deputy Executive Officers (POs) of the Zila Parishads in the 13 Scheduled Areas are being declared as Nodal Officers (PESA).
