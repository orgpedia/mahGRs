Introduction: Maharashtra State Electricity Corporation has requested to pay the arrears of electricity dues of rural water supply schemes and street lights in the limits of Gram Panchayats and Municipal Councils. The Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) has demanded the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) to pay the pending electricity bills. The Deputy Chief Minister and Ministers of Finance and Planning will preside over the function. The meeting was attended by ministers and officials.
Since the arrears shown by MSEDCL in the said meeting include the arrears of offices other than Gram Panchayats, private individuals, institutions etc., it is not clear as to what is the net arrears of Gram Panchayats and how the amounts paid by this Department from the 14th Finance Commission as well as from the regular grants on account of arrears of Rs.1 crore have been adjusted in the arrears of respective Gram Panchayats.
The meeting decided to constitute a committee under the chairmanship of Mr. Rajesh Kumar, Additional Chief Secretary (Rural Development and Panchayat Raj), Rural Development Department, to determine the amount of arrears by reconciling certain aspects.
Government Decision: To set up a committee to determine the amount of arrears by reconciling the arrears of electricity payments for street lighting and rural water supply schemes in the limits of Gram Panchayats and Municipal Councils
It's approved. The committee will have a three-month-long tenure. The composition of the committee will be as follows:

Committee's mandate:
Electricity bill is due by March 31, 2021. These include offices of gram panchayats, private individuals and other institutions. Therefore, the details of the arrears of electricity bills in the street light dues of the net gram panchayats excluding the said consumers will be submitted to MSEDCL through a committee constituted under the chairmanship of the Chief Executive Officer, Zilla Parishad.
Once the details of the total dues are submitted to the state-level committee by MSEDCL, the committee will determine the electricity bill dues and give instructions to the concerned departments regarding the payment of the final dues.
MSEDCL will ascertain from the details received from MSEDCL as to whether the amount paid by the Government to MSEDCL out of the outstanding electricity bills as on March 31, 2021, from the Finance Commission funds and regular subsidy, has been adjusted in the outstanding bills of street lights and water supply schemes in the Gram Panchayat limits.
3) In future, the Gram Panchayats will submit a proposal/ plan to the Government to ensure that the pending dues of electricity bills for street lights and water supply schemes are not pending and to take concrete measures to pay the bills on time.
4) In order to avoid such instances where consumers other than those covered under street lights and water supply schemes of Gram Panchayats are found to be in arrears of electricity bills shown by MSEDCL, MSEDCL shall take appropriate decision in consultation with MSEDCL for creation of an improved billing system in respect of bills by providing two unique unique IDs for street lights and water supply schemes.
