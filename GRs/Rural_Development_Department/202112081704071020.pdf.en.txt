3) Rural Development Department, Government Circular No. 2021/ No. 24/ Finance, Dated: 15th November, 2021 Government Circular: 100% subsidy is provided by the State Government to meet the expenditure on the electricity payment of street lights on the roads within the limits of the Gram Panchayat. However, there has been a huge increase in the expenditure on electricity bills of street lights for the last few years and the MSEDCL has been repeatedly pursuing with this department as well as the Gram Panchayats to clear the outstanding amount of electricity bills. A large amount of electricity bills are pending.
2) It has been observed that there has been a huge increase in the payment of electricity bills on street lights in the limits of Gram Panchayats for the last few years. It has been observed that the electricity bills are increasing as most of the Gram Panchayats are using high-mast lights on the roads in their limits. As the gram panchayats need to keep the amount of electricity payment under control by reducing and saving on the use of electricity for street lighting, the government was considering to direct the gram panchayats not to install high-mast street lights in their area.
3) Since it is necessary to save and reduce the use of electricity in order to control the amount of electricity payment for street lights on the roads within the limits of gram panchayats,

The government has decided not to install high-mast street lights.
The Chief Executive Officer and the Zilla Parishad should inform the matter to all concerned.
4) The office/ department which has sanctioned and distributed grants to the Zilla Parishad, Panchayat Samiti and Gram Panchayat from various schemes should not approve the installation of high-mast lamps from this grant on the roads within the limits of the Gram Panchayat and the concerned office/ department should give instructions to the Zilla Parishad/ Panchayat Samiti/ Gram Panchayat through separate orders/ circulars.
LED lights should be used to save electricity consumption of street lights in the limits of the Gram Panchayat and considering the prevailing government policy/ decision to make the street lights in the limits of the Gram Panchayat based on solar energy, the scheme should be implemented and the government should approve the scheme in a separate prescribed manner.
