The 73rd Constitutional Amendment to the Constitution of India has laid down the need for decentralization of power, devolution of powers and responsibilities to make the Panchayati Raj Institutions more efficient. Effective decentralization must involve devolution of powers to local bodies, transparency and participatory approach. For that, various sections of the society such as farmers, women, youth, SC/ STs, etc. need to be involved in the entire process.
The Central Executive Committee of the Government of India in its meeting held on 9th October, 2015 at Delhi has given instructions regarding preparation of Gram Panchayat Development Plan. It is necessary to prepare a development plan for every Gram Panchayat to get the funds of the 14th Finance Commission. In this regard, as per the guidelines of the Central Government, Government decisions/ circulars have been issued from time to time to prepare and effectively implement the' Gram Panchayat Development Plan" under the' Our Village, Our Development" initiative.
The constitutional amendment gave constitutional status to the Panchayati Raj institutions and also provided for a uniform administrative structure. Over time, Panchayati Raj Institutions have become stronger and are making significant contributions to village governance and development. They are becoming the identity of rural India, especially the Gram Panchayats are playing an important role in the development of their jurisdiction. The Gram Panchayat Development Plan (GPDP) for the development of their area is being prepared since 2015.
The Ministry of Panchayati Raj has prepared a comprehensive" Guidelines for preparation of Gram Panchayat Development Plan" in the year 2018. The Ministry of Panchayati Raj and Rural Development, Government of India has launched the People's Plan Campaign (PPC) to prepare comprehensive Village Development Plans (GPDPs) for the years 2018 and 2019 under the name of" Sabki Yojana, Sabka Vikas." Such campaigns have significantly improved the quality of village development plans.
The Ministry of Panchayati Raj, in its recommendations to the Fifteenth Finance Commission, had requested for grant-in-aid to Gram Panchayats as well as Block Panchayats and District Panchayats. India on the recommendations of the Fifteenth Finance Commission.

The Government has decided to provide grants to Block Panchayats and District Panchayats for 2020-21. Accordingly, it was thought that there should be comprehensive suggestions for the preparation of Block Panchayat Development Plan (BPDP) and District Panchayat Development Plan (DPDP) for the development of rural areas.
1.2 Constitutional Provisions with respect to Planning at Block and District Level Article 243G of the Constitution of India contains the following provisions:
243G Powers and Responsibilities of Panchayats Subject to the provisions of the Constitution, the Legislature of a State may, by law, confer on Panchayats such powers and authority as may be necessary to enable them to carry on their functions as self-governing bodies, and-
(a) the development of social and economic justice;
(2) to implement the schemes relating to economic development and social justice which may be entrusted to it, including the schemes relating to the matters enumerated in Schedule XI;
The above provisions have been made to empower all the three tiers of these Panchayati Raj Institutions. Accordingly, the State Government may delegate its powers and authority to the Panchayati Raj Institutions. This will facilitate them to plan and implement schemes of economic development, social justice as per the subjects mentioned in the Eleventh Schedule of the Constitution of India. These provisions also include giving powers to Panchayat Raj Institutions to levy taxes and raise funds through them.
Article 243G of the Constitution of India directs the Panchayat Samitis to prepare a Panchayat Samiti Development Plan (BPDP) for economic development and social justice by integrating and converging all the programmes/ schemes being implemented in the area of Central, State and Panchayats. Apart from this, it is also the responsibility of the local administration and panchayat committees to provide basic services to the local citizens and to look after the safety of the poor and marginalized sections of their area. This can be achieved only through the implementation of a comprehensive plan by using the available resources efficiently and responsibly and avoiding duplication of work at different levels.
In the last two and a half decades, the state and central governments have encouraged participatory planning at the panchayat samiti level. However, challenges such as inadequate resources, lack of public participation, etc., continue to hinder the formulation of a comprehensive and visionary Panchayat Samiti Development Plan (BPDP). However, the grants recommended by the 15th Finance Commission and the pro-activeness of the Central Government and the State Governments have given impetus to the preparation of the Panchayat Samiti Development Plan (BPDP) and it is time to prepare the Panchayat Samiti Development Plan in a holistic and inclusive manner.
Preparation of Panchayat Samiti Development Plan is a process to be completed within the stipulated time frame. It is a part of the process of chain planning which is completed step by step. After the Gram Panchayats complete the Gram Panchayat Development Plan (GPDP) in their area, the Panchayat Samiti is required to prepare the Panchayat Samiti Development Plan.
As per Article 243G of the Constitution of India, the District Council Development Plan for economic development and social justice by integrating all such programs/ schemes of the Panchayat, State and Central in the geographical area of the district.

There are instructions for preparation and implementation. In addition, the district panchayat as the local government assumes the responsibility of delivering basic services to the local citizens and ensuring the safety of the poor and marginalized sections of the population. This can only be achieved through the implementation of need-centered plans through efficient and responsible use of available resources and expanding resources to meet their priorities. It is also necessary to take care that the works undertaken by the Gram Panchayat, Panchayat Samiti, ZP and other departments of the state government should not be doubled.
The Panchayat Samiti Development Plan is to be prepared on a long-term basis (for five years), out of which priority is to be fixed for the work to be implemented in one year. The Panchayat Samitis have to take up suitable works for implementation considering the manpower, infrastructure and institutional capacity available with them. Priority should be given to works that will benefit two or more Gram Panchayats.
In the last two and a half decades, the state and central governments have always taken the initiative to encourage participatory planning at the district panchayat level. However, various challenges such as inadequate resources, people's participation, capacity building and the like have impeded the formulation of a comprehensive and visionary District Development Plan (DDP) for rural areas. But now the campaign has got a boost due to the active participation of the Government of India and the State Government through the 15th Finance Commission Grants for District Development Plan. Therefore, it is time to prepare district development plans in a comprehensive manner and enhance their quality with equity and inclusiveness. Moreover, there are various schemes and most of the institutions implemented by the central and state government at the district level. Therefore, there is a huge scope for convergence in planning at the district level. Preparation of District Development Plan for rural areas is a time bound process. After the completion of the GPDP and BPDP, the district planning plan should be prepared by the Gram Panchayat and Panchayat Samiti.
