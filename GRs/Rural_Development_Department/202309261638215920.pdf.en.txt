the current record
8. With regard to the seniority list published earlier by the Government, it has been observed that the said seniority list is not brought to the notice of the concerned. Therefore, the concerned cannot file objections in time. Often the concerned employees request for correction in the seniority list at the time of their promotion. Corrigendums have to be issued from time to time to make necessary corrections in the seniority notice as per each such request application received. This also leads to cases of miscarriage. The seniority list along with the reason should be brought to the notice of all concerned immediately and the certificate for doing so should be sent to the government.
While submitting objections/ objections/ information for the final seniority list, the Government Circular No. GPA-2020/ PR No. 89/ Aastha-4, D. All instructions dated 13th November, 2020 shall be strictly followed.
If the list includes self-financed or non-qualified junior engineers, the proposal to exclude these names should be submitted to the government by the concerned Chief Executive Officer of the Zilla Parishad, through the office of the concerned Deputy Commissioner (Establishment) and Divisional Commissioner within eight days from the date of publication of the list.
