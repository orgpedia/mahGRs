Preamble: As per the Bombay Local Fund Audit Rules, 1930, the audit of local bodies in the state is carried out by the Directorate of Local Fund Audit. The audit report is issued to the concerned agency by filing objections to the financial or other irregularities found during the audit.
Most of the district councils in the state have a large number of pending paragraphs in the local fund audit. Despite continuous follow-up with the District Councils in this regard, the pending paragraphs do not seem to have been resolved very satisfactorily. Many of these paragraphs are pending for trivial reasons and due to non-regulation of disposal of pending paragraphs in the District Councils, a large number of paragraphs remain pending and the number of pending paragraphs increases with the addition of new paragraphs in the current audit report. The government incurs loss by investing government funds in such pending articles.
Government Circular: Objections are regularly raised by the Legislative Committee, Accountant General and Local Fund Accountants regarding the pending paragraphs. This matter is very serious and shows the apathy of the district councils in dealing with the pending paragraphs. Therefore, instructions are being issued for expeditious disposal of the long pending cases (since 1962)
After receiving the audit report in accordance with Section 8 of the Mumbai Local Fund Audit Act, the first compliance report should be submitted to the Local Fund Accounting Department within the prescribed time frame with appropriate documents to correct the defects or outliers pointed out in the report.

GOVERNMENT Circular No. STATION-2023/ PR No.24/ FINANCE-72) With the view that disposal of pending paragraphs is an important mission, all paragraphs should be classified as low, medium and high risk so that pending paragraphs can be disposed of.
3) Compliance of pending paragraphs is not presented in a proper manner by meeting the point contained in the paragraph. Therefore, the paragraphs remain pending due to non-compliance. So while submitting compliance of the paragraphs, they should be submitted in accordance with the issue and properly and all the necessary documents should be submitted along with it for compliance to be accepted.
(4) As per Rule 53, Schedule 20 of the Bombay Finance Rules, 1959, in case of loss of Government funds due to the inexcusable negligence or misappropriation of Government officers/ employees, the person shall be held personally liable for such loss and appropriate corrective and punitive action as per rules shall be proposed against him in accordance with Section 8 of the Bombay Local Fund Audit Act, 1930 (Amendment) Rules, 2011.
5) The officers/ employees should ensure that serious passages do not arise during the office work. Further, the instructions given in the circular of the Department of Rural Development and Water Conservation dated December 11, 2013, as well as the responsibilities and duties assigned to them by the Nodal Officer, should be strictly implemented and the pending paragraphs should be disposed of expeditiously.
6) To reduce the number of pending paragraphs, if necessary, maximum number of paragraphs should be disposed of by organizing department-wise and district council-wise camps.
7) Recovery of arrears from the beneficiaries of development schemes- The beneficiaries of the various development schemes of the government have incurred a huge loss of government funds due to the inclusion of a large amount of government funds in their account recoverable amounts and such recoverable amounts have not yet been recovered. Such pending issues should be resolved immediately.
8) Unrecoverable bad debts- The District Councils had provided loans to the farmers in their area for the purchase of seeds and agricultural implements for agriculture. The loan program was discontinued in 1992. However, due to non-recovery of such loans by the borrowers within the stipulated time, the objections raised in the audit in this regard are still pending.
As per Rule 150, 151,114,152 of the Maharashtra Zilla Parishad and Panchayat Samiti Accounts Act, 1968, administrative and technical approval of the competent authority is required before starting any work. Otherwise objection is raised during audit. Such paragraphs are pending for years due to lack of proper compliance. It will be helpful to resolve such objections if the head of the department of the concerned department of the Zila Parishad/ Panchayat Samiti gives administrative and technical approval to the development works on the basis of the records available with them and certifies that the depositor has put such development works in order.

10) Every year an objection is raised in respect of a subject matter in the audit. For example, in respect of objections such as annual accounts, deposits, advances, budgets, etc., since such objections are raised every year, immediate action should be taken to ensure that such paragraphs are not kept pending for years.
As per Rule 125 of the Maharashtra Civil Services (Retirement) Rules, 1982, the amount due from a government employee should be reported to the Accountant General's office at least two months before his retirement so that orders can be issued for recovery of the amount due from the retirement gratuity paid to him. In addition to the amounts due under Rule 132 of the Maharashtra Civil Services (Retirement) Rules, 1982, within one month from the receipt of the notice of death of a Government servant, the death gratuity payable shall be recovered by determining the amount due from him, if any. Action should be taken as per rules.
12) As the matter of non-availability of documents/ non-disclosure of necessary records for audit is a serious matter, the Panchayat Raj Committee has instructed to take strict action against the concerned. Necessary directions/ instructions have already been issued from time to time through relevant government circulars in the past to prevent such incidents. In case of violation of these instructions, the Chief Executive Officer shall impose a penalty of Rs.100/- (Rupees Two Hundred and Fifty only) under Section 8 of the Bombay Local Fund Audit Act, 1930 (Amendment) Act, 2011. A fine of Rs. 25,000 was imposed on him.
The above instructions should be strictly implemented by all the Zila Parishads and the pending paragraphs should be disposed of as soon as possible by the concerned Head of the Department personally taking care of the disposal. This will help in reducing the number of long pending accounting objections of the Local Fund Accounting Department.
