Government Decision No.: Department of Rural Development, No. Tanda Reforms-2019 / No.67 / Aastha-5,
Dated February 23, 2024.
Preamble: - Department of Rural Development, Government of India Decision No. Tanda Reforms-2019 / Q.67 / Aastha-5, D. Under the 23.02.2024, a committee has been constituted under the chairmanship of CEO, Zila Parishad to select the work to be done under Sant Sewalal Maharaj Banjara / Laman Tanda Samriddhi Yojana keeping in view the priority and urgency received from the Gram Panchayat and there is a provision to appoint 2 representatives of Banjara / Laman Samaj as non-official members in the said committee. However, since most Zila Parishads had administrators, it was seen necessary to appoint these non-official members from the government level. Considering this, the government was considering appointing non-governmental members to the committee headed by the CEO, Zilla Parishad, Raigad for a period of 3 years from the government level.
Government Decision: - Keeping in view the priority and urgency of the work received from the Gram Panchayat under Sant Sewalal Maharaj Banjara / Laman Tanda Samriddhi Yojana, 2 representatives of Banjara / Laman Samaj are being appointed as non-official members in the District Level Committee headed by CEO, Zila Parishad, Raigad for a period of 3 years as follows.
