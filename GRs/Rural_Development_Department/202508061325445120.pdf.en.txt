Preamble: - The United Nations has declared "Global Transformation Programme 2030 for Sustainable Development" and "Leave no one behind" is the core of this global programme.
The United Nations has announced and implemented 17 Sustainable Development Goals and 169 targets / targets under them. It was launched in India on 1 January 2016. The Department of Panchayati Raj, Government of India has adapted the Sustainable Development Goals into a Navratna concept for localization of the Sustainable Development Goals, and various departments of the government are following suit for rural development.
The Panchayati Raj Institutions have a major contribution in the development of rural Maharashtra and the main goal is the overall development of the rural area through the three-tier Panchayati Raj Institutions. Most of the development schemes in the state are implemented through the Panchayati Raj Institutions. Accordingly, Gram Panchayats, Panchayat Samitis and Zila Parishads functioning as local bodies in rural areas need to be incentivised and increased in their efficiency. Various schemes of the Rural Development Department and other departments of the government are implemented by the Zilla Parishad. The Government was contemplating to implement "Mukhyamantri Samriddhi Panchayati Raj Abhiyan" with the theme of effective and speedy implementation of these schemes, taking their benefits to the last mile in rural areas, thereby raising the standard of living of the people in rural areas, creating a mass participation movement in Gram Panchayats, facilitating service delivery to rural citizens, participation of the great saint tradition of Maharashtra, increasing the participation of Gram Panchayats in the core areas of health, education, livelihood, social justice and accelerating the Panchayati Raj institutions.
Government Decision: - In order to encourage and enhance the efficiency of Gram Panchayats functioning primarily as local self-government institutions in rural areas by encouraging them on the basis of their performance, an award campaign "Mukhyamantri Samriddhi Panchayati Raj Abhiyan" is being approved for promotion of Gram Panchayats, Panchayat Samitis and Zila Parishads at Taluka, District, Revenue Division and State level from this financial year.
