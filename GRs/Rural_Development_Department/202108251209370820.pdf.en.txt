The memorial is constructed on the site of Gram Panchayat/ Panchayat Samiti/ Zila Parishad. However, if there is no space available and the heirs/ private land holders agree to give the land for the memorial in the name of the district council, a preliminary inquiry should be conducted and accordingly a self-explanatory proposal should be sent to the government as per rules.
