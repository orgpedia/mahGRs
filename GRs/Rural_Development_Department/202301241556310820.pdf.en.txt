The training
100% subsidy is released to the Centre through the State Governments for 31 Subsidiary Grants (Non-Salary) and 36 Subsidiary Grants (Salary). The Gramsevak Training Centre at Kosbad Hill is run by the Gokhale Education Society.
This training centre has received less than the demand for 36 consecutive months from 2019 to 2022 under the target of Subsidiary Grants (Salaries). During the period, due to receipt of less funds than the demand under the salary target, it has not been possible to clear the pending salaries, allowances arrears etc. of the officers/ staff of the said training centre. The Centre has taken a temporary advance from the institute for payment of arrears of salary during this period and the same needs to be reimbursed. Therefore, there was a frequent demand from the Centre to provide more funds under the salary target. For the year 2021-22, the training centre of Gramsevak Training Centre, Kosbad Hill, G. Palghar, run by Gokhale Education Society, will be established.
36 of this period, the amount falling under the target of Subsidiary Grants (Salaries) is Rs. 2776.00 thousand (Rupees Twenty Seven Lakhs Seventy Six Thousand only) to be provided by the Legislative Council by the year 2022.
