Government circular
The reference No. As per the Government Circular dated 08.12.2021, in order to control the amount of electricity payment for street lights on the roads in the limits of Gram Panchayats and to save and reduce the consumption of electricity, the Government has decided that the street lights should not be installed with high-mast. Before the government decided not to install the highmast, some district councils have given administrative approval to install the highmast and have provided funds for it and the tender process has been started. In such a case, people's representatives and district councils have requested the government to allow the installation of highmasts. The matter was under consideration of the government.
The government has already taken the decision.
Power bills will not be increased in cases where tenders have been issued for the installation of high masts by giving administrative approval before the government took a decision through a circular dated 8.12.2021 regarding the non-installation of high masts on the street lights on the roads in the limits of the Gram Panchayat.
