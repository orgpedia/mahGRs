These institutions have consistently received less than the demand for grants under the target of 36, Subsidiary Grants (Salaries) during the period from 2019 to 2022. Therefore, during this period
Full salary, arrears of allowances and allowances of officers/ staff of the institutions.
Retired employees have not been able to meet the allowable benefits etc. Some of the institutions have incurred expenditure from their own funds/ funds available under other schemes for payment of salary arrears during this period, which needs to be reimbursed.

For this purpose, 11 Panchayat Raj Training Centres will be established during 2019-20 to 2021-22.
