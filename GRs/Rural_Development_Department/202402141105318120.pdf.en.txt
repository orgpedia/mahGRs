Introduction: The Department of Rural Development implements various development schemes related to the people in rural areas.
Some of these schemes are of the state government, while some are implemented as per the policy of the central government.
It is necessary for the public to be aware of these schemes, to create public awareness about the schemes, to have public participation in them and to take into account any suggestions / objections of the public about the schemes and to raise the image of the government through all these. Therefore, it is necessary to give wide publicity to these schemes. However, since there is no separate scheme in the Department of Rural Development for "promotion and publication" of these schemes, the purpose of making these schemes widely public and made known to the public has not been fully achieved. Hence, the government was considering opening a separate head of accounts for the Rural Development Department for the "Advertising and Publicity" programme.
Jhasan Decision: The Government is approving the opening of the following head of accounts for the Rural Development Department to budget the available expenditure for the programme "Advertising and Publicity": -
