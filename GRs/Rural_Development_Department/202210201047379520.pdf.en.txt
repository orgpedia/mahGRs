Introduction: The lowest of the group C scripts in various administrative divisions
Since the level of the chain of promotion to the senior post after appointment to the post is different from the administrative department, there is no equality in getting promoted as a senior officer after appointment. Therefore, the employees of the clerical class should create equal stages of promotion for the clerical cadre.
There was a demand. In response to this demand, the General Administration Department has issued a government circular in the above-mentioned administrative departments under their authority.
In view of the demand to reduce the level of clerical class in the office, the government was considering to form an expert committee to examine and study and submit a report.
GOVERNMENT DECISION In accordance with the above proposal, an expert committee is being constituted to examine and study the reduction in the level of promotion of clerical class employees in the Group-C cadre in the Zila Parishads and submit a report as follows.
