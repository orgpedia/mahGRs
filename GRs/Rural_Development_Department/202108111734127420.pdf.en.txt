The scheme for providing grants for the construction and repair of Zilla Parishad schools in the Rural Development Department is not working. Therefore, the Govt. As per the Government Decision dated 01.07.2021, the responsibility of supervising all the sanctioned constructions like new construction/ maintenance repair works of Zilla Parishad Schools, special repair of Zilla Parishad Schools, protection wall, playground, ramp, kitchen, etc. under all the schemes implemented by the Central and State Governments like District Development Plan (DPDC), Finance Commission, Sports Scheme, Mining, CRC Fund, MP Local Development Programme and MLA Local Development Programme, preparing budgets and completing the constructions with technical approval has been entrusted to the Junior Engineer, Deputy Engineer and Executive Engineer (Samagra) working under Samagra Shiksha. However, considering the number of engineers for the functioning of both the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan and the Zilla Parishad Construction Department, the sanctioned works related to the Zilla Parishad School Durgasti and construction work will be insufficient, after being certified by the Executive Engineer working under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, the Education Officer (Primary) and the Chief Executive Officer,
