The Proposal:
The farmers are being provided loans from nationalised banks, cooperative banks, private banks and credit unions. In this, the farmers are more inclined towards the district central cooperative bank. The loans are disbursed by the cooperative banks through various executive services cooperative societies.
Generally, farmers take new crop loans, medium and long term loans. While taking this loan, he has to collect documents from 7/12 to no-objection certificates of banks, etc. It takes a lot of time and sometimes the season ends. Due to lack of documents, they are not able to get loans on time. As a result, he has to take loans from private lenders at high interest rates. Thus, farmers have to face many difficulties to get loans from banks.
The government was considering to implement the Krishi Karj Mitra scheme by the Agriculture Department of the Zilla Parishad to ensure timely and easy availability of loans to farmers.
Government Decision: In order to provide timely and easy loans to the farmers, the Agriculture Department of the Zilla Parishad is approving the Government's" Krishi Karj Mitra" scheme subject to the following terms and conditions.
Objective of the scheme:
To facilitate easy and hassle-free availability of agricultural credit to farmers and thereby promote development of agriculture sector by increasing capital investment.
Format of the scheme:
Farmers take crop loans during the kharif and rabi seasons. There is a disparity between the area under cultivation and the total crop loan allocation. There is a need to increase investment in the agriculture sector. A closer inspection reveals that the same beneficiaries are taking loans for different purposes. As a result, their agricultural sector is growing. Apart from these farmers, those who want to take a loan, but due to ignorance of the loan process and lack of time, are not able to get a loan.
