For tribal or Tanda areas or if the distance between two villages is more than 3 km, the population must be one thousand.

People's representatives have shown it. In this regard, the following instructions are being issued: The Chief Executive Officers of all the Zilla Parishads should review the Gram Panchayats demanding the division of Gram Panchayats in their district and submit the proposals received at the Zilla Parishad level and meeting the criteria of the Government Decision dated February 12, 2004, to the Government immediately through the Divisional Commissioner. Also, it should be reviewed from time to time at the district level and it should be ensured that such proposals do not remain pending at the district council level. Also, the Divisional Commissioner's office should take care to examine the proposals received from such district councils and submit the complete proposal to the government immediately.
