Government Decision: The contribution of Panchayat Raj institutions in the development of rural Maharashtra is immense. The major schemes of development in the state are implemented through the Panchayati Raj institutions. There is a need to further enhance the efficiency of the Panchayati Raj Institutions by encouraging them according to their performance and creating competition among them for excellent work. For this purpose, the award scheme" Yashwant Panchayat Raj Abhiyan" has been started at the department level and state level from the financial year 2005-2006 for the Zilla Parishads, Panchayat Samitis and Gram Panchayats who have done excellent work in the management and development of Panchayat Raj Institutions in the state.
The government has decided not to include Gram Panchayats in the Yashwant Panchayat Raj Abhiyan from the financial year 2016-17 as the department is implementing a new scheme" Smart Gram Village" for Gram Panchayats in the state. The innovative award scheme" Yashwant Panchayat Raj Abhiyan" has been implemented this year also at two levels- block level and state level, taking into account the evaluation of the work done by the Zila Parishads and Panchayat Samitis in the financial year 2021-22 for their excellent work in Panchayat Raj administration and development. Under this campaign, three best Zila Parishads and three Panchayat Samitis of the state are selected for the award at the state level. Three panchayat samitis are also selected for the award at the block level. At the district and taluk levels,
