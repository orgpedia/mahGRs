It has been recommended to the government to stop the use of funds from the zilla parishad cess fund for the construction of the project.
If additional funds are required for the construction of a Zilla Parishad school room under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, it is necessary to allocate it through public participation. In this case, the additional funds have been sanctioned from the Zilla Parishad Cess Fund without raising funds from the public. Therefore, the funds used from the zilla parishad committee cess fund are the result of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan. Therefore, the matter of preventing the use of funds from the Zilla Parishad Cess Fund for carrying out works sanctioned under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan scheme as per the recommendation of the Panchayat Raj Committee was under the consideration of the Government.

The School Education and Sports Department has fixed the criteria of basic facilities like classrooms, separate toilets for boys and girls, drinking water facilities, retaining wall, playground, ramp, kitchen etc. for all schools in the state. Also, under the Samagra Shiksha/ Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan scheme, basic physical facilities are provided to Zilla Parishad schools.
Under this scheme, the construction and improvement of the Zilla Parishad Primary School building, maintenance and repair works have been included.
The use of funds from the zilla parishad cess fund for the repair and construction of zilla parishad schools sanctioned under the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan scheme is being prohibited.
