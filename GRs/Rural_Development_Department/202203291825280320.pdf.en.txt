Accordingly, the old age list is being revised.
A proposal for inclusion of the following names has been received from the Divisional Commissioner, Pune.
1) Mr. N.H. Chavan, the above name is being included in the seniority list.
""" 4. The final seniority list of District Technical Service Class-III (Agriculture) Cadre Agriculture Officers (M.C.S.) in Zilla Parishad dated 1.1.2018 is being published, assuming that the information is not available from the remaining Divisional Commissioner Offices and their information is"""" Nirank""."""""
5. With regard to the seniority list published earlier by the Government, it has been observed that the said seniority list is not brought to the notice of the concerned. Therefore, the concerned cannot file the objections in time. Often the concerned employees request for amendment in the seniority list at the time of their promotion. Corrigendums have to be issued from time to time to make necessary corrections in the seniority notice as per each such request application received. This also leads to cases of man-made disasters. The seniority list along with the reason should be brought to the notice of all concerned immediately and the certificate for doing so should be sent to the government.
