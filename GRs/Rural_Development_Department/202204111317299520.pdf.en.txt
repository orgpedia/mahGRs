Out of these, 6 Government and 3 Non-Government Gram Sevak Training Centres provide basic training and revision training to Gram Sevaks to enhance the efficiency of Gram Sevaks working in the Panchayati Raj Institutions
The basic training course and revision training course of the Gram Sevaks have been prescribed under reference number 1. The course was established in 2002.
Therefore, the curriculum needs to be changed.

Accordingly, the government was considering revising the basic training curriculum and revision of the training curriculum for the village servants.
