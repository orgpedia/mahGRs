Reference: 1. State Election Commission Letter No.Rania/ M.P.C.-2016/ No.P.No.1/ Office No.5 dated 4th February 2016.
This section is dated February 18, 2016.
3. Gram Panchayat No. 2014/ PR No. 159/ Pt. dated August 4, 2016.
The paper:
The amended provisions have been made in the Maharashtra Gram Panchayat Act, 1958 under the Maharashtra Act No. 4 as approved by the State Legislature.
It is mandatory for candidates contesting elections to local bodies in the state from the reserved category to submit caste certificate at the time of nomination. However, in view of the fact that the candidates are not receiving the caste validity certificate within the prescribed time, and considering the additional workload on the caste verification committees, and in order to ensure that the candidates contesting from the reserved category are not deprived of the elections, the Government from time to time has issued instructions in Section 12-A, 42 (6) (a), 67 (7-A) of the Maharashtra Zilla Parishad and Panchayat Samiti Act, 1961, for the Zilla Parishad and Panchayat Samiti elections and for the Gram Panchayat elections.

Government Resolution No: SANKIRN-2021/ P.No.78/ P.No.2
Section 10-1 A, 30-1 A of the Act, 1958 is amended from time to time to provide for extension of time as required for submission of validity certificate.
2. All the District Collectors, District Collectors and all the Chief Executive Officers of the Zilla Parishads have been informed about the new provisions.
Reference No.3. Under Section 3, formal orders will be issued from the Collector regarding the cancellation of the election of the members elected to the seats required for the backward classes in the elections to the Zilla Parishad and Panchayat Samiti and Gram Panchayats, if they do not submit the caste validity certificate within the prescribed time.
4. Reference No. 2 The Block Development Officer shall submit the names of the members/ Sarpanchs who do not submit the caste validity certificate within the prescribed time to the Collector.
It has been suggested that necessary action should be taken by contacting the State Election Commission regarding the cancellation of the membership/ sarpanch post of these members/ sarpanchs and holding a by-election to the vacant seat there.
Accordingly, the following recommendations are made for further improvement of this procedure. It has been observed that there is a considerable delay in receiving the report when the names of members/ sarpanches who do not submit the caste validity certificate within the prescribed time are submitted to the Collector through the Block Development Officer. The election process of local bodies is completed at the tehsil level and its records are available in the tehsil office. However, in this case, action should be taken to declare the post vacant by receiving a report from the Tahsildar instead of the Block Development Officer. Also, the state election commission should be contacted for the by-election to the vacant post and necessary action should be taken.
(6) In view of the provisions of the Act, in particular, if the caste validity certificate is not produced within the prescribed period from the date of declaration of election, such member shall be disqualified.

Government Resolution No: SANKIRN-2021/ P.No.78/ P.No.2
Since there is a provision that the election shall be deemed to have been cancelled with retrospective effect and such person shall be disqualified to continue as a member, it is decided that formal orders in this regard shall be issued by the Collector as mentioned above.
However, the procedure to be followed in this regard has been decided.
Apparently it is not. Therefore, in the absence of submission of caste validity certificate within the prescribed time period, it appears that the persons elected to the reserved posts are holding the said posts, which is inconsistent with the provisions of the Act. Of course, the Collector should take a suo motu decision and issue orders for disqualification proceedings against all three-tier rural (Gram Panchayat, Panchayat Samiti and Zilla Parishad) members who have not submitted caste validity certificates within the stipulated time. Accordingly, the following procedure is adopted.
If the Gram Panchayat member/ Sarpanch does not submit the caste validity certificate within the prescribed time from the date of election, the Collector shall suo motu/ suo motu take action to disqualify such office bearers as per the provisions of the Maharashtra Gram Panchayat Act, 1959. The Collector should get the necessary report from the Tahsildar or the Sub-Divisional Officer (Revenue) and issue self-explanatory orders accordingly.
In the case of members/ chairpersons of Zila Parishads and Zila Parishads, the Collector shall, after submitting a self-explanatory report to the Divisional Commissioner, issue orders for disqualification of such Panchayat Samiti members/ chairpersons as the case may be, as per the provisions of the Maharashtra Zila Parishads and Panchayat Samitis Act, 1961.
(a) Similarly, the Collector or the Divisional Commissioner shall have a caste certificate issued by any such member/ Sarpanch/ Chairman/ Chairman within the prescribed time.
