Government circular:
Provisional Seniority of Officers in Group-B of Maharashtra Development Service for the period from 1.1.2010 to 31.12.2020. The circular dated 10.02.2021 has been issued. As per the objections/ objections received on this seniority list, appropriate corrections have been made.
On perusal of the objections/ objections to the said seniority list, it is observed that most of the officers promoted by ad-hoc promotion have demanded their date of ad-hoc promotion to Group B as the date of attainment of seniority in the service. However, the merit list has been prepared on the basis of points available in the regular promotion quota of Group B cadre. Officers who have not passed the departmental examination within the prescribed time and within the prescribed opportunity have been deprived of their services. In case of such loss of service, the date of retirement of the said officer has been fixed as on the date of his passing the examination in Group-B or on attaining the age of 45 years as per Government Rules.
