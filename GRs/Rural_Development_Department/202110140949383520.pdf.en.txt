Punitive provisions apply to establishments. If the GST-TDS return is not filed on time, a penalty of Rs 100/- per day, plus interest and penalty on the deducted amount, will have to be paid.
Apart from this, TDS/ TCS on Income Tax, Labour Cess, Royalty and Insurance etc. are also required to be paid within the prescribed time.
There are 34 zilla parishads, 351 panchayat samitis and 27,868 gram panchayats in the state. The 15th Finance Commission has allocated Rs. 29,000 crore over the next five years. Similarly, the Zila Parishads and Panchayat Samitis will also get funds of about Rs 1200 crore every year. Also, about Rs. 268 crore is received by the Gram Panchayats. Various development works are being carried out with this fund. The work of Jal Jeevan Mission has also been taken up on a large scale. There are central government schemes for water supply and sanitation. A large number of works are being done with the funds of the MLAs.
Each Gram Panchayat will be given about Rs. Rs 20 lakh. Further, Rs. 4 lakh has been provided. With this, the total annual revenue of the district is Rs. 10 to 12 lakh. A large number of works are taken up under the schemes like Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, Mukhyamantri Gram Sadak Yojana, RGSA, MSRLM etc.
In each of these institutions, the work done by the contractors under various schemes was paid.
Contractors are required to remit GST TDS on the amount paid and in addition TDS/ TCS on Income Tax, Labour Cess, Royalty and Insurance etc. to the concerned authorities within the stipulated time. Also, it is mandatory to file online returns in accordance with the amount paid. Otherwise, there is a provision to collect penalty from these establishments as mentioned above. The reason for amending the GST Act is that often the government machinery does not take TDS GST Credit and some contractors may not collect GST from the government establishment but do not deposit it with the government. In order to curb this trend, the GST law has been amended and it has been made mandatory to pay TDS and return within a certain time. Since the online returns are not paid within the prescribed time, they are often issued notices by the concerned agencies, collecting a penalty and also paying interest. As a result, local bodies are suffering financial losses.

In the absence of trained manpower to file financial data at the village level, timely filing of returns is not possible. A large number of posts of Gram Sevaks are lying vacant. One Gram Sevak has been given charge of two to three Gram Panchayats. In such a situation, the village servant is not able to pay enough attention. Hence, if the returns are not filed within the stipulated time, the Gram Panchayat has to bear the penalty. Non-deduction of TDS, improper deduction, non-payment of dues on time all lead to penalty and interest charges. The financial loss due to this penalty is directly borne by the Gram Panchayat and other establishments. To get rid of these punitive actions and to do all these transactions in a simple and easy way, it is imperative to set up an efficient and proper system/ system.
These jobs are often done by Chartered Accountants (CAs) or similar professionals for a hefty fee. Therefore, in order to bring uniformity in the functioning of Gram Panchayats, Panchayat Samitis and Zila Parishads as well as other offices under the Rural Development Department such as Maharashtra State Rural Livelihood Mission (MSRLM), Rashtriya Gram Swarajya Abhiyan (RGSA), data entry of all these works by an empowered service provider to avoid unnecessary financial loss may be done through tender process.
Jyostute Management Pvt. Ltd., Pune has been selected as the service provider and the Government Resolution No.2420/ p. No. 19/ Asak, dated March 10, 2021 was issued. The organisation was assigned various tasks like filing GST returns, responding to objections from the GST or Income Tax Department, creating a helpdesk for the employee, providing guidance on tax and deductions, keeping a record of the entire transaction through software, providing full-time experienced and expert assistants for the gram panchayat, providing MIS dashboards to various level officers, etc.
During the review of this work by the Additional Chief Secretary, Rural Development, on July 12, 2021, along with all the CEOs and Zila Parishads, it was observed that many Zila Parishads do this work by their own employees or the work is being done at a low cost at the local level. After a detailed discussion with the CEOs, it was decided to make it voluntary to work in offices other than the Gram Panchayat by the organization selected by the government through the tender process. The government has also made a decision. As of September 6, 2021, Gram Panchayats were also made voluntary to work from the said institution.
In this regard, Ma. The Minister of Rural Development, on 13th September, 2021, Smt. The plan was reviewed with the Additional Chief Secretary, Rural Development, but after the government took a decision, the government decided to implement it.

However, no response had been received from the district administration in this regard. In fact, the government had provided trained manpower to the gram panchayats to file returns of GST or similar taxes. But if the gram panchayats are not willing to work from this institution, then it is not right to force them, so the matter of reconsidering the decision taken by the government in this regard was under consideration.

Ltd. through tender process for payment of GST TDS, TDS/ TCS on Income Tax, Labour Cess, Royalty and Insurance etc. deductions/ returns in Gram Panchayats, Panchayat Samitis and Zilla Parishads and other government offices under this department in the state is being cancelled.
