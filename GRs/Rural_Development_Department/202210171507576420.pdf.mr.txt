Government Circular No.: PMGSY-2022/C.R.200/Works-2 Bandhkam Bhavan, 25 Marzban Road, Fort,
Mumbai-400 001
Date: 17th October, 2022
Introduction :
Maharashtra Rural Development Agency under Rural Development
Department, Government of Maharashtra is executing ambitious schems like
Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana & Mukhyamantri Gram Sadak Yojana for
improvements of rural roads in state. In which construction of roads and minor /
major bridges is undertaken on Village Roads & other District roads, taken under
these schemes.
The bridges dealt with, are generally High level submersible or submersible
type clearing ordinary flood levels. The Approaches for bridges are to be designed
with submersible treatments and upstream & downstream aprons are to be
provided to protect beds in case of bridges with raft foundations. However due to
non-execution of Approaches with requisite treatments and standard specifications
and non-provision of bed protections in case of bridges with raft foundations or
due to unexpected sudden rise in flood levels, the approaches of submersible
bridges gets damaged and river beds gets eroded, resulting in stoppage of traffic
and damage to foundations. In view of this committee headed by Superintending
Engineer, PMGSY, Nagpur was set up vide Govt. Order No. GSY-2022/CR
200/Bandhkam-2, Mantralay, Dt.04/08/2022 to study & suggest provisions to be
made in bridge estimates & to suggest remedial measures to prevent damages to

approaches of submersible Bridges and erosion of river beds near foundations &
damages to foundations of bridges. Various IRC codes and guidelines provides for
provisions to be made in design and constructions of submersible bridges and
approaches. The issue of making these guidelines available in concise form was
under in considerations. Hence based on report and recommendations of
committee, the detailed guidelines for preparations of DPR for submersible bridge
and approaches is being issued as below.
Government Circular:
1.0 Definitions
1.1 High Level Submersible Bridges:- When RTL of the bridge is fixed with
reference to OFL and standard vertical clearance as such structure serves as high
level bridge during OFL but gets submerged under higher flood with maximum 6
interruption of 6 to 12 hours per year then the bridge is called as high level
submersible bridge.
1.2 Low Level Submersible Bridge:- When soffit of deck slab of bridge is fixed
just above OFL so as to insure that the interruptions caused to traffic remain within
permissible limit as mentioned in 1.1 above, is called as low level submersible
bridge.
1.3 Causeways :
A Causeway is a paved submersible structure with or without openings (vents)
which allows flood to pass through and / or over it.
1.4 Flush causeway :
The causeway which is also called paved dip or road dam, the top level of
road is kept same as that of bed level of the channel is called as flush causeway. It
is suitable where the crossing remain dry for most of part of year i.e. the stream is
not perennial. Flush causeways are not suitable for crossing the streams with steep
# Page 3
Government Circular No.: PMGSY-2022/C.R.200/Works-2
bed slopes causing high velocity even in low floods. The causeway covers the full
width of the channel. Refer Fig (1)
1.5 Vented Causeways :
A Causeway provided with vents to permit normal flow of the stream to pass
under the causeway is known as vented causeway. Vented causeways are classified
as low vented causeways and high vented causeways.
1.5.1 Low vented causeway :
Low vented causeways are provided to cross quasi-perennial streams having
sandy beds in areas with annual rainfall less than 1000 mm and where the
carriageway of a flush causeway would be liable to get slushy due to post monsoon
flow in the stream. The height is generally less than 1.20 m above the bed. In
exceptional cases, the height may be 1.50 m above the bed level. Small size of
vents in the form of hume pipes, short span slab / RCC Box Cells are provided in
the width of stream. The sill level of vents is kept about 150 mm – 300 mm below
the average bed level of the stream. Refer fig. (2)
1.5.2 High vented causeway :
High vented causeway is provided when a road crosses a stream having one
or more of the following characteristics:
i. Sizeable catchment area with annual rainfall more than
1000 mm,
ii. Depth of post monsoon flow is more than 900 mm
iii. Flow is perennial but not large
The height of the causeways above the bed shall be kept between 1.5 m to
3.0 m and larger size of vents comprising of hume pipes or simply supported /
continuous R.C.C. slab superstructure over a series of short masonry piers or series
of arches or boxes with individual spans less than 3.00 m are adopted. Refer fig (3)
# Page 4
Government Circular No.: PMGSY-2022/C.R.200/Works-2
2.0 Criteria for avoiding / selection of submersible structures
Submersible structures may not be considered for adoption in the
following situations
a) Roads of economic importance, roads linking important towns or
industrial areas or areas with population more than 10,000 where
alternative all weather route with reasonable length of detour is not
available.
b) On roads which are likely to be upgraded or included, from future
traffic considerations, in the National Highway network.
c) If the length of a high level bridge at such crossings would be less
than 30 m except where construction of high level structure is not
economically viable.
d) Maximum mean velocity of stream during floods is more than 6
m/sec.
e) If the cost of submersible bridge with its approaches is estimated to be
more than approximately 70% of the cost of high level bridge with its
approaches, near about the same site.
f) If the height of embankment for submersible portion of approaches is
more than 2 m.
g) Where there are faults in the river bed.
h) If after completion of the submersible structures, the number of
interruptions in a year caused to traffic and duration of the
interruptions are likely to exceed the suggested values given in IRC.
3.00 Requirements of various components parameters in design of
submersible bridges and their protection works.
3.1 Approach Road of submersible bridge / causeway :
# Page 5
Government Circular No.: PMGSY-2022/C.R.200/Works-2
The approaches on either side of a submersible bridges should have a
minimum straight & level length of 15 m and should be suitably increased, where
necessary, to provide for the minimum sight distance for a vehicular speed of 35
km/h. Horizontal curves in immediate approach roads for a length of about 100 m
on either side of a submersible structure or causeways should be generally avoided.
3.2 Design Speed :
From consideration of safety of road users, lower design speed than that
recommended in IRC: 73 should be adopted for the immediate approaches to a
submersible bridge or causeway. The informatory boards installed on approaches
should indicate permissible speed of 35 km/h in case of plain and rolling terrain
and 20 km/h in case of mountainous and steep terrain irrespective of any higher
speed adopted in the design of the road.
3.3 Camber / Crossfall :
The camber/crossfall on straight sections of immediate approaches and on
submersible structure should be unidirectional towards the downstream and as
recommended in following Table, depending on type of surface of pavement.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|  | Sr.No. |  |  | Surface Type |  |  | Unidirectional Cross fall (%) |  |
| 1 | For all categories of roads High Type bituminous surfacing or cement concrete | 2.0 |
| 2 | Thin bituminous surfacing for approaches | 2.5 |
| 3 | Brick/stone set pavement | 3.0 |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shoulders of approach roads likely to be submerged during floods should be
paved to same cross fall towards downstream as for pavement.
3.4 Gradients:
As a general rule, values of ruling gradients specified in IRC:73 should be
adopted. However, in case of immediate approaches to submersible structure,
# Page 6
Government Circular No.: PMGSY-2022/C.R.200/Works-2
carrying substantial slow traffic, flatter gradients than ruling values should be
preferred. Nevertheless, gradients in immediate approaches unless, otherwise
permitted by user authority, should not exceed 5% (1 in 20) Limiting gradient,
irrespective of nature of terrain.
3.5 Sourcer shape/ trapezoidal longitudinal section of Bridge & Approaches:
3.5.1 Need of trapezoidal L-Section:
Afflux is more in case of submersible bridge than that of high level bridge.
Further high afflux increases velocity which causes high moments on pier
foundations. In order that excessive afflux and thereby hypercritical velocity are
not created, the deck level of submersible bridge should be kept low. The bed
erosion and afflux are interlinked. Thus higher Afflux will create more velocity
obstruction, leading to bed erosion and damage to approach. The percentage of
obstructions to the flood discharge is maximum when the flood rises just up to the
top level of the submersible bridge. This condition causes erosion of banks and
subsequent outflanking. Therefore, deciding RTL is one of the critical conditions
for the design of submersible bridge. Trapezoidal / Sourcer shaped longitudinal
sections of bridge and approaches are considered as hydraulically efficient safest
longitudinal section. Hence to minimize % obstruction and spread of floods,
maximum flow (@HFL) shall be allowed over the trapezoidal / saurcer shaped
longitudinal section of bridge/causeway deck and approaches sloping towards
bridge/causeways.
3.5.2- Design for trapezoidal L-Section and its provisions:
This can be achieved by providing Trapezoidal / longitudinal shape of Saurcer
Shaped Bridge with approaches. Thus RTL of the Submersible Bridge shall be
judiciously decided so that flood discharge of OFL shall clearly pass through vents
of bridge. In case of high floods excess discharge is allowed to flow over
# Page 7
Government Circular No.: PMGSY-2022/C.R.200/Works-2
trapezoidal L-section with permissible limit of time & occurrence of flood. The
approaches upto HFL shall be designed as submersible approaches, So that there
will not be failure during high floods. The trapezoidal L-Section shall be provided
by providing gradient of 1:20 to 1:30 on both side approaches. Slope shall be
started beyond 15 meters from approach slab of bridge with introduction of well
designed vertical curves in approaches. Refer fig (4)
3.6 Formation of Trapezoidal L-Sections in Approaches in cutting and
protective measures to be provided:
The approach roads to Submersible Bridge should preferably be in cutting
with the approach gradient not steeper than 1 in 20. The sloping portions of the
approach should merge into level portion of the bridge in the arc of a properly
designed vertical curves in order to eliminate bumping. It is preferable to have the
approach in cutting as the embankments are liable to be washed away during
floods. In cutting, however, there may be the problem of silting but the same can
be appreciably reduced if the approaches are aligned at a slight angle to the centre
line of the bridge so that the gradient falls in the direction of the river flow. The
approaches in cutting would get submerged for a considerable period therefore
these should be provided with safe side slopes considering the submerged
condition. Further, deep cutting (say more than 4 m) should invariably be avoided.
Wherever steep side slopes are provided for the approaches in cutting, it is
experienced that, the slopes slip over the road pavement and it becomes a recurring
problem to clear it, after every flood. The values of safe side slopes for the
different types of soil under submerged condition are given in table below.
----------------------------------------
|  | Type of Soil |  |  | Vertical |  |  | Horizontal |  |
| Soft Soil | 1: | 2½ |
----------------------------------------
# Page 8
Government Circular No.: PMGSY-2022/C.R.200/Works-2
----------------------------------------
|  | Type of Soil |  |  | Vertical |  |  | Horizontal |  |
| B.C. Soil | 1: | 2 |
| Soft Murum | 1: | 1½ |
| Hard Murum | 1: | 1 |
----------------------------------------
The sides of cutting of Approaches should be protected by stone pitching up
to at least 1 m above the Affluxes HFL. This would avoid souring of sides of
cutting & consequent silting of Approaches. (Refer Fig.5 & 6 for pitching)
Lined drains on either side along the side slopes should be provided. The
lining may be either stone or brick or concrete. The Lined drains should meet the
stream proper at least 10 m away from the edge of the main bridge junction as the
flow of water in the drains would erode the banks for certain length in course of
time. (Refer Fig.7 for drum alignment) In case of straight return walls, minimum 3
m long walls perpendicular to the return walls should be provided to avoid
undermining of foundations of return wall or/and abutments. In case of
submersible bridges founded on sandy beds, extraction of sand/soft material
beyond apron and curtain wall should not be done as this may endanger the safety
of the structure. Fig (7) for lined drains.
3.7 Pavement for submersible approaches :
Length of approaches up to the spread of affluxed highest flood is subjected to
repeated inundation and is always prone to outflanking. Therefore the roadway
should be paved in a similar manner to that of the main Submersible Bridge i.e. full
width bituminous treatment shall be provided in approaches. The paved approach
roadway in cutting needs to be confined between anchor-walls. Refer Fig (8) & (9)
# Page 9
Government Circular No.: PMGSY-2022/C.R.200/Works-2
3.8 Construction methods and provisions to be made for submerging
approaches in Embankment :
When the submerged approaches are in embankments then the possibility
failure of approaches is like approaches cutting D/s side outflanking, washout of
embankments, surface erosion etc.
To prevent such failure following precautions needs to be taken, while
constructing the approaches.
i. Additional vents in form of pipes or box culverts shall be provided on both
side approaches for quick draining / recession of flood water to downstream
side. It helps in quick recession of flood waters of upstream side fields and
minimize damages to crops standing in fields.
ii. Material used for embankments construction shall have CBR value more
than 5%
iii. Layered compactions with maximum thickness of 150mm, at OMC shall be
ascertained.
iv. Side slopes shall be protected by providing stone pitching with pointing.
V. Kerb stones at the edge of pavement of approach shall be provided to
confine the pavement material.
vi. The edge kerb stone facing flow at upstream & downstream shall be rounded
so as to act as hydraulically efficient edge.
vii. If it becomes necessary to provide the approaches in embankment then
proper protection of approaches is to be done with stone pitching & toe wall. Also
Full width of the roadway of approaches likely to be submerged should be paved.
Refer fig (10) to (13) for cross-section of Approaches in Embankment for different
Terrains & ground profiles.
4.0 Requirement of other Protection Work in submersible bridges:
4.1 RCC stopper shall be provided on D/S of pier cap of submersible bridge.
# Page 10
Government Circular No.: PMGSY-2022/C.R.200/Works-2
4.2 Collapsible:- steel Pipe & Angle railing is recommended for submersible
bridge.
4.3: The floor protection should be properly designed as per the detailed
guidelines contained in IRC : 89. The rigid flooring under the structure should
extend for a distance of at least 3m on upstream side and 5m on downstream side
of the structure. (Refer Fig 14)
However if splayed wing walls are provided, the flooring should extend up
to the line connecting the end of the wing walls on either side of the structure. The
top of the flooring should be kept 600mm below the lowest bed level to prevent the
flooring from acting as a weir. It is essential that the work of bed protection is
simultaneously completed along with the work of the foundations of structure to
prevent any damage to the foundations. No stone weighing less than 40 kg should
be used in apron. Where required size stones are not economically available
Cement Concrete block (M-15 grade) or stones in wire crates or cement concrete
blocks and stones in combination may be used in place of isolated stones of
equivalent weight. Cement concrete blocks should however, be preferred wherever
possible.
4.4 Bed Protection or Floor Protection for Shallow Foundations :
In case of submersible structures, where adoption of shallow foundations
becomes economical by restricting the scour, bed (floor) protection to the
structures has to be provided. The bed / floor protection consists of the following
components:
• Upstream and Downstream flexible apron with a slope of 1:8
• Upstream and Downstream cut-off wall. Cut-off Wall shall be at least
300 m below maximum scour level.
4.5 Bed protection or floor protection not required for deep foundations or open
foundations in shallow rock strata -
# Page 11
Government Circular No.: PMGSY-2022/C.R.200/Works-2
wherever deep foundations like well & end bearing pile foundations resting in
hard rock strata and hard non-erodible beds are existing, bed protection works are
not required to be provided.
4.6:- Debris Arrester:
During monsoon particularly during the first couple of rains a lot of debris is
carried by floods. This debris gets obstructed by the piers and the superstructure.
This causes damages to structure and obstruction to flow of water. The
phenomenon is more pronounced in the case of bridges in forest areas when the
floods carry a lot of trees and branches. This situation can be quite dangerous for
smaller spans. Generally the banks get out flanged if the structure is strong enough
to withstand water current forces. It is, therefore, desirable to resort to spans of
minimum 8m or so. This will allow a lot of debris to pass through the bridge. If
the spans are smaller in comparison to the size of debris, debris arresters should be
provided about 50m on up stream of the bridge site so that there is free flow of
floodwater through the bridge. The different types of Debris Arresters/guiders to
be used are shown in photos. The debris Arresters may be circular steel pipe 50m
on u/s bridge or sloping wall at pier location to arrest debris. Refer Photo's(1)&(2)
5.0 Maintenance of existing bridges, causeways approaches and strengthening
of existing beds and submersible approaches wherever required
5.1 If failure approaches is found due to blocking of flow by debris and tree
branches then debris arrester shall be provided at 50 m towards the U/S of bridge.
5.2 Timely clearing at arrester side shall be ensured before onset of monsoon.
5.3 wherever waterways are blocked due to debris or silting, then desilting and
debris removal shall be carried out and waterways shall be cleared in all C.D.
works & bridges before onset of every monsoon.
# Page 12
Government Circular No.: PMGSY-2022/C.R.200/Works-2
5.4 If failure of high bank approach is found then provision of pipes in approach
should be thought in order to minimize water pressure and for quick draining of
stranded water from upstream fields of submersible approaches.
5.5 Adequate Toe wall /Breast wall with pitching shall be constructed towards
D/S of approach as per the stranded designs & drawings enclosed herewith.
5.6 If possible D/S nallah shall be trained in the shape of approaches so that there
will be easy flow of flood water.
5.7 Pre monsoon & post monsoon inspection of bridges and approaches shall be
done and required repairs, strengthening shall be carried before onset of monsoon.
These are the guidelines are based on prevailing IRC & SP Codes mentioned
above. However the amendments to related IRC codes shall be deemed to be
applicable to these guidelines.
