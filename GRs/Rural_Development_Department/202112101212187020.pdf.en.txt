As per the letter of the Ministry of Finance, Government of India and Ministry of Panchayati Raj, Government of India, it has been informed that the disbursement of grants received under the Central Finance Commission is to be done at all three levels of rural local bodies without any deduction within 10 working days from the date of receipt of the grant. The amount should be transferred directly to the savings bank account of the rural local bodies in the state instead of keeping it in the PD/ Personal Deposit or Treasury account.
As per the guidelines of the Central Government, the interest amount deposited in the bank account on the funds of the Central Finance Commission should be used by the rural local bodies only for the activities and related matters for which subsidy has been provided as per the guidelines issued by the Central Government and the State Government. The amount of interest shall be paid at any level other than the concerned Rural Local Body (Panchayat Samiti/ Zila Parishad/ State Government/ Central Government).
