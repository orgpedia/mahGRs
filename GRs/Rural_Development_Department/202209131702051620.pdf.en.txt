As per the provisions of the Government Circular No. GPA-2020/ PR No. 89/ Aastha-4/ dated 13th November, 2020 of the Rural Development Department, the proposals received for the change/ correction in the seniority list and inclusion of names have been considered only after examining the office of the Divisional Commissioner.
Proposals received directly from the Sub Divisional Engineer/ Executive Engineer, Rural Water Supply/ CEO to the Government have not been considered. Also, the names of the promoted, retired and voluntary employees have been excluded.
9. With regard to the seniority list published earlier by the Government, it has been observed that the said seniority list is not brought to the notice of the concerned. Therefore, the concerned should file objections in time.

Government Circular No: GPA-2022/ PR No. 189/ Aastha-4 is not forthcoming. Often the concerned employees request for amendment in the seniority list at the time of their promotion. Corrigendums have to be issued from time to time to make necessary corrections in the seniority notice as per each such request application received. This also leads to cases of man-made disasters. The seniority list along with the reason should be brought to the notice of all concerned immediately and the certificate for doing so should be sent to the government.
The seniority has been prepared on the basis of the information submitted to the government by the Chief Executive Officer, Zila Parishad and the Deputy Commissioner (Establishment), Divisional Commissioner's Office after examining and approving. Therefore, if any question arises in the future regarding this seniority, the concerned Chief Executive Officer, District Council and the concerned Deputy Commissioner (Establishment), Divisional Commissioner's Office will be responsible for it.
