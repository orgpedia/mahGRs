Government circular
In the wake of Corona virus outbreak, as per the advertisement of March, 2019 in the Group-C cadre of Zila Parishad under the Rural Development Department, vacancies in 5 cadres of Health Worker, Health Worker, Laboratory Technician, Drug Manufacturer and Health Supervisor belonging to the Health Department have been filled. 1 Government Decision dated 14th June, 2021 and Reference No. The Government Grants-in-Aid dated 22.6.2021 have been issued. Accordingly, instructions have been issued vide letters dated 15.6.2021 and 25.6.2021 to implement the examination process.
2. The General Administration Department has issued a Government Order dated 23.12.2020 to provide the benefit of Economically Weaker Section in the open category to the Socially and Educationally Backward (SEBC) category. Therefore, the conversion of seats in the Socially and Educationally Backward (SEBC) category into non-local category is leading to a change in the parallel reservation in the open category in the advertisement of March, 2019. Also, there is a change in category-wise/ parallel reservation-wise seats due to the increase in the proportion of compassionate appointments from 10% to 20% for a certain period and due to the compassionate recruitment process followed by the Zila Parishad and other reasons. The recruitment process will have to be carried out as per the changes. This will take some more time.
Therefore, as per the schedule mentioned in the return B along with the Government decision dated 14.6.2021, the District Council-wise advertisement, the advertisement for the newly included category of Divyangs will be published and the candidates will be given the opportunity to apply from July 1, 2021 to May 1, 2021. Trust Communication Pvt. Ltd. Registration/ re-registration will not be possible on the website mahardzp. com. Therefore, it will not be possible to implement the examination as per the schedule as mentioned in the Statement-B of the Government Decision dated 14.6.2021.

3. In view of the above facts, since it is not possible as per schedule to issue advertisement for newly included category of Divyangjans and newly increased category due to change in Parallel Reservation by all the Zila Parishads as mentioned in the Statement-B of the Government Decision dated 14.6.2021, the proceedings in this regard are being deferred. The revised schedule will be notified soon by the government by making changes in the schedule of the examination mentioned in the prospectus-B along with the government decision.
