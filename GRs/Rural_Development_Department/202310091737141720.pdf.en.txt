Government circular:
The Rural Development Department is in the process of publishing the consolidated State Level Seniority List of Junior Engineers in the District Technical Service Class-3 (Electrical and Mechanical) Cadre. Accordingly, Reference No. According to 1. The Provisional Seniority List dated 01.01.2020 to 01.01.2022 was published and objections/ information were invited for finalization of the said list. However, no objection has been received from any of the Divisional Commissioner's office even after the prescribed period. Therefore, the objections/ information of the said offices are presumed to be baseless. The final seniority list for the period 01.01.2020 to 01.01.2022 is being published.
The names of junior engineers who have retired in accordance with the prescribed age have been excluded in this seniority.
3. With regard to the seniority list published earlier by the Government, it has been observed that the said seniority list is not brought to the notice of the concerned. Therefore, the concerned cannot file objections in time. Often the concerned employees request for correction in the seniority list at the time of their promotion. Corrigendums have to be issued from time to time to make necessary corrections in the seniority notice as per each such request application received. This also leads to cases of miscarriage. The seniority list along with the reason should be brought to the notice of all concerned immediately and the certificate of the concerned Chief Executive Officer and Zilla Parishad should be sent to the government.
4. In case of inclusion of self-financed or non-qualified junior engineers in the list, the proposal to exclude such names shall be made by the concerned Chief Executive Officer, Zila Parishad, through the office of the concerned Deputy Commissioner (Establishment), Divisional Commissioner, after the list is published.
