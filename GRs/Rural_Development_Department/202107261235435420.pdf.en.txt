2. Questions/ disputes arise regarding advance increment of awardee teachers in Zila Parishad.
In this regard, it has been observed that the above type of problems occur frequently in the case of employees belonging to the same category. Questions like these. the High Court and m.
The Supreme Court is brought before both such courts for adjudication from time to time. In particular
It has been observed in the cases in the Bombay High Court that many such issues/ disputes
At the same time ma. They are also produced before the Nagpur and Aurangabad benches of the High Court for consideration.
In such court cases, the public prosecutor appointed to represent the government and alternatively the officials of the Rural Development Department are usually not the same.
It has been observed that there is a lack of coordination among the officers of the department who often give instructions to the public prosecutors and as a result, the public prosecutors on behalf of the government do not take such steps.
In court cases. There is a huge discrepancy in the presentation made before the court. This is due to lack of coordination and communication.

(5) All these and such other circumstances shall result in the prosecution by these employees of the Court.
The procedure is followed and not only the employee, but also the government is indispensable for this.
Apart from the financial burden, other problems have to be faced seriously. In addition, it is unnecessary and
Unforeseen court cases/ cases arise and it is entirely up to the court process.
The opposite effect is observed.
In view of the above background, Mr. The High Court of Bombay, in Writ Petition No. 4511/2019
and other writ petitions dated 1.4.2021 are ordered as follows:
"Once the position of law is laid down by this Court and if the State
does not challenge the view taken, there is no reason why the State
Government should not issue clarificatory instructions to its officers to bring
the position in consonance with the law laid down. That not being done, the
Education Authorities keep passing the same orders, which are then
challenged in writ petitions which simply annex the impugned order and the
orders already passed by this Court and such impugned orders are then set
aside following the earlier decisions. Countless petitions keep getting filed on
the same subject by the teaching and non-teaching staff with the same result
and we are informed that the number at the Principal Seat and the Benches
as Nagpur and Aurangabad of such petitions would cross four digits. This is a
creation of needless litigation. The teaching and non-teaching staff are forced
to come to the Court, spending money and time. Time is also important as the
petitioners can invest the same in imparting education for which grants are
paid by the State. The money spent on defending such petitions, and, thus,
the resultant position is of enormous social and economic costs. Apart from
adding to the already crowded docket of this court".
7. In view of the above observation and other points of view on the subject. Advocate General high
The Court may establish Study Groups to study the above issues along with other related and relevant matters.

It is assured that in-depth studies will be conducted on the issues. The Study Group to be set up in this manner shall take appropriate initiatives to resolve the issues/ issues of dispute arising among the employees and resolve the judicial matters pending before the Court.
For topics Avoiding going to court is expected. The above proposed Study Group is expected to give appropriate suggestions for resolution of issues/ issues of dispute and also provide appropriate guidance to ensure that there are no unnecessary and unreasonable litigations before the Court, especially at the outset.
As mentioned above, the matter of setting up the study group was under consideration of the Government.
Government's decision:
Common points of dispute arising between the employees on the one hand and their employers or the concerned Government machinery on the other hand; so that the Court may have already given its decision/ finding in the cases involving disputes and judicial matters or High Court or High Court. the judicial cases or judicial where the final order is passed by the Supreme Court
The study group is being constituted as follows with a view to point out common points where processes may be repetitive.
