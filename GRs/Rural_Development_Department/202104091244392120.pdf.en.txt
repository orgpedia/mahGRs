GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: PAMVYA-2020/ PROCESS-59/ FINANCE-4
The State has received instructions from the Central Government to make payment of works through PFMS system within the stipulated time. For this, PFMS-EGramswaraj integration has been done.
At the Gram Panchayat level, our Government Service Centers provide technical services related to the Central Finance Commission Scheme. Additional training is also provided. Under the 14th Central Finance Commission, funds were distributed only at the gram panchayat level. Therefore, the people's representatives at the gram panchayat level are aware of the above technicalities. But since the distribution of funds received under the 15th Central Finance Commission is to be done at all the three levels of Panchayat Raj i.e. Gram Panchayat, Panchayat Samiti and Zila Parishad in the ratio of 80: 10: 10, the makers/ checkers will have to be fixed at the Panchayat Samiti and Zila Parishad level at the time of DSC approval. Training and implementation of the same to the concerned public representatives will be a time-consuming process in the current COVID-19 pandemic situation.
3. Payment of dues for development works undertaken at both the levels of Gram Panchayats as well as Panchayat Raj (Zila Parishad, Panchayat Samiti) is required to be completed as soon as possible after due diligence as per prescribed procedures. In view of the above, e-GramSwaraj portal for DSC approval for all the three tiers of Panchayat Raj (Gram Panchayat, Panchayat Samiti and Zila Parishad) has been launched. The Maker-Checkers with the approval of the Minister (Rural Development) have been decided as follows.
Accordingly, the details of the makers/ checkers at the level of Zilla Parishad/ Panchayat Samiti/ Gram Panchayat should be uploaded on the PFMS system without fail.
