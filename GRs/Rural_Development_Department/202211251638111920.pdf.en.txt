As per section (100) and (123) of the Maharashtra Zilla Parishad and Panchayat Samiti Act, 1961, the local level schemes of various departments of the government are transferred to the Zilla Parishad and implemented on an agency basis. Under this scheme, all the District Councils are given establishment and non-establishment funds by the concerned administrative department in cash.
If the grant-in-aid sanctioned by the Government in each financial year has not been fully spent, the grant-in-aid may be spent in the next financial year. 1 has been approved by the government. However, if the subsidy is not spent even in the next year, then it is mandatory to pay the funds to the government accounts without delay. Also, the establishment fund must be paid to the government accounts immediately after the end of the financial year. However, such unutilised funds of the government are pending with the district councils. The non-payment of unaccounted funds from the district council to the government accounts is a serious matter and does not adhere to financial discipline. The District Councils have already been informed about the payment of unutilized funds to the Government Accounts through the relevant Government Decision/ Circular. However, it is seen that the unutilized funds from the district councils are not being paid to the government accounts on time. Considering all these aspects, the district councils are once again being instructed to take action as follows.
Government circular
The following instructions are being issued regarding the filling of Government accounts: 1) The establishment fund received by the District Councils from the concerned administrative department/ controlling officer of the Government should be filled in the Government accounts immediately after the end of the financial year.

(2) If the non-stipendiary fund received by the Zila Parishads from the concerned administrative department/ controlling authority of the Government has not been spent in the financial year in which the fund has been received, it is allowed to be spent in the next financial year as per the decision of the Government dated 6th June, 2008 of the Finance Department. However, if the said funds/ grants are not spent in the previous year also, such unutilized funds received from the concerned administrative department. The deposit under that section should be filled immediately.
3) Zilla Parishad Heads of Departments/ Chief Accounts and Finance Officers should ensure that the funds for development works do not fall at the Panchayat Samiti level while transferring them to the Panchayat Samiti.
4) The Block Development Officer of the Panchayat Samiti should ensure that the funds are spent within the prescribed time. Be sure to plan your work properly and budget for it. It should be ensured that the panchayat committee will not be kept even if the funds are not being spent. If this is found, it will be considered as financial irregularity.
5) The process of filling up the accounts of the government with the unreimbursed funds after quarterly review of the Zilla Parishad and Panchayat Samiti should be done regularly every year and the information about the action taken should be sent to the Rural Development Department.
6) The Chief Accounts and Finance Officer should keep a record of the information about the unpaid funds.
7) The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Accounts and Finance Officer of the Zilla Parishads shall review the unspent funds quarterly and take action to pay the unspent funds to the government accounts.
An up-to-date record of the proceedings should be maintained.
8) It may be noted that the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Accounts and Finance Officer of the Zila Parishads will be held jointly responsible for not taking action in this regard on a regular basis.
