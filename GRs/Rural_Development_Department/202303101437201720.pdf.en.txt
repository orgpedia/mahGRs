The suggestion is as follows: The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Uttar Pradesh State Government and Others Vs. Arvind Kumar Srivastava in 2015 recorded (1) SCC 347
The guidelines are as follows:-" Normal rule is that
when a particular set of employees is given relief by the Court, all other identically
situated persons need to be treated alike by extending that benefit. Not doing so would amount to discrimination and would be violated of Article % of the
Constitution of India. This principle needs to be applied in service matters more emphatically as the service jurisprudence evolved by this Court from time to time
postulates that all similarly situated persons should be treated similarly. Therefore,
the normal rule would be that merely because other similarly situated persons did
not approach the court earlier. They are not to be treated differently." In line with the above order given by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, there are self-explanatory directions that all departments should take decisions in administrative matters.
