Rural Development Department, Government Resolution No.PARAS-1093/ P.No. 2223/24, Dy. June 4, 1993.
As per the relevant provisions of the Maharashtra Zilla Parishads and Panchayat Samitis Act, 1961 and the Bombay Gram Panchayat Act, 1958, the land revenue cess grants and local cess relative grants admissible to the Panchayat Raj Institutions are not being disbursed to them on time. Accordingly, instructions were issued to constitute a Land Revenue Cess Grants Control Committee under the decision of the Government in this regard and to take necessary measures to ensure timely sanction of permissible grants to the Panchayati Raj Institutions.
However, the 5th State Finance Commission has forgotten the Government Order issued 26 years ago and has not held meetings of the Committee in almost all the districts and has recommended that an institutional grievance mechanism must be in place to enable them to receive payments as per their laws and Government Orders. Accordingly, it was under the consideration of the government to bring the provisions of this decision to the attention of all concerned.
Rural Development Department Govt. The Government decision of 4th June, 1993 is being brought to the notice of all concerned. The Government has taken decisions in all the districts as recommended by the 5th State Finance Commission. As per the provision of 4th June, 1993, the land revenue cess subsidy control committee should be constituted. Meetings of the Committee held in accordance with the provisions of the said Government Decision
