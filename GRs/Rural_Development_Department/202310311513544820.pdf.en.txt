Serial number in the list
11. With regard to the seniority list published earlier by the Government, it has been observed that the said seniority list is not brought to the notice of the concerned.

Corrigendums have to be issued from time to time to make necessary corrections in the seniority notice as per each such request application received. This also leads to cases of man-made disasters. The seniority list along with the reasons should be brought to the notice of all concerned immediately and the certificate for doing so should be sent to the government.
