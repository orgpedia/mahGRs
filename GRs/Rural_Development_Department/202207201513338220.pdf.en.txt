Accordingly, the Department of Rural Development. Detailed guidelines for implementation of the scheme have been issued vide Government Resolution dated 10.09.2012.
Under the Road and Bridge Repair and Maintenance Programme, road works have been divided into four groups- A, B, C and D. Under Group-A, general/ minor repair works are carried out to maintain the road traffic in proper condition. The type of work to be taken under Group-A has been decided by the relevant government decision. As per the Road Development Plan 2001-2021, the total length of other district roads and rural roads (Grameen Roads) is about 2,36,000 km, of which the remaining length, excluding the length in the core network of Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana and Mukhyamantri Gram Sadak Yojana, is with the Zilla Parishads for maintenance and repair. About 40% of the length that the district councils have for maintenance and repair is asphalt and the remaining length is gravel and gravel surface. As per the priority list for sanction of works from Group-A in the relevant Government Decision (para. 2.5) and Public Works Department Government Circular No. Narrow- 0798/168 (Part 1)/ Roads-1, Dy.

Section No. The other works in 2.5 are meant to be sanctioned as per priority. At present, the total number of mile workers working under the Zila Parishad is about 1482 and the filling of asphalt potholes and repair of parapets of bridges in Group' A' is meant to be done by the mile workers of the department. However, it has been observed that works are not being sanctioned by most of the district councils as per the priority list mentioned in the relevant government decision. As a result, the government is likely to incur huge expenditure on repairing the damaged roads if they are not repaired in time. To avoid this loss, the matter of issuing guidelines on the works to be undertaken on priority under Group-A was under the consideration of the government.
Government circular:
Instructions are being issued to all the District Councils regarding the works to be taken up from the grants received for the works in Group-A under the Road and Bridge Repair and Preservation Programme (Head of Accounts 3054-2419) as follows:
(1) In the case of sanction of works under Group-A, in the relevant Government Decision, in paragraph No. The work shall be carried out in accordance with the priorities set out in Article 2.5.
(2) At least 75% of the amount available at the time of sanctioning the programme under Group-A for repair of rural roads damaged due to heavy rains and floods shall be provided as per the provisions of paragraph No. 1 of the relevant Government Decision. As per priority 1 of 2.5, filling of potholes on asphalted roads should be taken up on priority basis and thereafter filling of potholes on asphalted roads should be taken up by filling them with asphalt. This will ensure that rural roads are at least as good and motorable. Also, the transportation system will be improved.
3) Among other tasks in Group-A, labor-oriented work should be done by the mailmen of the department.
(4) If it is necessary to carry out any other work in Group-A other than filling potholes with asphalt in view of smooth traffic on rural roads damaged due to heavy rains and floods, the work may be approved as an exceptional case. However
