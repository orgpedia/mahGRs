Under the Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya Housing Scheme, the beneficiaries do not get land outside the village.
c) Price of land: The price of land in Gram Panchayat areas in rural areas of the state is high.
Under the Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya Scheme, Rs. Up to Rs 50,000
Financial aid is available. There is no space available in rural areas with such low funding. Similarly, the permissible financial assistance under the scheme includes stamp duty, registration fee, counting fee, etc. Therefore, the amount of financing available to buy a place is very small.

However, at present, such land is not available with the Gram Panchayats of the state, so it is not possible to provide benefits under this scheme to such landless beneficiaries.
e) Collector not empowered to regularize encroachments on land belonging to departments other than the Revenue Department of the State: The Collector is not empowered to regularize encroachments on land belonging to government departments other than the Revenue Department and the officers of the concerned departments at the district level.
There is no right to issue a certificate. Hence, such encroachments are difficult to regulate.
