Preamble: In pursuance of the Government decision dated 14th March, 2018 of the General Administration Department, the Rural Development Department has filled up the vacancies in the Group-C cadre under the nomination quota under all the Zilla Parishads in the State.
Instructions regarding the online examination process for filling up No. 8 hereunder vide Government Resolution dated 23rd July, 2018 and vide Reference No. The government notification was issued on February 13, 2019. In pursuance of the Government decision dated 16/05/2018 and Government Sanction Letter dated 28/12/2018 of the Finance Department, a total of 13,514 vacancies in 18 Cadres of Group-C in all the Zilla Parishads were advertised through online mode in the month of March, 2019. These posts would be filled through the government's MahaIT exam. However, the exam could not be held as the Model Code of Conduct for the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections was cancelled.
2. In the context of Finance Department in the backdrop of Corona Virus outbreak, No. 11 As per the Government decision dated 04.05.2020, restrictions were imposed on recruitment in all departments except Public Health, Medical Education and Pharmaceuticals. However, it was later approved to fill the posts of health worker, health worker, laboratory technician, medicine manufacturer and health supervisor in the Zilla Parishad under the Rural Development Department as they are related to health.
(3) The Government has decided to provide the benefit of economically weaker section in the open category to the Socially and Educationally Backward (SEBC) category through the General Administration Department. It was issued on 23.12.2020. Therefore, the conversion of seats in the Socially and Educationally Backward (SEBC) category into non-local category is leading to a change in the parallel reservation in the open category in the advertisement of March, 2019.
Also, there is a change in category-wise/ parallel reservation-wise seats due to the increase in the proportion of compassionate appointments from 10% to 20% for a certain period and due to the compassionate recruitment process followed by the Zila Parishad and other reasons. Also, it is necessary to give opportunity to those candidates by publishing advertisements for the newly included category of disabled and the newly increased category due to the change in parallel reservation.
S.E.B.C. Reservation in Vacancy Matrix of the vacancies advertised in March 2019. N. Due to the cancellation of the court, due to Corona (COVID-19), increase in the number of posts of compassionate appointment and other reasons, there have been changes in the posts that were vacant in March 2019 and are now vacant. Due to the change in reservation, it will not be possible to accommodate candidates in the respective reservation category if there is no post left in the district council in that cadre. Therefore, it will not be appropriate to conduct the examination as per the old advertisement as the vacancy matrix of the vacancies in the March 2019 advertisement is changing in the posts in all the Zilla Parishads.

The guidelines were issued under the Government Decision dated 10 th May, 2022. Accordingly, the government had approved the filling up of all the vacant posts under the Zila Parishad at the level of Zila Parishad through the District Selection Board as before.
The examination to be held at the state level will have to be conducted from the district level according to the changed situation. Therefore, during discussions with the Zila Parishads in this regard, it was observed that there were errors in the data of the candidates transferred from the previously appointed common company and it was observed that some candidates missed the reservation category. Also, the zilla parishads had pointed out that since the data was complex and unclassified, it was not clear which candidate had filled the applications for which cadre in which district.
Therefore, due to all the above problems, the examination to be conducted as per the advertisement of March 2019 was cancelled and the matter of conducting a fresh examination at the Zilla Parishad level was under the consideration of the government.
Government's decision:
The following decisions are being taken regarding the recruitment of Group-C posts under the District Council under the Rural Development Department under the Mahabharati March, 2019.
All the advertisement, examination and entire recruitment process of 18 cadres of Group-C under the Zila Parishad under the Rural Development Department under the Mahabharati in March, 2019 and Mahe August, 2021 (including disabled and other revised reservation) are being cancelled through this. As the recruitment is cancelled, the examination fee paid by all the candidates for the application as per this advertisement will be refunded to them by the respective District Councils. The candidates will be informed separately to the District Councils regarding the procedure for refund of examination fee.
