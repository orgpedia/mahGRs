The Maharashtra Regulation of Transfer of Government Servants and Prevention of Delay in Discharging Official Duties Act, 2005. It has been in effect since July 1, 2006. As per the Maharashtra Regulation of Transfer of Government Employees Act, 2005, the principle of inclusiveness and equalisation is required to be implemented in the transfer of employees. Keeping in view the representations received from the employees, public representatives, the demand for repeated postings in the same district or in the same place, etc., there are administrative difficulties in terms of training in the department while implementing the Transfer Act.
Therefore, in order to bring transparency in the administration, as well as in the interest of trainees and students, administrative convenience, there should be a transfer policy that gives equal justice to all while transferring employees in the public interest. A training crisis can arise if there is no availability of teaching and non-teaching staff for training in the institution. Therefore, a policy is proposed to provide staff positions in the office of the maximum number of institutions, proper planning of the available filled positions, equalization of services. In order to implement this policy, considering the vacancies in Group-C to Group-D cadre in the offices/ Industrial Training Institutes/ Government Technical Secondary Schools, it was under the consideration of the Government to approve the adoption of online procedure for transfer as per the proposal submitted by the Director, Vocational Education and Training regarding the computerized (online) process of periodic/ special request/ departmental transfer of these employees.
