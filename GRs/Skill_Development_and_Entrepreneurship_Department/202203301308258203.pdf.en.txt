Introduction: Due to globalization, industrialization is taking place at a rapid pace in the country as well as in the state. Considering the total skilled manpower required in the state in the coming years, it is very important to increase the existing accessibility of vocational training and the number of vocational training facilities.
The National Skill Development Council (NSDC), set up under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister, has set a target of creating 500 million skilled manpower in the country by 2022. The aim of the government is to provide employment and self-employment opportunities to the candidates of the minority community in the state and bring them into the mainstream of society.
The Department of Higher and Technical Education has decided to start 28 new batches in two new Industrial Training Institutes to be set up in Mumbai City and Nehru Nagar (Kurla) G. It was approved on August 29, 2009.
