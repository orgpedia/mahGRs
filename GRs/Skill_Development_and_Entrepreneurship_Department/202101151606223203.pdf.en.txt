Government's stand:
For effective and speedy implementation of the skill development programme, the Maharashtra State Council for Vocational Training (MSCVT) has approved the standard procedure for affiliation of Vocational Training Institute (VTI) and Skill Assessment Agency (SAA).
The provision mentioned in Annexure 1 (b) (13) of the said Government Decision is that" the institution to which affiliation is granted by the Council shall be required to deposit the prescribed reserve amount in the bank account of" Maharashtra State Council for Vocational Training (MSCVT)." A meeting of the Committee empowered under No. 5 was held to partially modify this provision. In pursuance of the decision taken in the said Committee, the provision of (b) (13) of Annexure 1 of the Government Resolution No. 4 reads," The institution to which affiliation is granted by the Council shall be required to deposit the prescribed reserve amount in the bank account of" Maharashtra State Council for Vocational Training (MSCVT)" instead of" the institution to which affiliation is granted by the Council."
