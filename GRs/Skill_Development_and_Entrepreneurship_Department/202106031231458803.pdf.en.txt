There is a need to train educated unemployed youth of the state according to the demand of new industries and service sector and make them employable and self-employed.
Considering the number of unemployed candidates in the state, it is worthwhile to expand the scope of the apprenticeship scheme in the state. Therefore, in order to encourage and increase the recruitment of apprentices under the Apprenticeship Training Scheme in government, semi-government and private establishments, the government was considering to launch a' Maharashtra Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme' to supplement the Apprenticeship Training Scheme.
The Maharashtra Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (MAPS) is a scheme to promote and encourage the recruitment of apprentices under the Apprenticeship Training Scheme in government, semi-government and private establishments.
