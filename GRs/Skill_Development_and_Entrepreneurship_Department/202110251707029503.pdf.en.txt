Government Decisions, Employment and Self-Employment Department, No. ESE-1099/ P. No. 119/2001/ P.S.-2, D. September 8, 2006.
2) Department of Revenue and Forest, Notification dated 31.07.2014 3) Department of Government Decision, Skill Development, Employment and Entrepreneurship, No.
The Proposal:
Commissionerate of Skill Development, Employment and Entrepreneurship under Skill Development, Employment and Entrepreneurship Department. This has been decided as per the Government Decision dated 9.4.2021. Therefore, the manpower assigned to all the offices in the state will remain as per the approval of the high-level secretary committee. Accordingly, the number of posts in some cadres in this system has been reduced. In view of this, it has become necessary to utilise the manpower of some offices for the functioning of other offices.
Further, as there is no need to come to the physical office due to the online exchange of services on the digital platform made available due to the overall development of the state, it was discussed whether value-added services can be provided by further expanding the functioning of the registration office, technical offices and manpower. Also, the services provided by the Tribal Project Offices, Special Project Offices for Disabled Services, University Offices need to be enhanced and added value by using modern technology. This will save money and also help in better utilisation of manpower. In view of this, the following decisions have been taken by the Government:
Government's decision:
Special Project Office for Disabled Services:- Special Skill Development, Employment and Entrepreneurship Guidance Centre for Disabled Persons, Mumbai.
