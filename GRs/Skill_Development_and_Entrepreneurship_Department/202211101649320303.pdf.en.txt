The machines and equipment which are repaired over time are not usable for training. Therefore, such things remain unused in the institution for years. And because of not writing these materials lying in the warehouse, new materials cannot be purchased. Accordingly, the Director, Directorate of Vocational Education and Training has been entrusted with the task of de-registering the outdated machinery and equipment. The District Level Drafting Committee has been constituted vide order dated 1.10.2015. With the approval of that committee as well as the notification of the General Administration Department, 25.5.2006 as mentioned in Section-3, Section 9 (1),
