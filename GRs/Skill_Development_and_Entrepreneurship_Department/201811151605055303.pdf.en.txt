Introduction: Considering the globalization of the industrial sector, the need for skilled manpower has increased. Accordingly, various schemes are being implemented along with the Shilpkaragir scheme from the Industrial Training Institutes. Business courses based on modern technology are also being started. The training opportunities are being increased by introducing business course batches from the second and third shifts by making optimum use of the resources and training facilities available in the Industrial Training Institutes. Further, it has been decided to start the second/ third shift in the Industrial Training Institutes in the Municipal Corporation area and the second shift in the Industrial Training Institutes outside the Municipal Corporation area.

As per the decision, Rs. 72/- and Rs. 36/- per hour. However, since the remuneration paid to the hourly directors is very less as compared to the remuneration received in private establishments for candidates holding educational qualification for teaching posts as compared to regular employees, candidates possessing prescribed educational qualification and experience are not interested in being appointed on hourly basis for Industrial Training Institutes, especially in rural areas. Also, many of the candidates who are appointed leave the training work within a short period of time after the appointment. As a result, the students suffer. Accordingly, the Director of Sculpture, Director of Mathematics, Director of Painting and Director of Mathematics and Painting, who are to be appointed on hourly basis for taking theoretical and practical hours in Industrial Training Institutes, will be paid Rs. 72/- to Rs. 250/- per hour and Rs. 36/- to Rs. 125/- per hour was under the consideration of the Government for approval of the proposal received under letters (3) and (4) under reference to the Director (Personnel and Training).
Government's decision:
Director of Art, Director of Painting, Director of Mathematics and Director of Technical Education are appointed on hourly basis for taking theory and practical hours in Industrial Training Institutes.
The Government is pleased to approve the increase in the remuneration of the Director of Mathematics and Painting as follows:
