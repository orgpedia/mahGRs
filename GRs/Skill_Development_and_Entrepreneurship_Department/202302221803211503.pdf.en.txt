The Proposal:
At present, there are 419 government industrial training institutes and 575 private industrial institutes in the state.
A total of 994 training institutes are functioning. Seating capacity of these institutes is 2,12,464 trainees and on an average 1,41,796 seats are available for direct admission per annum. However, there are no separate industrial training institutes for the disabled in the state. Considering the large number of Divyangs in the State, it is necessary to provide and encourage vocational training opportunities for them at that scale.
Trainees admitted through the Central Online System for Vocational Courses approved by National Council for Vocational Training or Maharashtra State Council for Vocational Training under Craftsman Training Scheme in Private Industrial Training Institutes are being reimbursed 100% or 80% of the training fee as per the annual income of their parents. However, for imparting training in vocational courses to the differently abled trainees.
More infrastructure like ramps, lifts etc are required. Special educators are also needed for training. Therefore, private industrial training institutes are not willing to provide vocational training to the disabled. The Cabinet in its meeting held on 09.09.2019 has approved a scheme for one time grant for purchase of machinery and equipment to encourage private institutions to set up separate Industrial Training Institutes exclusively for Divyangjan.
