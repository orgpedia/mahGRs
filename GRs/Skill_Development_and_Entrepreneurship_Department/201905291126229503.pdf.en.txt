Letter No. 07/ CTS/ Training Fee Reimbursement/ 2018/473 dated 06/08/2018 of the Director, Vocational Education and Training.
Letter No. 07/ CTS/ Training Fee Reimbursement/ 2018/523 dated 04/09/2018 from Deputy Director, Directorate of Vocational Education and Training, Mumbai
Letter No. 07/ CTS/ Training Fee Reimbursement/ 2018/720 dated 17/12/2018 from Deputy Director, Directorate of Vocational Education and Training, Mumbai
The Proposal:
Industrial Training in Government and Private Industrial Training Institutes
CTS training is provided. The main objective of the scheme is to provide skilled manpower to the private industrial establishments by empowering the youth for employment and self-employment through employment oriented training. At present, there are 417 government industrial training institutes and 466 private industrial training institutes in the state.
2. Under the Government decision dated 14/05/2015 of the Department of Higher and Technical Education, the training fee to be charged for admission to the seats available under the PPP scheme in private and Government Industrial Training Institutes and Government Industrial Training Institutes has been approved. Training fee is the only source of income for students for private industrial training institutes and most of the candidates seeking admission to courses under the Craftsman Training Scheme are from economically weaker sections. They do not have the financial means to pursue engineering, medical and traditional higher education or tend to earn money by getting employment as soon as they pass the examination in school. Students who have not been admitted to the Government Industrial Training Institute can take admission in the Private Industrial Training Institute if they are financially able.
As a result, students are deprived of education due to lack of education. It is, therefore, necessary to provide some financial assistance to economically weaker students from all sections of the society to prevent them from being deprived of professional skills due to lack of financial capacity.
Socially Backward Classes seeking admission to professional and non-professional courses in private unaided institutions under the Department of Higher and Technical Education, Department of Medical Education and Pharmaceuticals, Department of Agriculture, Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries.
Students from economically weaker sections are deprived of professional courses only due to lack of funds.
