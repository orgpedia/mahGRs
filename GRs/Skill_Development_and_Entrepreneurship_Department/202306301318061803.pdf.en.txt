Ministry, Mumbai- 400 032.

The Proposal:
The Directorate of Vocational Education and Training, functioning under the Department of Skills, Employment, Entrepreneurship and Innovation, was established in 1984 to provide skilled manpower required for enterprises.
The Directorate of Business Education aims to ensure the flow of skilled workers from different professions, improve the quality of labor with training and increase industrial production. The objectives have been set to equip the educated youth for gainful industrial employment. To achieve these objectives, 419 Government Industrial Training Institutes, 163 Government Technical Secondary Schools/ Centres and 219 hostels are functioning in the State. ITI courses of 1 to 2 years duration are offered to the trainees from these Industrial Training Institutes and they are awarded certificates. For this purpose, these institutions have the facility of owning/ renting land.
However, there has been a frequent demand from various departments of the State Government/ Government-Primary Organizations/ other entities for land in possession of Industrial Training Institutes functioning in various districts/ taluks of the State. Similarly, other departments are also demanding space in Industrial Training Institutes for construction of hostels for trainees under them. Also, some of the places under the control of the institution have been taken for preparation of electoral rolls and other purposes and efforts are being made by the department to get back these places.
3. As the nature of curriculum in Industrial Training Institutes is being made technology friendly in tune with the changing times, the number of trainees joining Industrial Training Institutes is increasing day by day. With this, the Industrial Training Institutes of the state will become the central training centers for the industries in the future. Keeping this in mind, the department is in the process of preparing a detailed plan of the industrial training institutes to expand them and make them equipped with modern facilities.
Accordingly, the Department of Skill, Employment, Entrepreneurship and Innovation has decided to start professional courses based on latest skills as per the demand in the above mentioned Government Industrial Training Institutes/ Technical Schools and provide short duration skill based courses to the trainees.

A number of skill-oriented initiatives have been undertaken such as creation of workshops for creating constructive enterprise content through vocational courses, identification of entrepreneurs, setting up of Counselling/ Incubation/ Skill Training Centres/ Model Career Centres, providing support to reputed companies in the industry for setting up of Micro and Small Enterprises Centres for training of trainees in Industrial Training Institutes, providing space for Sub-Centres of Maharashtra State Skill University, etc.
In view of the above, the Department will require additional space in addition to the existing self-occupied space of the Skill, Employment, Entrepreneurship and Innovation Department. Accordingly, it was under the consideration of the government to take a decision not to hand over the land occupied by the Industrial Training Institutes, Government Technical Schools and Hostels under the department to other departments or any other institutions.
Government's decision:
Under the said Government decision, it is being decided that the seats occupied by the Skill, Employment, Entrepreneurship and Innovation Department and all Government Industrial Training Institutes, Government Technical Secondary Schools/ Centres and Hostels under the Department will not be made available to other departments/ or any institutions/ boards/ corporations.
" However,"" in case of any exceptional circumstances such as emergency, natural calamity or any other incident of such nature, if any department requires space in such circumstances and if the concerned department demands space, in such cases, the transfer of space shall be effected.""" The decision will be taken after Cabinet approval. "
