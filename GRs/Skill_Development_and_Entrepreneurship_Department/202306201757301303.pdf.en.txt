| The Proposal: |

-----------------
As per the recommendations of Dr. Kothari Commission in 1964, in order to train more and more youth in various trades, from the year 1978-79,+ 2 level vocational courses were started in the state with 30% coverage of vocational subjects. At present, a total of 16 vocational courses are being offered in 4 groups- technical, commerce, agriculture and fisheries. Out of these courses, 3 courses of Technical Group and 3 courses of Commerce Group have been revised in 1979-80, General Civil Engineering in 1981, Electronics in 1999 and Computer Science in 2000. No changes have been made since then. As a result, the business courses have been discontinued. Also, these courses are not NSQF compliant.
As per the notification dated 27/12/2013 of the Ministry of Finance (Department of Economic Affairs), Government of India, all the courses will be covered under NSQF within 5 years from the date of notification.
Compatibility is a must. Accordingly, the above-mentioned vocational courses being implemented in the state at present are likely to create difficulties for the children for employment, self-employment and higher education as they are not NSQF compliant. The National Skill Qualification Framework (NSQF) has been developed by the Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India, with a view to enhance the knowledge and skills at every level.
