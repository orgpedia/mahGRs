circular
The cases relating to various personal service matters (matters relating to appointment/ transfer/ fixation of pay/ date of transfer/ settlement etc.) of Group C/ Group D employees working in various offices/ institutions under the Directorate of Vocational Education and Training are referred to the Government. Also, in many subordinate cases, unreasonable guidance is sought from the government. Often, Group C/ Group D employees directly approach the government through personal appearance or correspondence. This leads to unnecessary wastage of time at the government level as well as time spent in resolving the matter.
Orders/ instructions are issued by this department as an administrative department of the government. The Directorate of Vocational Education and Training is meant to run the administrative affairs. The government has to take a decision. If there is no guideline on an issue, then the matter can be understood if it is referred to the government at that time. But, often the references are made from the directorate to the government without checking the prevailing rules/ acts. This has adversely affected the functioning of the government.
3. In view of the above, the Government is giving suggestions to improve the functioning of the field offices as follows:
(1) Proposals/ references regarding personal service of Group C/ Group D employees working in various offices/ institutions under the Directorate of Vocational Education and Training in respect of the matters entrusted to the Director, Vocational Education and Training as well as the Joint Director, Vocational Education and Training, Regional Office, should not be forwarded to the Government.
(2) If any guidance is required in respect of the existing rules/ provisions relating to service matters, the guidance proposals should be submitted to the Government along with the rules/ provisions in respect thereof, mentioning only those matters/ issues. The head of the office should first submit such proposals to the Joint Director, Regional Office. After that, it should be submitted to the Director, Vocational Education and Training through the regional office. Even after this, if there is a need for guidance at the government level, such proposals should be submitted to the government from the director level.

Under no circumstances should the proposal be submitted in the personal name of the employee.
(3) Proposals in respect of matters in respect of which the Director, Vocational Education and Training as well as the Joint Director, Vocational Education and Training, Regional Office have not been delegated, only such matters shall be submitted along with detailed explanations and documents.
4) It is often seen that the Industrial/ Labour Court/ Maharashtra Administrative Tribunal or the Hon. A decision is rendered unilaterally by the court due to non-appearance in the High Court. Therefore, the administration was duly represented through the affidavit as well as through the lawyers. The matter should be investigated in court. If negligence is found regarding court cases, a departmental inquiry should be initiated to fix immediate responsibility on the concerned officers/ employees and take action.
5) Ma. There are only two options before the court, either to file an appeal/ review petition or to implement the order. The court's order has not been complied with. Alternatively, the number of contempt petitions is increasing. So Ma. A departmental inquiry should be initiated to fix immediate responsibility and take action against the officers/ employees who do not implement/ appeal/ review the court order within the stipulated time.
6) In case of contempt petition in the name of the Secretary due to non-proceedings at the Directorate/ Regional Office level within the prescribed period, the concerned officer will be held responsible and an explanation will be sought from him and this will be recorded in his service book.
Everyone should take the following precautions.
