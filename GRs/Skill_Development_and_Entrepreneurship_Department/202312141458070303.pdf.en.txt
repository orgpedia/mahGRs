The Proposal:
A trained and experienced instructor must be available to provide the best quality training to the trainees. Accordingly, recruitment is being made from time to time. However, hourly Directors have been appointed on hourly basis for training as a temporary arrangement to avoid loss of training of trainees in case of emergency and during the period of recruitment. The hourly director is continuously doing the work of providing business training on hourly basis. Therefore, hourly directors working in Government Industrial Training Institutes under the Directorate of Vocational Education and Training are contractual.
They have been repeatedly demanding for appointment. The sit-in was held at Azad Maidan, Mumbai from 30/10/2023 to 03/11/2023.
2. The matter of forming a committee in accordance with the demand of the hourly directors of the Government Industrial Training Institute was under the consideration of the Government.
Government's decision:
A committee needs to be constituted to study in depth the provision of temporary contractual appointments to hourly directors in Government Industrial Training Institutes. Accordingly, the following committee has been formed:
