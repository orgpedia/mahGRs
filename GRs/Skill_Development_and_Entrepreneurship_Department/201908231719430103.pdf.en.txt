The Proposal:
Considering the growth of the country's economy, there is a need for skilled manpower as per international standards to meet the demand of industries. This factor of shortage of skilled manpower is largely seen as a barrier to bridging the gap between demand and supply of industries in the vocational training profession. Dassault Aviation, France is providing services from design to production, as well as maintenance, of materials required to enhance the efficiency of the Indian Air Force using the latest technologies. In line with this, the Dassault Skill Academy has been established to develop global training and educational initiatives. It is implementing training programmes to create skilled manpower required for production and maintenance. Accordingly, the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, Government of India has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on 03/07/2019 for a project to start three batches of business courses (total intake capacity 105 students) in Government Industrial Training Institute, Nagpur in collaboration with Dassault Aviation, France.
As per the MoU, Dassault Aviation will provide machinery and equipment as per the standards prescribed by the DGT, New Delhi for the above mentioned business courses and will provide the required skilled manpower and raw material for training for the first three years. The state government will provide funds for the project. Similarly, after three years, the state government is to provide other ancillary aspects, including skilled manpower, required for training.
In pursuance of the MoU signed by the Government of India, the Government was considering in-principle approval for starting three batches of business courses (total intake capacity 105 students) of" Aeronautical Structure and Equipment Fitter" at Government Industrial Training Institute, Nagpur on self-financing basis in collaboration with Dassault Aviation, France from August 2019 to July 2022.

2. Workshops and class rooms available at Government Industrial Training Institute, Nagpur should be made available for training in vocational courses. However, care should be taken to ensure that there is no disruption or inconvenience in the training of the batches of business courses presently functioning in the institute. No funds will be received from the government for the construction of new infrastructure and other facilities for the training of these courses.
Admission to the batches of business courses will be done through centralized online mode as per the provisions of the Government Decisions dated 14/05/2015 of the Department of Higher and Technical Education. The process of admission to two batches should be done in the academic session August, 2019.
Since the required machinery and equipment and raw materials as per the standards of DGT, New Delhi will be available through Dassault Aviation for training of Business Courses, the training fee should be calculated at par with the training fee charged for seats of Business Courses under PPP Scheme in Government Industrial Training Institutes as per the Government decision dated 14/05/2015 of the Department of Higher and Technical Education to meet the other ancillary expenses in connection with the training. The cost of training for business courses should be met from the amount received for this training fee.
The implementation of the proposed project will be carried out by the Institute Management Committee. The constitution of the Institute Management Committee to be constituted in Government Industrial Training Institutes has been approved under the Government Decision dated 12/07/2002 of the Department of Higher and Technical Education. Accordingly, if the Institute Management Committee has been constituted in the Government Industrial Training Institute, Nagpur, then the said Committee should be reconstituted as per the structure prescribed by the Central Government under the PPP scheme, otherwise a new Institute Management Committee should be constituted. The Society will be registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860. The draft of the Memorandum of Association and the Article of Association of the committee should be approved by the government.
A separate bank account should be opened in the name of the Institute Management Committee and the training fee should be deposited in it. The cost of training should be covered by the amount collected. The State Government will not provide any financial assistance for the project.
The project should be implemented by utilising the facilities available with the institution.
