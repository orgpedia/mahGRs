The Proposal:
Junior Clerk- Typists/ Warehousing Clerks in Non-Government Aided Institutions are promoted to the post of Senior Clerk on the basis of qualification and vacancy in the post. If the post (Senior Clerk) is not available for promotion even after 12 years of service, the post is given senior pay grade/ grade pay under time bound promotion. The Grade Pay (as per the 6th Pay Commission) for the post of Senior Clerk is Rs.2400/-.
After the review of the posts (Higher and Technical Education Dept. Government Resolution dated 22.5.2008) The number of posts of Senior Clerks has been increased from 33 to 8. These posts are in some specific 8 institutions in the Mumbai division. Therefore, the posts of Senior Scribe are not available/ sanctioned in other institutions of Mumbai Division as well as in other divisions (Nagpur, Amravati, Nashik, Aurangabad and Pune). The eligible Junior Clerk Typists/ Warehousing Clerks in all these departments have been/ are being paid Grade Pay of Rs. However, the Department of. As per the Government Decision dated 2nd April, 2016, Grade Pay of Rs.2400/- has been indicated and Grade Pay of Rs.2200/- has been indicated for the lone post. Therefore, in some departments, after 12 years, Rs 2400/- grade pay as senior pay and in some departments, Rs 2200/- grade pay has been given to junior clerical typist and store clerk employees.
Similarly, some employees have appealed to the court and the rest of the employees have appealed to the government. Considering all these aspects, the government was considering to pay a grade pay of Rs 2400/- to all the employees of the post of Junior Clerk-Typist/ Warehousing Clerk in the aided non-governmental organizations in the state.
Government's decision:
The posts of Junior Clerk- Typist/ Store Clerk, Senior Clerk are at the Institution level and promotion to the post of Senior Clerk is given to the Junior Clerk- Typist/ Store Clerk employees of the same institution. If there is no such senior clerical post in other organization, then the post of promotion is not available. Therefore, it is not appropriate to single out these posts in some departments and take different actions in this regard. Since such a situation has arisen after the review of the posts and it is expected to provide equal justice at the state level, read here No. VOC
