KAUVIU/ 2019/ Q.No.243/ P.S.-1, Dy. 19.11.2019 Introduction Globalization and liberalization policies have reduced job opportunities day by day. As a result, the problem of unemployment has become acute. The solution to this is to create self-employment by providing technical and vocational training to the youth, industrial training is oriented towards employment and self-employment. This training scheme has a great benefit in providing employment and self-employment to candidates who do not have higher education. At present, 13% seats are reserved for SC/ ST Forest and Buddhist candidates for admission to Industrial Training Institutes. However, many applications are received for admission. As a result, a large number of candidates have been left out of the fray. Keeping this in view, the Department of Social Justice, Cultural Affairs and Special Assistance has decided to set up six High Level Industrial Training Institutes, one at each divisional level in Mumbai, Pune, Nashik, Aurangabad, Amravati and Nagpur, under the Special Component Plan to technically train SC youth in various courses. High level Industrial Training Institutes have been started/ created under 09.01.2006. The government has also made a decision. The posts have been created for this institution with effect from 09.01.2006. Accordingly, considering the globalization and the need for modern technology and skilled manpower, there is a demand for higher level industrial training institutes in Nashik, Aurangabad, Amravati and Nagpur.
