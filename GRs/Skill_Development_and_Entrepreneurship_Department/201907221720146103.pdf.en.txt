Preamble: Under Articles 243K and 243ZA of the Constitution of India, the State Election Commission is responsible for conducting elections to all local bodies (Municipal Corporations, Municipal Councils/ Nagar Panchayats, Zila Parishads, Panchayat Samitis and Gram Panchayats) in a free, fair and transparent environment and the orders issued by the State Election Commission are binding on all.
Our country has adopted a democratic system and all children above the age of 18 years have the right to vote in the elections to constitutional bodies. All persons over the age of 18 are required to register their names in the electoral roll and are expected to vote in every election held.
The State Election Commission uses the electoral rolls prepared by the Election Commission of India for the elections to the local bodies.
The process of enrolling new voters and making corrections in the electoral rolls is continuously carried out by the Election Commission of India. However, every year in September-October, a program called' Summary Revision' is undertaken. In this entire process, the Chief Electoral Officer of the state, all the Collectors and all the Municipal Commissioners etc. take necessary action as per the instructions of the Election Commission of India. Despite this, complaints of many errors in the voter list are often received.
(a) Non-registration of names of persons who have completed 18 years of age as on 1st January and (b) Non-correction of electoral rolls despite filling up of information in Sample No. 6, 7, 8 and 8A, etc.
