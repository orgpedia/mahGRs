Government Resolution No: BUD-1321/ PR No. 41/21/ Health-7
Since the revised modalities of fund disbursement are to be implemented from July 2021, all concerned administrative departments implementing Centrally Sponsored Schemes have been informed to issue orders for appointment of Single Nodal Agency and Nodal Officer by 05.07.2021. Accordingly, the Government have issued the Order dated 27.08.2021. However, due to the lack of mention of the name of the scheme and the head of accounts and the implementation mechanism in this government decision, as well as the budgetary demand to be made from 2023-24 to be paid to MPSIMS, there are difficulties in submitting the information of the scheme to PFMS as the MPSIMS system is linked to the central government's PFMS. Therefore, the matter of issuing a revised government decision by superseding the government decision dated 27.08.2021 was under the consideration of the government.
Government Decision: Nodal Officer" State Nodal Agency" and Implementing Agency (IAs) are being declared for the following Centrally Sponsored Schemes being implemented by the Department of Public Health.
