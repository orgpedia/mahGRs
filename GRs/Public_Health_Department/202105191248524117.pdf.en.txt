The Proposal:
The" Safe Motherhood Assurance" programme covers all pregnant mothers, lactating mothers up to 6 months of age and all sick infants. The program is guaranteed to provide 9 quality services to mothers and children. All services under this program are free of charge. While doing all these things the mother's autonomy, dignity, feeling, right to choose the service as well as the services chosen by the beneficiary has to be given priority. Under the SUMAN program, it is necessary to promote safe pregnancy, childbirth and postnatal care and guarantee all health services to the beneficiaries. Accordingly, a proposal was under consideration of the government to form a committee at the state, district and taluka level to implement the Safe Motherhood Assurance (SUMAN) in the state.
Government's decision:
Zero tolerance policy has been adopted to deny free services under the Suman programme to all women and newborns visiting a public health facility. The programme aims to eliminate preventable maternal and neonatal deaths and diseases through preventive measures and provide a positive experience of childbirth.
