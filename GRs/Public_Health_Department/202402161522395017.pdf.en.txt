1) General Administration Department Government Decision No: SRV-2016 / PR. Cr. 90 / Karyasana 12, d. 19.11.2016.
Introduction: There are more than 300 cadres working in the hospital services as well as in the Office Group C and D under the Directorate of Health Services, Department of Public Health.
The department implements various national health programmes such as blindness eradication, nikash Bharat, leprosy eradication, national malaria eradication, various epidemic eradication programmes, etc. Since the appointment was made on a regular as well as contractual or seasonal basis under that particular programme, the powers of appointment were vested in the respective heads of the National Health Programme in the then circumstances. This made it difficult to streamline administrative work, with many appointing authorities.
Technical posts of the same function as those of the Group C category were under different appointing authorities, making it difficult to make such posts available for patient care in an emergency or emergency. Also, there is a slight difference in the nature of functioning of various posts in Group D hospitals. However, as the category names varied, it was difficult for the hospital management to transfer the employee from one cadre / position to another.
If a disease is eradicated or reduced over time, it is not possible for the staff in the positions available or created under the program to serve in other health institutions because of a different appointing authority, and therefore the available technical manpower is not fully utilized.
The government has set a policy to reduce the number of cadres by multitasking by integrating various tasks. Accordingly, there was an urgent need to mobilise the manpower of the hospital by integrating the different categories of Group D staff even while managing the hospital.
The General Administration Department has also adopted a policy of uniform educational qualification for different cadres of Group D to enable multitasking. Accordingly, the Government has decided to implement the Group D Admission Rules notified by the General Administration Department for Group D Cadre by the Department of Public Health. Issued on 24.02.2021.
