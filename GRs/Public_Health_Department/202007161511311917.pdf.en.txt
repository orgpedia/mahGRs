RASO/ RT/ Administrative Sanction/ 23379/2020 dated 09.07.2020.
Approved comments of the Commissioner (Health Services) and Mission Director, National Health Mission dated 09.07.2020.
Introduction: Under the National Health Mission, all ambulances and mobile medical unit vehicles in the state under the referral transport program are controlled through the central toll-free number 102 call center. A GPS/ GPRS system has been installed on the vehicle. The system was installed in March 2013. The warranty period of the device was three years. At present, it has been about seven years since the installation of this system, so this system is phased out. As a result, there are obstacles in tracking the vehicle effectively.
Keeping this in mind, GPS/ GPRS system will be installed on all 2647 government ambulances, 90 mobile medical unit vehicles, 889 supervisory vehicles of the health department and 1195 vehicles used on lease for the Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram.
