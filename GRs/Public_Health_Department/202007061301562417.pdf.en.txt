Introduction: In the absence of RT PCR lab in Satara district, swab samples for COVID-19 testing are being collected from B.J.
They are being sent to Pune or NCCS Pune. As most of the families coming to the district are from Containment Zones/ Hotspot Zones/ Red Zones, it is mandatory for all these citizens to get tested for COVID-19 if they have ILI/ SARI symptoms as per ICMR guidelines. Given the time taken for these tests and reports, the need to keep all these citizens in institutional quarantine is putting unnecessary strain on the administrative machinery and also incurring huge expenditure. In view of this situation, there is an urgent need to set up an RT PCR lab in the District Hospital, Satara. A proposal for an estimated cost of Rs.75,46,186/- has been received by the Government. As an emergency matter, the government was considering to meet the expenditure from the National Disaster Relief Fund or the District Planning Committee fund. Reference No. Under the letter mentioned in Section 1, the purchase of medical materials and equipment for preventive measures and treatment of COVID-19 in the state has been approved with the approval and recommendation of the committee formed under the chairmanship of the Collector at the district level. In view of the health emergency arising out of COVID-19, the Government is taking the following decisions:
