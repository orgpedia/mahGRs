Date: 12th of March 2020
Department of Public Health, Government Resolution No. 2013/ No. 225/ A-5D. As of October 31, 2013
The Proposal:
The Supreme Court As of January 4, 1996. The State Blood Transfusion Council has been established in Maharashtra by a Government Resolution dated 4th July, 1996. The main objectives of the State Blood Transfusion Council are to ensure the supply of safe blood in the state at a reasonable price, to implement the National Blood Policy in the state, to strengthen the blood transfusion service in the state and to provide quality, safe blood to the needy patient easily. When a patient is admitted to a nursing home or hospital and needs blood transfusion as per the advice of the doctor, the relatives of the patient have to run for blood and there is a delay in getting blood to the patient. The scheme/ initiative" Blood on Call- Jeevan Amrit Seva" through State Blood Transfusion Council was implemented in all the districts of the state including Mumbai as per the decision of the concerned government so that the relatives of the patient in the hospital do not have to run for the required blood and the patient gets safe blood supply at a reasonable price. According to the National Blood Policy, it is the responsibility of the hospital to provide blood to the patient in time of need. There are 59 blood banks in Mumbai and hospitals in Mumbai have tied up with blood banks near the hospital for the blood they need. Since the tied up blood banks supply blood to the respective area hospitals and considering the traffic and transportation time in Mumbai, the respective hospitals prefer to get blood from the nearest blood bank rather than the distant blood bank. As a result, the demand for blood from the hospital under this scheme was much less than the expenditure on the actual blood unit. The administrative costs are very high.

It was clear that more. In view of this, the matter of dropping this scheme for Mumbai was under the consideration of the government.
Government's decision:
Hospitals in Mumbai have tied up with blood banks near the hospital for the blood they need. Since the tied up blood banks supply blood to the hospitals in the respective areas and considering the traffic and commuting time in Mumbai, the respective hospitals prefer to receive blood from the nearest blood bank. Therefore, the demand for blood from the hospital under this scheme was very low. In view of this, the scheme is being dropped for Mumbai.
