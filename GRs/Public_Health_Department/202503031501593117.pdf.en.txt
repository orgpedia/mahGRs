1) Government Decision, Public Health Department No: Sink-2012 / Q. No.141 / Health-3, D. January 17, 2013.
The government's decision:
The decision to submit a proposal for creation of posts after 75% completion of construction of health institutions under the Public Health Department was taken as per the decision of the government in question.
However, due to the lack of timely creation of posts in the public health institution, it is not possible for the health institution to provide health services to the public at full capacity even after the construction of the health institution is completed. One of the main reasons for the delay in providing health services to the people is the late creation of posts.
There's a reason. Therefore, the Commissioner, Health Services submitted a proposal to the Government for creation of posts of these health institutions after completion of 50% of the construction of health institutions under the Public Health Department.
Do it.
