Introduction: Directorate General of Health Services under the control of Department of Public Health
The Government has decided to fill up the posts of Medical Officers in the establishment which are lying vacant due to admission to Post Graduate Degree/ Diploma courses under the service. No.of 545 Medical Officers in the establishment of Directorate General of Health Services as on 14.12.2016
was created. At present, the salary of medical officers working for post-graduate degree/ diploma courses under the service is paid from the superannuation post at the commissionerate level. Since a large number of these posts are in various health institutions across Maharashtra, it is not possible to pay the salaries and allowances of the concerned officers on time as it takes a long time to get the final salary certificates, service books, leave details while controlling them. As there are more problems in it, the government was considering a proposal to divide the number of posts at the level of the concerned deputy director at the place where the concerned medical officers are working.
