The Proposal:
The Union Government has approved the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Pradhan Mantri Ayushman Bharat Infrastructure Mission (PMAY-G) for the period 2021-22 to 2025-26. For the year 2021-22, the Government of India has allocated Rs. 1745.00 lakh has been sanctioned for general category. However, for the PM-ABHIM scheme, the State Government has 2210H463 for Central share and 2210H472 for State share. However, due to non-availability of head of accounts in the Budget Estimate 2022-23, no provision has been made for PM-ABHIM scheme. A supplementary demand for the same was proposed in the July, 2022 session. In the interim period, the Central Government vide letter dated 07.07.2022 had informed that the Central share of PM-ABHIM scheme would be withdrawn if the Central and State share is not deposited in the Single Nodal Account before 20.07.2022. Till the availability of funds proposed through Supplementary Demands for Grants in the Monsoon Session for State share of PM-ABHIM Scheme, the State share of funds equivalent to the Central share of funds under National Health Mission (NHM) in the National Urban Health Mission (NHM) is 2210F166 Central share.
1376.00 lacs and Head of Accounts 2210F175 State Share of Rs. 917.33 crore. A sum of Rs. 2293.33 lakh has been released from the approved budget provision for 2022-23. The supplementary demand proposed for the PM-ABHIM scheme was approved subject to the condition that the funds spent from the programme under the National Urban Health Mission would be diverted through reallocation. The funds were diverted through reallocation from the sanctioned provision under National Urban Health Mission to disburse State share equivalent to the Central share of PM-ABHIM scheme. However, as the data is not being shared with the SNA account of the central government despite diverting funds through reallocation, the turnover in the SNA account is not visible to the central government, causing a technical problem
It's happened. Therefore, in an informal discussion with the officials of the state finance department, they shared the data of the SNA account in the context of the PM-ABHIM scheme.
