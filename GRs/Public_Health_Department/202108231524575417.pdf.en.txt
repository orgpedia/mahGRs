Introduction: The case of a departmental inquiry against the then medical officer concerned in the case of the death of a patient who was admitted to the accident department in the government hospital due to chest pain and due to negligence of the patient is under consideration of the government. In this inquiry case, it has been pointed out that the victim had walked to the casualty department of the government hospital with a complaint of chest pain, the medical officer of the casualty department examined the patient and sent him to the intensive care unit, where there was no bed available, so he was sent to another department.
The patient himself was moving from one department to another for treatment, after going to another department, his name and other records were not on the case paper, from there the patient was sent back to the outpatient department. The medical officers of the casualty department did not conduct a preliminary examination of the patient or mention his illness and other details on the billboard while sending the patient to another treatment room. The patient had died at the hospital due to lack of treatment. In this case, while submitting a representation to the government, the investigating officer did not listen to him, the investigating officer did not take into account the subtle difference between the medical officer in the intensive care unit and the medical officer in the general ward, he revealed that he had sent the patient to the ICCU with the constable on a wheelchair, where he would be examined for ECG/ pulse. After the patient came to the intensive care unit from the casualty department, he could be examined in the intensive care unit in view of his complaint of chest pain and immediate medical measures could be taken on the patient even if there was no bed available. However, that didn't happen either. It is wrong if the patient does not get immediate medical treatment even after reaching the hospital due to the negligence of the medical officers or because they do not have the patient's name and other records on the case paper. Taking serious note of the incident, the administration has been instructed to ensure that such incidents do not occur. The Minister has ordered. The government is taking steps to ensure that such incidents do not recur.
