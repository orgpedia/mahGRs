A total of Rs. 4,02,00, 000/- in respect of the aforesaid Reference No. 1 Administrative approval has been given under the government decision here. It has been mentioned in section 7 that after the completion of the procurement process, supply orders should be issued only after the approval of the Central Procurement Committee. The V system is to be installed with cameras, while CCTVs will be installed in the remaining 123 locations.
Since the system is operational, cameras have to be purchased at that place. The cameras to be purchased from the state level will not match with the CCTV system in place where only the cameras are to be purchased. The cost of CCTV system and cameras is Rs. The expenditure up to Rs.40,000/- shall be met from the funds available with the Patient Welfare Committee of the concerned hospital and the remaining from the funds available in the Personal Pension Account of the concerned hospital. Therefore, the procurement of 389 units will be done from the unified directorate level and the supplier will have to go to 389 places to install the machine and make the payment. As there would be technical difficulties, the proposal of the Directorate of Health Services to approve the purchase at the district surgeon level and to allocate the funds for it from the funds available in the Patient Welfare Committee and the funds available in the District Health Society was under consideration of the government. The following decisions have been taken:
