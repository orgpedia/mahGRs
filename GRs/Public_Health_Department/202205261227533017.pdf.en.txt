A proposal to regularize the services of Mr. Chandrakant Gaikwad and Mr. Mishra from Aurangabad is under the consideration of the government.
All the eight mixers have been appointed by the Service Planning Office on a temporary basis for 29 days. Their temporary services have been continued due to non-availability of candidates by the Secondary Service Selection Board. The employees have been given 29 days" time. When appealed to the tribunals, the order of keeping the regular candidates in service until they are available, Ma. Their services have been further continued uninterrupted as ordered by the Tribunal, the resolution said.
In 1998, due to availability of regular candidates by the Secondary Service Selection Board, the services of 7 Miscreants at Nagpur were terminated from the post of Commissioner on 18.08.1999. The employees were protesting against the termination of their services. Complaint Application No., at Labour Court, Nagpur 144/1997 was filed. In this case, The Labour Court on 25.08.2000 had ordered reinstatement of the mixers. 233/ 2000, vide order dated 09.02.2001. The court's decision was upheld. This order was issued by the government. The High Court of Judicature at Nagpur. 2487/2001 was challenged. The High Court vide its order dated 07.01.2010 had directed to reinstate the Mishras and to pay them back wages and allowances.
In pursuance of the aforesaid Judgment, the above mentioned 7 Mixers of Nagpur were inducted into service with effect from 26.03.2003 (Ma. after the order of the Industrial Court). They have also been paid the salary, increments and other allowances for the period from 18.08.1999 to 25.03.2003. 35,06,846/- dated 18.02.2010.
The above The Labour Court, industry or industry. The High Court in its order has not mentioned that the services of the said Mishra should be regularized. However, these mixers were allowed to regularise their services separately in 1996. Industrial Court, Nagpur in Complaint No. 1111/1996 was filed. In this case, The Industrial Court had passed an order dated 17.01.2005, read with v. 5, that the services of 7 Mixers at Nagpur should be regularized with effect from 15.11.1996. The Department of Law and Justice vide its letter dated 06.01.2010 has directed the Public Prosecutor, Shri. Commissioner, RAK V.

On the contrary, against the above order. The High Court of Judicature at Nagpur vide Writ Petition No. 961/2006 was filed seeking benefits of regularization from the date of original appointment instead of the date of filing of the complaint (dated 15.11.1996). The petition No. 961/2006 has been rejected. So Ma. The order dated 17.01.2005 of the Industrial Court stands.
The then Director in the Commissioner's Office, vide his office order dated 09.03.2010, has regularized the services of 7 Mixers at Nagpur from the date of their original appointment. However, since the office of the Commissioner/ Director is not the competent authority to regularize the services, it is requested to give ex-post facto approval to the said order. Similarly, the services of Shri Chandrakant Gaikwad, Aurangabad and Shri Mishra have also been regularized by the then Director vide his order dated 07.04.2010 from the date of original appointment. Same is the case with Mr. Gaikwad.
Government Decision: The said employee remained in the government service due to the non-availability of candidates from the Secondary Service Board and the court has ordered to give them the benefits of regular service. The services of Serial Numbers 1 to 7 out of the eight employees mentioned in the table below are being regularized with effect from 15.11.1996 as per Court Order. Further, they are being allowed to avail financial benefits accordingly, subject to all the purposes relating to the service being uninterrupted from the date of their appointment to service.
