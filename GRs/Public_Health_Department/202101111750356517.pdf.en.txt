Government Circular No: PIVI-2020/ PR No.416/ SEWA-3
Gokuldas Tejpal Hospital, Complex Building, 10th Floor,
Mantralaya, Mumbai- 400
Date: January 13th, 2021
Read:- Government Resolution, General Administration Department, No. 2715/ Q. No. 302/ 8, D. February 29, 2016.
The Proposal:
Proposals regarding the expiry of probation period of several medical officers nominated in different appointment years are received by the Government from the Commissionerate of Health Services (erstwhile Directorate of Health). However, the Commissionerate does not send a consolidated proposal of all the medical officers appointed in that appointment year to the government. Therefore, there is no confusion as to how many medical officers appointed year-wise are yet to complete their probation period. Though it has been a long time since the proposals of many medical officers were submitted to the Commissionerate from the office where they are working through the office of the concerned Deputy Director, the proposal for the probation period was not submitted at the government level within the prescribed time, due to which the probation period did not end within the prescribed time.
2. Read the proposals of the General Administration Department regarding the expiry of the probation period submitted by the Commissionerate to the Government. As the scrutiny has not been carried out as per the provisions of Circular dated 29.02.2016, the proposal does not contain all the required documents and material as per the rules.
In fact, from the commissionerate level, the government is supposed to receive a complete proposal as per the circular mentioned here. On completion of two years from the date of appointment of the Medical Officer, the period of probation of three months shall be allowed to expire and his increment as per rules, including the name indicated in the seniority and other service benefits.
