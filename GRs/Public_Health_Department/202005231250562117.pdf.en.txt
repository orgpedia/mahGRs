Corona virus is increasing day by day in the country. Maharashtra has the highest number of coronavirus patients in India. Therefore, it is necessary to provide treatment facilities in more and more hospitals in view of the increase in corona suspected patients in the state. As per the Centre's guidelines, government hospitals in some parts of the state have been declared as Covid-19 hospitals. Against this backdrop, a proposal has been received from the State Health Guarantee Society to extend the coverage of the scheme to all citizens for a limited period to ensure that COVID-19 patients do not have to bear the financial burden of treatment in an authorized private hospital and to provide health assurance and financial relief to all citizens during the COVID-19 pandemic. A proposal has also been received from the State Health Guarantee Society to provide the benefit of treatment under the Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana to other patients along with the beneficiary patients and to provide the treatment methods reserved for government hospitals and to provide necessary equipment to the doctors, other staff and ancillary staff of the hospitals affiliated under the scheme in connection with the prevention of COVID-19 epidemic. Based on the proposal, the government has taken the decision.
Government Decision: Considering the possible situation in the backdrop of the COVID-19 outbreak, the beneficiary patients under the Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana and Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana, as well as other patients who are not beneficiaries of the scheme in the state, will be allowed to be treated for COVID-19 in the private hospitals empanelled under the Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana. Action should be taken in this regard as per the procedure laid down by the State Health Assurance Society. (The beneficiary will have to produce any one of the valid yellow, saffron, white ration card, tehsildar's certificate and domicile certificate as proof of residence, along with a government-approved photo identity card. The Chief Executive Officer, State Health Guarantee Society, Worli, Mumbai is being empowered to relax the requirement of documents for treatment in view of the seriousness of the Corona epidemic and the urgency of treatment. The list of packages included in the scheme for the treatment of corona will be as per Form' A' with this order. )
At present, 996 treatments are being provided under the Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana and 1209 treatments under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana, benefiting 2.23 crore families in the state. It covers about 85% of the state's population. However, in view of the present situation of COVID-19 outbreak in the State, the remaining beneficiaries who are presently not covered under Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana and Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana are the residents of the State.
