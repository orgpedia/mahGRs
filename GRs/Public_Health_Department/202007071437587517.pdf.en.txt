Preamble: Construction of Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory of Public Health Department has been completed in the premises of Sindhudurg City, the headquarters of Sindhudurg district. for this laboratory. The post has been created to provide manpower as per the Government decision dated 22.03.2018.

The proposal states that the fuel cost per consignment is between Rs 3,500 and Rs 4,000 to send an average of 50 to 60 samples per day to the laboratory. Also, the test reports from the laboratory are also being received after 5 to 6 days.
