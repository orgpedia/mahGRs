Apart from this, the school health programme has been included as part of the Arogya Vardhini of the Ayushman Bharat programme of the Central Government. In these programmes, concerted efforts will be made by the Department of Public Health and the Department of School Education to strengthen preventive and promotive factors through health related activities.
