# Page 6
They are not available in government hospitals. To address the specific needs of the trans-gender population, the Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACCS) has launched a first-of-its-kind initiative by setting up a trans-gender clinic in Kalyan and Pune cities of the state.
The trans-gender clinic provides services like psychological counselling, hormonal therapy and hair removal laser surgery. In addition, specialized and expensive health services such as Sex Reassignment Surgery are being provided at discounted rates by tying up with private/ government hospitals at the local level. The cost of treatment is borne by the trans-gender themselves. This clinic costs around Rs. 10.00 lakhs has been met through YRG Care, a partner agency. In the Amrit Mahotsav of Indian Independence, an initiative will be taken to set up 4 more such trans-gender clinics in the state.
(ii) Implementation of Social Awareness Campaign for PLHIV and CLHIV
People living with HIV (PLHIV) and HIV-infected children living with HIV (CLHIV) enjoy the fundamental right to live in a dignified society like all ordinary citizens. But, the attitude of the society towards the particular section of the society like HIV affected, PLHIV and CLHIV is still negative. Therefore, often PLHIV and CLHIV individuals face such situations of stigma and discrimination. Due to such treatment by the society, PLHIV and CLHIV individuals are completely exhausted physically and mentally while fighting the disease. As a result, the person's immune system weakens.
With a view to bring PLHIV and CLHIV persons into the mainstream of society and to reduce stigma and discrimination from the society, social awareness in a comprehensive manner will be carried out in the form of a campaign by Maharashtra AIDS Control Society. Through such awareness activities, information about HIV/ AIDS will be disseminated and other members of the community will be sensitized about the respectful treatment of persons affected by AIDS. This will help the AIDS-affected persons to interact with other people while living in the society and make their lives easier. Such awareness programs will be held in the Amrit Mahotsav of Indian Independence.

(ii) Setting up of Child Corner for HIV affected children and adolescents in ART centres.
ART is a life-long therapy. It is often not possible for children and adolescents to take regular medication. Adolescents and young adults have different physical and mental development than adults.
Their understanding of HIV varies. They need to be counselled according to their mental condition. However, due to the rush of patients in the ART center, it is not possible to provide proper counseling to children/ adolescents. As a result, there is a lack of consistency in the occurrence of cases in young children about the intake of the drug.
Considering all these aspects, Child Corner is being created in ART centres at AFMC Pune to provide counselling to children as well as adolescents on the right approach as per their psychological needs. From this Child Corner, counseling will be given to the children who come to the ART center for treatment. As a result, it is helping to provide regular medication to HIV-infected children. It is possible to prevent other diseases by examining other diseases of children also by pediatricians.
This initiative of Child Corner is planned to be implemented in other ART centers in the Amrit Mahotsav of Independence in the state. However, in order to achieve this objective, a Child Corner will be created for HIV-infected children/ adolescents in the 8 Zonal ART Plus Centres in the State, if the required space/ room is made available by the ART Centres in the Medical Colleges, by the Medical Education Department as well as by the Public Health Department for other ART Centres.
iv) Time-slot allocation for treatment at ART centre.
Every HIV-infected person needs to take ART medication regularly for the rest of their lives.
ART drugs are given to patients at the ART center for a month. Patients are required to take the drug every month. As per the existing procedure, every patient is informed to come for treatment after a certain period of time. However, the date and time have not been decided yet. Due to this, there was a huge rush of patients at the ART centre on certain days. Due to this number of patients, it is not possible for the doctors at the ART centre to give medicines to all the patients, as a result of which many patients have to go back and the patients suffer. Also, there is a high probability of contracting other diseases from this crowd.
# Page 8
Considering this aspect, if patients are given the option to choose the day and time as per their convenience, then patients will be able to know the day and time of treatment at home. Also, there will be no crowding at the ART centre and patients will not be inconvenienced.
In order to achieve this, a unique mobile application is proposed to be developed by MANIS. Very soon, such a mobile application will be made operational in the Amrit Mahotsav year of Indian independence. Through this mobile application, the timing of the ART center from 9.00 am to 5.00 am will be planned according to the convenience of the patients.
Joint Director, ART, Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society, Mumbai is being appointed as State Level Nodal Officer for effective implementation of the scheme in the State under Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav and to set up a State Level Cell for implementation, control and evaluation of the activities.
