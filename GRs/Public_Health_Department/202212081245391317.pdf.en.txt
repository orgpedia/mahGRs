Department of Public Health Government Decision No. dated May 10, 2019
Introduction: Under the Public Health Department, the washing service for the district hospitals, sub-district hospitals, women's hospitals, rural hospitals, and trauma care units etc. Administrative approval has been given for an expenditure of Rs. 20.11 crore. It has also been approved to meet the expenditure from the funds available in 2019-20. The orders for the laundry service have been issued for three years (i.e. from July 2020 to June 2023) by implementing the e-tendering process with the approval of the Central Procurement Committee at the level of Commissionerate Health Services. The budget for 2019-20 has been approved. But since the year is over, the district treasury officer is returning the payments by objecting to the payment when the payments for the laundry service are submitted to the account.
Hence, the payments are pending. Accordingly, it was under consideration of the Government to approve the extension of the period up to June, 2023 as well as to meet the expenditure from the funds available in 2022-23. A decision in this regard is being taken.
