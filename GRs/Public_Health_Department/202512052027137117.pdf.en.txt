Government Decision, Industries, Power and Labour Department No: Bhankhas-2014 / Q. No.82 / Part-
III / Industry-4, dated 1st December, 2016
The Maharashtra Medical Supplies Procurement Authority, Act, 2023 (promulgated d. March 17, 2023).
3rd Chief Minister of Maharashtra, State of Maharashtra on 9th July, 2025
Decisions of the third meeting of the Medical Supplies Procurement Authority.
The Proposal: -
The Maharashtra Medical Supplies Procurement Authority has been set up to procure medical items of public health, medical education and pharmaceuticals and certain other departments at one place. Medicines are purchased through a limited quantity contract through a tendering process as per the demand for medical items received by the Authority from various departments over a period of time. It involves simultaneously running different bids for the same item, receiving different rates for the same item.
This leads to delays in the supply of medicines and equipment. Also, there is no uniformity. For this, the purchase of medicines and equipment through the Maharashtra Medical Supplies Procurement Authority needs to be done through a rate agreement system and a tariff schedule is set for it.
Accordingly, Ma. The Chief Minister, State of Maharashtra and Chairman Maharashtra Medical Commodities Procurement Authority chaired the meeting. A tariff agreement for every two years for the procurement of machinery will save the government time and funds and enable uninterrupted supply of medicines, as was agreed in the meeting held on 09.07.2025. Accordingly, the Authority's committee has approved a two-year tariff agreement for the purchase of medicines as well as medical equipment and equipment in the state. The government was considering taking action accordingly.
The Government's Decisions:
The Maharashtra Act of 2023 No. In pursuance of the objectives prescribed under Section 5 of the Maharashtra Medical Supplies Procurement Authority Act, 2023 constituted under Section 13, it is hereby approved to enter into a price agreement with the pharmaceutical companies for the purchase of the drugs for a period of two years each to ensure timely and adequate supply of quality drugs to the all government health institutions in the state.
