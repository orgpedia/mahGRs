A separate Nodal Bank Account should be opened in the authorized bank for the scheme. In addition, at least a deputy secretary-level officer should be appointed as the nodal officer for the coordination of the scheme. In pursuance of the above instructions of the Central Government, the Department of Finance has issued a circular dated 01.07.2021, revising the modalities of disbursement of funds.
Since the implementation of the Centrally Sponsored Schemes is to be done from July, 2021, all the concerned administrative departments, implementing the Centrally Sponsored Schemes, will have a single Nodal Agency and Nodal Officer.
The date of issue of the appointment order has been notified as 05.07.2021. Therefore, the matter of appointing a single nodal agency and nodal officer was under the consideration of the government.
