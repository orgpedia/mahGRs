the prelude
The plague survey team was closed as per the government decision dated November 26, 1987, as no cases of plague were detected in Maharashtra since 1953. However, the suspected plague was detected in the state in August/ September, 1994, in a village in Beed district. A total of 634 patients were found infected with the plague in all the districts of the state. Therefore, the Plague Control Committee was re-established on 3 October 1994. So far, not a single case of coronavirus has surfaced in the state. However, as a precautionary measure, the plague team is regularly checking rats and fleas in Beed, Latur, Osmanabad, Pune, Satara and Solapur districts. A total of 17 posts have been sanctioned for this team, out of which 14 posts are permanent and 3 posts are temporary. These three positions are temporary. As per the Government Decision dated 27.07.2020, 01.06.2020 to dt. The period was extended till 31.08.2020. The matter of extending the tenure of these 3 temporary posts was under consideration of the government.
Government's decision:
Under the Plague Control Programme, a total of 17 posts have been sanctioned for the Plague Control Team (for Beed, Latur, Osmanabad, Pune, Satara and Solapur). The following 3 temporary posts have been approved for extension from 01.09.2020 to 28.02.2021 subject to the approval of the revised figure under this Government Resolution.
