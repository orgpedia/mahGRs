The committee had submitted a report to the government regarding the rates to be charged for RTPCR testing by private laboratories in consultation with private laboratories, considering the limited resource availability in the then lockdown situation. According to reference no. The revised maximum rates of RT-PCR tests were fixed in accordance with the Government Decision dated 24.10.2020 superseding the rates fixed under Government Decisions dated 13.06.2020, 04.07.2020, 07.09.2020 and 24.10.2020.

The maximum price of N95 masks is Rs. 14/- to Rs. 49/- has been fixed. With ICMR approving various manufacturing companies, the availability has increased.
