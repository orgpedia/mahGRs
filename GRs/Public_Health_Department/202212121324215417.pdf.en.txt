Govt. Decision No.: VAICHAPR-2022/ PR No. 175/ RAKAVI-2
Gokuldas Tejpal Hospital Complex Building
10th Floor B-Wing, Mantralaya, Mumbai- 400001
Date: 14th of December 2022
The Proposal:
The Maharashtra State Service (Medical Care) Rules, 1961, have been amended. Section 2 defines the family of a government employee. Rule No. Under Section 2 (3) (iii), the family of a government servant who is wholly dependent on the government servants includes his parents or his mother-in-law and father-in-law. It also provides that a woman government servant can choose her parents or her in-laws who are fully dependent on her. According to this provision, the service book of a married woman government employee must have a date-wise entry in the matter.
However, it has come to the notice of the government that very often married women government employees report to their office that" one of her parents or her in-laws has been selected for reimbursement of medical expenses of the concerned." Also, many times, the record in the service book does not mention the date from which the record was taken, which creates difficulties in settling the case of reimbursement of medical expenses. Hence, the government should come up with a new policy in this regard.
GOVERNMENT DECISIONS: At present, the following orders are being issued under the said Government Decisions.
(a) A married woman Government servant shall, before availing the benefit of reimbursement of medical expenses of either of her parents or her parents-in-law, inform the office in which she is working in writing by way of an application that she has opted for reimbursement of her medical expenses.
(b) On receipt of an application in respect of (a) above, the office concerned is required to enter the date of application in the service book of the woman Government servant.
