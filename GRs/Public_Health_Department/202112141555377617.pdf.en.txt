Introduction: Some medical officers working in health institutions under the Public Health Department of the Maharashtra Medical and Health Service, Group-A cadre, go out of their way to pursue post-graduate degree/ diploma courses privately without permission. Therefore, the regional level offices do not have the right to re-join the government service after their long-term absence without permission.
Medical officers who are absent without permission for post-graduate degree/ diploma courses cannot be recruited at the field level. Therefore, the government was considering to give powers to the field offices to reinstate the medical officers who complete the post-graduate diploma/ degree course in a private institution without prior permission.
Government Circular: There is a shortage of specially qualified specialist medical officers in the health institutions under the Public Health Department. Also, since health care is an essential service, the vacant posts of specialist medical officers need to be filled immediately.
Dated 23.07.2019. 25.07.2019, Dy. 30.06.2021 to D. 03.07.2021 and D. 02.09.2021 to D. The vacancies of Medical Officers have been filled up by nomination during 06.09.2021. However, many posts of medical officers are still vacant. In view of this, it is necessary to immediately recruit such qualified medical officers who were earlier working in the government service but were absent without permission for the post-graduate degree/ diploma course and are willing to re-join the government service. For this purpose, the Medical Officers who are absent without permission due to admission to Post Graduate Degree/ Diploma Courses as Health Care is a matter of urgency, may be engaged immediately.

Taking into account their educational qualification and the profile of the health institution, the concerned District Health Officer and the concerned District Surgeon are being empowered to immediately recruit them in the circle in which they were working. Also, medical officers who are on unauthorised absence for a long period of time for reasons other than academic reasons should not be promoted to the level of the said designated officers under any circumstances.
Medical officers who are absent without permission to complete the post-graduate degree/ diploma course should be reinstated in the government service without permission to join within 30 days after the result of the post-graduate degree/ diploma course. Also, the medical officers who leave the post-graduate degree/ diploma courses incomplete and become unsatisfactory should be recruited within 60 days from the date of the last examination. The concerned District Health Officer and the concerned District Surgeon should ensure that the medical officers who were absent without permission for the post-graduate degree/ diploma course should be recruited only after ascertaining whether they had gone for the post-graduate degree/ diploma course or not.
