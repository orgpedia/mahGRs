Preamble: Plague survey team was discontinued as per the Government decision dated 26th November, 1987 as no cases of plague have been reported in Maharashtra since 1953. However, the suspected plague was detected in the state in August/ September, 1994, in a village in Beed district. A total of 634 patients were found infected with the plague in all the districts of the state. Therefore, the Plague Control Committee was re-established on 3 October 1994. So far, not a single case of coronavirus has surfaced in the state. However, as a precautionary measure, the plague team is regularly checking rats and fleas in Beed, Latur, Osmanabad, Pune, Satara and Solapur districts. A total of 17 posts have been sanctioned for this team, out of which 14 posts are permanent and 3 posts are temporary. These 3 temporary posts in Plague Control Programmes have been created as per the Government decision dated 22.09.2020
