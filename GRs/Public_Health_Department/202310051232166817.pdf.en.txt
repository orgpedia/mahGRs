Preamble: Plague survey team was discontinued as per the Government decision dated 26th November, 1987 as no cases of plague have been reported in Maharashtra since 1953. However, in the state, a suspected plague patient was found in August/ September, 1994 in Khera village of Beed district. A total of 634 patients were found infected with the plague in all the districts of the state. Therefore, the Plague Control Committee was re-established on 3 October 1994. So far, not a single case of coronavirus has surfaced in the state. However, as a precautionary measure, the plague team is regularly checking rats and fleas in Beed, Latur, Osmanabad, Pune, Satara and Solapur districts. A total of 17 posts have been sanctioned for this team, out of which 14 posts are permanent and 3 posts are temporary. These 3 temporary posts in the Plague Control Programme were extended from 01.03.2023 to 31.08.2023 as per the Government decision dated 26.04.2023 under reference. The extension of these 3 temporary posts has expired as on 31.08.2023. The matter of extending the tenure of these 3 temporary posts was under consideration of the government.
