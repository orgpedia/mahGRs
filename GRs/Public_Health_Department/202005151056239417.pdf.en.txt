Date of Birth: May 15, 2020
The Proposal:
Since the Medical Officers (Group-A) working in the cadre of Maharashtra Medical and Health Services, Group-A (Pay Scale S-20: 56100-177500) are submitting their Voluntary Retirement Notice/ Proposal to the respective Regional Offices without submitting the same directly to the Competent Authority, it is observed that there are several irregularities in the proceedings of such Voluntary Retirement cases. As per Rule 66 (2) of the Maharashtra Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1982, the concerned Medical Officer is required to accept or reject the Voluntary Retirement Notice within a period of 3 months from the date of submission of the Voluntary Retirement Notice and inform the same to the concerned Medical Officer within the prescribed time. Similarly, if the medical officer is not informed of the voluntary retirement within the prescribed period, the government has no option but to accept the voluntary retirement notice as per Rule 66 (2) of the Maharashtra Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1982. Since the Government receives the notification/ proposal for voluntary retirement from the Commissionerate of Health Services after the expiry of the prescribed period, many court cases arise when proposals which are not in accordance with the rules are rejected after the expiry of the prescribed period. It takes a long time (1 to 2 years or more) as such proposals have to be submitted for concurrence and feedback of the Finance Department, Law and Justice Department and General Administration Department. So Ma. The court punishes the government and compels the government to pay interest on pension and other benefits to the concerned. In such a situation, the government has to spend a lot of time and money. Therefore, the matter of giving instructions to the field offices regarding the voluntary retirement of medical officers was under consideration of the government to avoid financial losses to the government and consequent court cases by taking measures against the said irregularities.
