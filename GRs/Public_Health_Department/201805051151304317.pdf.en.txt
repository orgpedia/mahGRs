In 2010, the Central Government amended the State Workers Insurance Act, 1948, under Section 58 (5) of which a provision has been prescribed for the State to set up a State Level State Workers Insurance Corporation. In pursuance of this provision, an independent State Level Corporation was constituted vide Government Resolution dated 21.06.2016. However, in the meetings of the State Workers Insurance Corporation held on 06.12.2017 and 16.02.2018, guidelines have been issued regarding the formation of societies for the State Workers Insurance Scheme. If the society is formed, the amount coming from the State Workers Insurance Corporation will be directly deposited in the society and important decisions will be taken quickly so that medical facilities can be provided to the insurance beneficiaries more easily and effectively. Therefore, the government was considering to cancel the formation of the state-level State Workers Insurance Corporation and instead establish the Maharashtra State Workers Insurance Society.
GOVERNMENT DECISIONS Public Health Department, Government Decision No. Rakayo-2014/ PR. No. 333/14/ Rakayo-2, dated 21.06.2016 is hereby revoked and the Government Decision approves the formation of Maharashtra State Workers Insurance Society for the State Workers Insurance Scheme.
