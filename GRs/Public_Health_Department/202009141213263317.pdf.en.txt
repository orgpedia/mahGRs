The Proposal:
The Director General of the Central Government, Central Drug Standard Control Organization under Health Services, Reference No. 6 is mentioned here. The letter dated 01.07.2020 outlines the guidelines for use of plasma therapy in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Department of Medical Education and Drugs. As per the Government Circular dated 29.06.2020, the Central Government has been providing free treatment to COVID-19 patients in the State. Guidelines for use of Convalescent Plasma (off label) therapy have been issued as per the guidelines in the Clinical Management Protocol dated 13.06.2020.
At present, free plasma therapy treatment is being used on a trial basis on Covid patients in government medical colleges in the state. After the Central Government and the Central Drug Standard Control Organization issued guidelines for the use of off-label plasma therapy, it was found that private and trust blood banks were charging unreasonable fees for plasma bags required for plasma therapy for the use of convalescent plasma (off label) collected by the plimapheresis method. In order to have uniformity in this price in the state and to make Convalescent Plasma (off label) available to patients at an affordable price, the government was considering to fix the price of this plasma per dose.
An expert committee was formed through the State Blood Transfusion Council to make Convalescent Plasma (off label) collected by Plimapheresis for the treatment of other Covid patients in the state at an affordable price. The committee will assess the cost of consumables for collection of plasma through plasma apheresis and additional tests/ special tests on blood as prescribed under the National Blood Policy.
