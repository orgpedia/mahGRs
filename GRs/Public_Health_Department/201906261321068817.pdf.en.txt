The number of security guards should be determined by measuring their office with the help of the Public Works Department and determining the district accordingly.
(2) In the case of work done by an external agency, in accordance with SGA-1506/ S.No.91/ Work-5, d. to be complied with the provisions of 08.11.2006.
3. The first priority should be to get security guards from the government approved security board or MESCO. If the security guard service is not available from them, the external agency should be selected in a very transparent manner by conducting the e-tendering process simultaneously and at the state level in the prescribed manner for all hospitals.
The service provider should be identified at the state level or at the divisional or district level.
The maximum number of security guards allowed for the hospital is to be approved by the concerned district officer as per the local requirement.
The tender document should include the condition that the next month's payment will not be paid unless the salary of the security guards is confirmed to be deposited in their bank account.
The proposed rates are estimated. Therefore, it should be ensured that the price fixed during the process is less than the market price and does not exceed the rate at which the supplier concerned has supplied these items to other places.
The guidelines of the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) should be strictly followed while implementing the entire process.
Supply orders should be issued only after the approval of the Central Purchase Committee after the completion of the process.
Since the purchase is more than Rs. 3.00 lakh, the purchase should be made by conducting e-tendering process.
The expenditure should be met from the provision approved in the financial year 2019-2020.
