Preamble: With a view to ensure that the relatives of the patient do not have to rush for the blood required by the patient in the government/ private hospitals of the state, as well as to provide safe blood supply at the processing fee fixed by the government, the state government through the State Blood Transfusion Council has decided to implement the innovative scheme/ initiative" Jeevan Amrit Yojana (Blood on Call)" in the districts of the state. The decision has been taken 1. Through this scheme, after calling the toll-free number 104, the hospitals and nursing homes within a distance of about one hour or 40 km from the district general hospital and the hospital attached to the medical college on a motorcycle will be assigned by the organization designated in the respective district for transportation through cold chain.

Government Resolution No: RSE-2019/ S.No.26/ A-5 Blood or blood components are supplied by the staff. In the implementation of the scheme, one agency has been designated in each district for transportation and blood/ blood components are being supplied to hospitals/ nursing homes from the blood bank/ blood storage centre on a motorcycle through cold chain/ cold chain by the staff of the designated agency. Under the scheme, Rs. 450/- for 10 km and Rs. 50/- for 11 to 40 Kms and Rs. Rs 100/-. Given the details of expenditure incurred on this scheme from April 2018 to March 2019, a maximum of Rs. 20,000 and at least Rs. 633/- has been spent. Under this scheme, 10461 vials of blood were distributed across the state in 2016-17, 12035 vials in 2018-19 and 14596 vials in 2019-20. In the year 2019-20, distribution of vampires was found to be high in Chandrapur, Gadchiroli, Bhandara districts but very low in Pune, Solapur, Jalna, Yavatmal, Satara, Sindhudurg etc. The scheme has an annual outlay of Rs. 3,20,00, 000/- (Rupees Three Crores Twenty Lakhs) but the scheme does not seem to be getting the desired response. Therefore, a technical committee was formed to review the scheme in the 38th meeting of the Governing Body of the State Blood Transfusion Council.
Government Decision: This Government Decision approves signing of Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) by District Blood Banks with Non-Government Blood Banks such as Blood Banks run by Charitable Institutions, Blood Banks run by Indian Red Cross Society, etc. When the blood of the group demanded under the Jeevan Amrit Seva Scheme is not available in the government blood banks, the district blood banks should provide blood to the hospital where the patient is admitted using the standard operating procedure through motorcycle rides from the blood banks that have signed the MoU. However, in such cases, the processing fee prescribed by the government for non-government blood banks will continue to apply.
The project is on an experimental basis. This will be applicable till 30.06.2021. After the agreement of the coordination of the District Blood Banks and Charitable Institutions operated blood banks/ Indian Red Cross Society operated blood banks, etc. non-government blood banks by 30.06.2021, the State Blood Transfusion Council will conduct a comparative study and submit a report to the government by the 10th of every month.
