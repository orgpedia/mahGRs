Letter No.5 of the Additional Mission Director, National Health Mission, Mumbai. RAASO/ RKS Cell/ Rukus Sammy. R/ P No. 30641/2020, dated 29.07.2020.
Preamble: Under the National Health Mission (NHM), as per the decision of the Government of India in Table 1 to 4 above, in accordance with the guidelines of the Central Government, all health facilities at the hospital level as well as primary health centres will be provided free of cost.
Patient Welfare Committees have been formed at the place and the composition of their Governing Body and Executive Committee has been fixed from time to time.
It has been observed that while it is mandatory to have a governing body meeting of the patient welfare committee in the public health institution, regulatory meetings are not being held in many health institutions. This has led to difficulties in the implementation of the National Health Mission. Therefore, a proposal to change the executive structure of the Governing Body of the Patient Welfare Committee was made at the meeting of the Executive Committee of the State Health Society. It was introduced in 31. Accordingly, a proposal to reconstitute the regulatory committee of the Patient Welfare Committee in other hospitals excluding the district hospitals was under the consideration of the government.
