Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, Mumbai- 400001
The date: November 27, 2018
Introduction: Many court cases arise in the public health sector. However, no action was taken in the matter within the stipulated time. The government did not provide the information in time. In view of the fact that judicial cases are disposed of expeditiously by quickly informing the court of the facts of the cases, further instructions are being given to handle judicial cases filed in the Public Health Department expeditiously.
Circular: Under the Public Health Department, cases are filed in the Labour Courts, Industrial Courts, Maharashtra Administrative Tribunal, Mumbai, Aurangabad and Nagpur and High Courts, Mumbai, Aurangabad and Nagpur and the Supreme Court regarding the service of officers and employees and some other technical matters of the department. In most of the cases, the Additional Chief Secretary/ Principal Secretary/ Secretary, Public Health Department as the head of the department is the respondent and subsequently, the Commissioner Health Services, Director Health Services, Deputy Director Health Services and other office heads are made respondents on behalf of the government.
(2) It is necessary to take immediate action as soon as the case is filed in the court and its notice is received from the applicant/ complainant. Proper sensitivity, promptness and alertness towards the court case is expected from the field office. It is a democratic process to change our attitude.

It's an important thing. For this, it is necessary to give first priority to the court case by considering the court case as an integral part of our work along with the office work.
It is common experience that affidavits are not filed within the time limit required in a court case. Also, the public prosecutors are not given proper briefing and information of the case by the concerned officers/ staff at the right time. At the hearing, the responsible officer is expected to appear in person and give the necessary information, following the government lawyer.
At the same time, the government's side is not effectively presented before the court due to insufficient information given to the concerned government lawyers and the affidavit in the case is not submitted within the prescribed time. At times, despite being given the opportunity, the officials of the department did not appear in court or the government lawyer did not appear for some reason. The court has no option but to give a unanimous verdict. In some cases, this is due to negligence. The court's verdict is against the government.
4. The Government side shall consider all the issues raised in the petition/ original application. If an affidavit is presented in the court in a factual, revealing and strong manner, it will definitely be considered.
The court does. Therefore, the affidavit filed by the government or the field officers should be as complete as possible after taking into consideration the laws, rules, policies and orders of the government. Consult a lawyer, attorney, or legal professional. Care must be taken to ensure that there are no errors in the statement.
Similarly, in judicial matters, the lower court's decision is not appealed to the higher court by the government lawyers and the administrative department by taking the opinion of the Department of Law and Justice and the Department of Finance and General Administration where necessary. If the appeal is not filed in time, the appeal is dismissed on the grounds of delay in the higher court. In many cases. Despite the court's order, the decision was not implemented. Therefore, the secretary and other senior officials of the department have to face contempt petition. In some cases, senior officers have to pay court appearance or penalty or cost of litigation. That's why Ma. The image of the department in the court was tarnished. We all need to take precautions to prevent this. The government should always play the role of model litigant.
