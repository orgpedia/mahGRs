the Department of Public Health
Government Resolution No. Budget 2020/ No. 73
Hospital, 8th floor
The Ministry, Mumbai 400 001
Date: 9th of November, 2021
Read- Department of Public Health, Government Decision No. 158/ Budget No. 158/ Budget No. 16/ 2016 28th September, 2016.
As per the decision of the government, orders have been issued regarding the district annual plans to be implemented by the field offices under the Public Health Department. However, there is no uniformity in the district annual plan to be implemented in all the districts in this order. As all the schemes have not been implemented in all the districts, it has not been possible for some districts to provide better health services to the citizens by providing funds under specific schemes. Considering this, the government was considering a proposal to take a self-explanatory decision regarding the district annual plans related to this department to be implemented in the state.
In the light of the above Government decision, the District Annual Plan (General) proposal to be implemented by this Department was submitted to the Planning Department for approval. Based on the feedback received from the Planning Department in this regard, the Government is approving the implementation of the following schemes as District Annual Plans by all the District Surgeons. District Surgeons (All)- District Hospitals, Divisional Referral Hospitals, Trauma Care Units, Women Hospitals, Rural Hospitals and Mobile Ashramshala Teams, etc.
