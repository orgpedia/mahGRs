Government's decision:
Nandurbar district is located in a remote and hilly region and Dhadgaon and Akkalkuwa of the district are geographically inaccessible areas due to lack of communication, roads, power supply and other facilities. This will ensure 100 per cent vaccination. At the primary health centre level, there is a huge problem of monitoring due to the problems there.
The details of population, total number of PHCs, number of sub-centres and number of beneficiaries expected to be vaccinated in Nandurbar district at present are as follows:
