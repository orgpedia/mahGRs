Introduction: The Service Admission Rules for the post of Superintendents were notified in 1964. As per this notification or earlier, the Fraternal Superintendents from the Surgeon General's period were being retained in service after the completion of the bond period. However, as stated in the Government Circular dated 25.08.2005, Shri. The Supreme Court had made it mandatory to enter government service through temporary/ temporary appointments or regularisation of services in a manner prescribed by the government. At that time, the Service Admission Rules of the Superintendents' Cadre were amended vide notification dated 15.04.2015.
Rule 13 of the Access to Services Rules, notified on 15.04.2015, reads as follows:
" Notwithstanding anything contained above, the Principals who have been appointed to the Government service as per the bond dated 31st December, 2011 and have not been regularized in service as per the bond, shall be required to pass a special written examination conducted by the Maharashtra Knowledge Corporation or such authorised agency as the Government may determine for regularization of their services.
(1) The Principals who fail to pass the written examination on one occasion will be given another opportunity for the written examination.
Those who fail to clear the written exam in the second attempt will be given one last chance to appear for the written exam.
(3) The services of those who do not pass the written examination at the last opportunity as per the provision of sub-rule (b) shall be terminated forthwith. Provided that the services of the Fraternal Attendants who pass the examination by special chance shall be deemed to be regular from the date of publication of these rules.
As per the aforesaid notification, the Superintendents as on 31.12.2011 have been deemed to be eligible for the Special Accounting Examination. However, during the period from 01.01.2012 to 15.04.2015

GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: SEPRENI 2019/ PR No.118/ SERVICE 5
There have been several court cases regarding regularization of services of the incumbent Principals as they did not qualify for the special written examination. After considering all this, the matter of making the bonded labour officers in the government service eligible for the special accounting examination from the date of notification of the Service Admission Rules i.e. till 15.04.2015 was under the consideration of the government.
Accordingly, the Government have decided as follows: 1. The Board of Directors of the Directorate of Health Services under the Department of Public Health and the State Workers Insurance Scheme as on 15.04.2015 are being considered eligible for special audit. However, after 15.04.2015, the appointment of all the Superintendents will be made by this nomination.
In this regard, the process of notifying the amendments in the Service Access Rules is being carried out separately.
In addition, from the academic year 2019-20, the government is going to stop taking bonds from the nurses who are undergoing training and passing out in the Government College of Nurses.
4. The Circle wise seniority list should be prepared separately for the present office bearers (as on academic year 2019) and they should be appointed on temporary basis (for a period of 6 months) in the vacant post on rotation basis as per the seniority of service.
This decision is being implemented by the Directorate of Health Services under the Public Health Department and the State Workers Insurance Scheme for all the fraternal guardianship cadres.
