Date: 17th of July 2018
In the Public Health Department, various health institutions from the sub-centre level to the district hospital level are functioning from the village level to the district headquarters. Preventive health facilities as well as secondary and tertiary treatment facilities are provided by this health institution. At the district level, sub-centres, primary health centres and taluk health officer offices are under the control of the district health officer. Also, the district surgeon controls the rural hospital, sub-district hospital and district hospital. The Deputy Director, Health Services looks after the districts under this department. In the absence of a separate administrative cadre in the public health department, a definite policy regarding appointments to senior positions cannot be implemented. The creation of a separate Public Health Administrative Cadre under the Public Health Department by some other States has opened the way for promotion of medical officers. Also, the medical and administrative services have improved. Similarly, there is a need to change the structure of health care in the state. The government had constituted an expert committee to look into the matter.
