Life Time Hospital and Medical College, Padve, Ta. Kudal, G. Sindhudurg with Govt. As the agreement was not signed as per the Government decision dated 19.12.2016, the approval granted to the institution to use the beds of the district hospital for educational purposes is being cancelled.
Earlier, the district general hospitals for government medical colleges like Dhule, Jalgaon, Nanded, Gondia, Latur and Chandrapur have been transferred to the Department of Medical Education and Medicines. Considering the experience of the District Surgeons, the Department was faced with the following problems: 1) Adequate funds were not being made available for the construction of the new Medical College building, salaries and other expenses. The construction of the medical college continues for 8-10 years. The availability of facilities as per MCI norms takes a lot of financial allocation, which puts pressure on the hospital and the quality of patient care is not maintained.
Rural Hospitals/ Sub-District Hospitals/ Primary Health Centres in the respective districts
Patients referred by the centre are not given priority admission in the medical college.
3) The Dean is not effectively implementing the programmes of the National Health Mission from the District Hospital and the funds of the National Health Mission are also not being spent.

4) The dual control leads to administrative chaos and affects the functioning of the hospital and in turn, the patients do not get good service.
5) Despite the creation of the post due to the availability of the staff of the Public Health Department, the College of Medical Education, the Dean has not been filling the post for years. Therefore, the public health department often faces the problem of low staffing.
The deputed staff of the health department at the medical college are not willing to work in rural areas, so they often make demands for the permanent inclusion of the staff in the medical education department.
7) After the construction of the medical college building, the original building is returned to the Public Health Department.
8) Due to dual control, important activities such as SNCU/ DEIC/ Dialysis are not carried out well.
In view of the above serious problems, the Department of Medical Education and Pharmaceuticals should take action in this regard in a planned and time-bound manner as follows: (9) The Department should make necessary planning and provision of funds for the completion of the Government Medical College building within three years.
A Drawing and Disbursing Officer should be appointed for the salary and allowances of the employees on deputation and financial provision should be made for it from the beginning.
(2) A separate room should be created for admitting patients referred by the rural hospitals/ sub-district hospitals/ primary health centres in the concerned district on priority.
(3) The ongoing programmes of the National Health Mission should be implemented in a non-compoundable and effective manner and the expenditure of funds available for the same should be monitored and reports in this regard should be submitted to the concerned National Health Mission office from time to time.
(4) The Dean shall primarily look after the medical education and deal with the matters relating to the District Hospital, preferably in collaboration with the District Surgeon/ the Head of the Administration concerned.
