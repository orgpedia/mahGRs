Date of Birth: May 25, 2020
Reference: 1) Public Health Department Government letter No. Corona-2020/ PR No. 58/ Health-5, dated 24.03.2020 2) Collector, Ratnagiri office letter No. Jir/ Corona Virus/ Laboratory/ 2020, dated 20.05.2020.
Preamble: In the absence of RT PCR lab in Ratnagiri district, swab samples are being sent to Miraj Medical College, G. Sangli for testing of COVID-19. The distance between Ratnagiri and Miraj is more than 200 km. As the terrain of Ratnagiri district is hilly and inaccessible considering the topography and connectivity, a lot of time and money is being spent on transportation and testing of swab samples for COVID-19 testing. A large number of families from Mumbai and Pune are settled in Ratnagiri district. Since most of these households are in containment zones/ hotspot zones/ red zones, it is mandatory for all such citizens to undergo COVID-19 test for ILI/ SARI symptoms as per ICMR guidelines. Given the time taken for these tests and reports, the need to keep all these citizens in institutional quarantine is putting unnecessary strain on the administrative machinery and also incurring huge expenditure. In view of this situation, there is an urgent need to set up RT PCR Lab at District Hospital, Ratnagiri, therefore, a committee headed by the Collector has discussed with AIIMS Nagpur regarding the cost of equipment/ equipment and possible expenditure for this purpose.
A proposal for an estimated cost of Rs 1,07,06, 920/- has been received by the Government. As an emergency matter, the government was considering to spend it from the Chief Minister's Relief Fund.
