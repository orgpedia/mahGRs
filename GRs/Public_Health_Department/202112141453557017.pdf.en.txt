Both RT-PCR and Rapid Antigen Tests are used to diagnose COVID-19. However, due to the high sensitivity of the RTPCR test, it is considered the gold standard test. The rapid RT-PCR test is faster than the traditional RT-PCR test, which takes 15 to 30 minutes. Therefore, these tests are performed during airport or urgent train travel or other medical emergencies. However, the cost of the Rapid RTPCR test is higher than the normal RTPCR test. Reagents, VTM kits and PPE kits, RNA extraction kits required for testing are available at very affordable prices on GeM portal. With ICMR approving various manufacturing companies, the availability has increased.
The number of labs accredited by ICMR and NABL has also increased significantly in the state. Keeping all these factors in mind, it was necessary to reduce the rate of Rapid RTPCR testing. In view of reference no. The committee constituted as per the government decision mentioned in Section 1 was directed to revise the rates of Rapid RTPCR test. The committee has submitted its report to the government. Accordingly, the matter of fixing the revised rates of Rapid RTPCR test was under the consideration of the government. The government has taken the following decisions:
The government's decision:
