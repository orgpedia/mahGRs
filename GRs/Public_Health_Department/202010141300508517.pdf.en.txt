The Proposal:
Accident victims received timely treatment in the Golden Hour and patients were close.
Relocating to a hospital will help reduce the rate of death and disability. Especially if the fracture patients are technically stabilized and relocated properly, the damage caused can be prevented. Also, if the accident victim is bleeding and such a patient is shifted on time, the blood and blood components will save the patient's life. Also, timely oxygenation and proper evacuation of brain-injured patients will help in reducing the mortality and brain injury of such patients. Considering the objective of providing timely treatment to the accident victims in the golden hour and shifting them to the nearest hospital at the earliest, the Cabinet in its meeting held on 16.09.2020 has decided to provide Rs. Balasaheb Thackeray Road Accident Insurance
The plan has been approved. Accordingly, the state government has decided to implement the scheme.

People who are injured in industrial accidents, daily work or home accidents and railway accidents will not get the benefit of this scheme. Also, to avoid duplication, the beneficiary of this scheme will not get the benefit of any other scheme of accident compensation of the government/ government-recognized enterprise.

Rs.30,000/- per patient per accident (Rs. 30 thousand) will be paid by the insurance company to the hospital affiliated under this scheme as per the rate of the package finalized.

In such a situation, in addition to the price of the package, the rent of the patient carrier up to Rs 1000 will be given by the insurance company to the authorized hospital. If the hospital is recognized under Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana/ Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana and the patient is a beneficiary of the scheme and the treatment is among the scheme and its prior approval has been obtained, then the hospital will not receive the amount of the scheme for that treatment.
