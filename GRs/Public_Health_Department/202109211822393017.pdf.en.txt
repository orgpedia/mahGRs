The Proposal:
The plague survey team was closed as per the government decision dated November 26, 1987, as no cases of plague were detected in Maharashtra since 1953. However, the suspected plague was detected in the state in August/ September, 1994, in a village in Beed district. A total of 634 patients were found infected with the plague in all the districts of the state. Therefore, the Plague Control Committee was re-established on 3 October 1994. So far, not a single case of coronavirus has surfaced in the state. However, as a precautionary measure, the plague team is regularly checking rats and fleas in Beed, Latur, Osmanabad, Pune, Satara and Solapur districts. A total of 17 posts have been sanctioned for this team, out of which 14 posts are permanent and 3 posts are temporary. These 3 temporary posts in the Plague Control Programme were extended from 01.03.2021 to 31.08.2021 as per the Government decision dated 16.03.2021. The matter of extending the tenure of these 3 temporary posts was under consideration of the government.
