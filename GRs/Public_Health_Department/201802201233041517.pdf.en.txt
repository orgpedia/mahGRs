a) Cure at least 90% of new sputum-contaminated TB patients and maintain this rate.
b) To detect at least 90% of the expected TB cases and maintain this rate.
Till 2013-14, the programme was receiving funds from the Central Government through Mutual Implementation Authorities. Hence, the programme could not be implemented. Since 2014-15, the Central Government has made a policy change in the distribution of funds and now the funds of the Central Government will be deposited in the state treasury and after budgeting the funds will be allocated to the concerned programme implementation officers. The National Tuberculosis Control Programme has been included under the National Health Mission (NHM) of the Government of India since 2014-15 with a funding ratio of 75:25 between the Central Government and the State Governments for implementation of the programme. However, since 2015-16, the ratio has been 60:40. The government was planning to allocate funds for the project.

To meet the expenses of transportation and sputum sampling of TB and MDR suspected patients, as well as for Supervision& Monitoring, etc., the Central share received for the second installment of 2016-17 under the said scheme is Rs. An amount of Rs. 72.53 lakhs (Rupees Seventy Two Lakhs Fifty Three Thousand only) is being sanctioned.
