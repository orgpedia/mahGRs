GOVERNMENT DECISION NO. MAFUYO-2021/ Q.No.103/ HEALTH-6 dated 18th May, 2021
Mucormycosis is a common infection among Covid-19 patients. Mucormycosis is a fungal infection that requires the services of a multidisciplinary specialist such as Microbiologist, Internal Medicine Specialist, Intensivist, Neurologist, ENT Specialist, Ophthalmologist, Dentist, Maxillofacial/ Plastic Surgeon and Biochemist. Mahatma Jyotirao Phule Jan Arogya Yojana- Rhinocerebral Mucormycosis for 10 Days' Stay is available in this package.
Other medical and surgical treatment packages are also available. However, the severity of mucormycosis, which is currently prevalent in the state, is high and requires multi-faceted specialist services. Also, the cost is high.
As a result, people are facing huge financial burden due to the high cost of treatment in private hospitals. Against this backdrop, a proposal has been received from the State Health Guarantee Society to ensure that patients suffering from Mucormycosis do not have to bear the financial burden of treatment in the hospital and all citizens get health assurance and financial relief in the hospitals affiliated to the Mahatma Jyotirao Phule Jan Arogya Yojana. Based on the proposal, the government has taken the decision.
