Read:- (1) Joint Director (Technical) National Health Mission, Mumbai's letter No. RAASO/ Your Dispensary/ 18998-19001/2023 dated 12/05/2023.
Health services are provided to the people of the state through primary health centres, urban primary health centres, sub-centres, rural hospitals, women's hospitals, sub-district hospitals, district hospitals, medical college hospitals and municipal hospitals. In urban areas
Due to the distance of the urban primary health centres from the densely populated areas and slum dwellings, due to the improper timing of the work of the urban primary health centres, some slums and slum-like areas are deprived of health services. The Government's strategy is to enhance the health index of the State by providing consistent health, quality services as well as accessible and affordable world-class health services to make the clinics of the State up-to-date with state-of-the-art technology. There are no health and wellness centres in urban areas. As a result, the general public is deprived of health services. In many states of the country, to provide quality health services and to increase the health index, experiments have been started to provide health services by setting up clinics in densely populated areas and slum areas in urban areas. On the same lines, the Mumbai Municipal Corporation has set up the" Hindu Hriday Samrat Balasaheb Thackeray Apna Dawakhana" centre in the year 2022-23. Due to the good response from the public, our dispensary centers have been started in the Mumbai Municipal Corporation area at a total of 155 places. Outpatient services have been provided to a total of 7,43,570 patients till April 2023. He said that on the lines of Mumbai Municipal Corporation,' Hindu Hriday Samrat Balasaheb Thackeray Apna Dawakhana" will be set up at 700 places in the State. Deputy Chief Minister
