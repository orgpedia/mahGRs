The Appendix- 6.
The details of Anganwadi Register are given in the table given in the Annexure No. 6 of the Government Decision dated 7th December, 2017 as per the" Useful Register for Coordination."

Annexure-9: Controlling the analysis of indexes.
Since the index analysis is expected to be controlled with the help of HMIS and CAS software, the health workers and ASHA volunteers should ensure that the same index-wise data is fed into the HMIS and the Anganwadi worker into the CAS every month. The reviewing authority should use the information entered in the relevant software to review:
