Gokuldas Tejpal Hospital, Complex Building,
Ministry, Mumbai- 400001.
The date: March 5, 2019.
Reference:
Letter from the Commissioner (Health Services) and Mission Director, National Health Mission, Mumbai No. 1st March, 2019.
The Proposal:
Some slums in the municipal area are deprived of health services due to their distance from the urban health primary centre. A proposal was submitted to the Central Government in the Project Implementation Plan (PIP) of 2019-20 for implementation of" Apna Dawakhana" scheme in 11 Municipal Corporations under Urban Health Mission (NUHM) to provide health services to such areas. Accordingly, the Central Government has sanctioned 60" Apna Dawakhanas." These clinics will provide basic curative and preventive as well as referral services to 5000 to 10000 slum population living far away from urban PHCs. However, the government is considering to name the hospital project as" Respected Balasaheb Thackeray Apna Dawakhana Project."
Government's decision:
In order to provide health services to the areas which are deprived of health services due to being away from the urban primary health center in the slum areas of the municipal corporation area, the government is giving approval to rename the project" Apna Dawakhana" to" Respected Balasaheb Thackeray Apna Dawakhana Project" to be implemented in the municipal areas under the National Urban Health Mission.
