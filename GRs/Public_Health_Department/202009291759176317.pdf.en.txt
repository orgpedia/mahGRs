have done. Considering the experience of the District Surgeons, the Department was faced with the following problems: 1) Adequate funds were not being made available for the construction of the new Medical College building, salaries and other expenses. The construction of the medical college continues for 8-10 years. The availability of facilities as per MCI norms takes a lot of financial allocation, which puts pressure on the hospital and the quality of patient care is not maintained.
(ii) Patients referred from rural hospitals/ sub-district hospitals/ primary health centres in the concerned district are not given priority admission in the medical college.
3) The Dean is not effectively implementing the programmes of the National Health Mission from the District Hospital and the funds of the National Health Mission are also not being spent.
4) The dual control leads to administrative chaos and affects the functioning of the hospital and in turn, the patients do not get good service.
5) Despite the creation of the post due to the availability of the staff of the Public Health Department, the College of Medical Education, the Dean has not been filling the post for years. Therefore, the public health department often faces the problem of low staffing.
The deputed staff of the health department at the medical college are not willing to work in rural areas, so they often make demands for the permanent inclusion of the staff in the medical education department.
7) After the construction of the medical college building, the original building is returned to the Public Health Department.
