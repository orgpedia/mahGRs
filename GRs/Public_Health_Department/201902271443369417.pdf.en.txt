The proposal-
Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana has been implemented in the state by the state government in line with the implementation of the National Health Scheme by the central government. Under this scheme, free treatment is being provided to the poor and needy patients. Health services are provided by the state government through sub-centres, primary health centres, rural hospitals, sub-district hospitals, district hospitals, trauma care units, women hospitals. Emergency ambulance service has been made available in the state under the National Health Mission.
The scheme was being implemented to provide subsidy to hospitals run by private NGOs keeping in view the immediate situation of health care. Grants to private NGOs were not the right of those organizations, but auxiliary grants were made available as an aid to the government. Therefore, the government was considering amending the government's decision to give subsidy to hospitals run by private NGOs.
