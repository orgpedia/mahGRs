The Government of Maharashtra
the Department of Public Health
Government Resolution No. Corona-2020/ P.S. 110/ Health-5,
Gokuldas Tejpal Hospital
The new building, Mumbai
Date of Birth: May 29, 2020
Reference: 1) The Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897.
The National Disaster Management Act, 2005.
The Bombay Police Act, 1951 and the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.
The Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement, Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Supply and Distribution) Act, 2003.
Government Decision No. Tobacco-2003/ P.S. No. 253/ Health-5 dated 02.04.2016.
(6) Central Government No. File No.Z. 21020/19/2020-TC, dated 10/4/2020.
7) Government of Maharashtra, Public Health Department Circular No. Tobacco-2014/ P. No. 159/ Health-5, Dy. 16/7/2014.
The Proposal:
According to Section 116 of the Bombay Police Act, 1951, spitting and smoking in public places is prohibited. Smoking in public places is prohibited under Section 4 of the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement, Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) Act, 2003. Commissioner of Food Safety, Food and Drug Administration, Maharashtra State Notification, Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, No. MSSA/ Notification/ 777-2013/7, dated 18th July, 2013 prohibits manufacture, stocking, distribution or sale of flavoured/ scented tobacco, flavoured/ scented betel nut in the interest of public health.
Although smoking and spitting in public places is prohibited under the above Act and penal action is taken through it, there seems to be no reduction in the incidence of spitting and smoking in public places. Spitting causes damage to public property and the administration is forced to spend tax paid by the public to re-paint the damaged walls.
Besides, it also poses a health hazard to the citizens and its ill-effects lead to spread of deadly diseases like cancer, respiratory diseases, reproductive system diseases, digestive system diseases as well as tuberculosis, swine flu, pneumonia etc. Now that it has been found that the infection of a pandemic like Covid is transmitted through spit, it is in the interest of all the people to take utmost care about it.
