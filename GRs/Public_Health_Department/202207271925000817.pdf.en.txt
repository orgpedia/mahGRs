Introduction: Read here. In exercise of the powers conferred by sub-rule (1) and (2) of rule 12 of the Maharashtra Civil Services (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1979, under the Government Orders and Memorandum No. 1, 2 and 3, charge sheets have been issued against a total of 9 officers/ employees for the irregularities committed in the purchase of laparoscope sets for Kandivali, Worli and Thane hospitals in 2007-08.
The Accountant General, Mumbai, objected to this. On perusal of the preliminary enquiry report dated 10.07.2010 of the then Director (Medical), State Workers Insurance Scheme, Mumbai and the statement of the appellants, the Government is of the view that it would not be appropriate to hold the staff concerned and the surgeon who examined the said set responsible for payment of the purchase price of the laparoscope set. Accordingly, the matter of withdrawal of charges against the concerned employees was under consideration of the government.
