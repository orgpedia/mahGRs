Administrative approval for installation of IoT based smart optimizer in hospitals under the Department of Public Health.
The Government of Maharashtra
the Department of Public Health
GOVERNMENT DECISION, NO.: SAMRICH 2022/ PR No.317/ HEALTH 3
10th floor of the building,
G.T. Hospital premises, Mumbai-400 001.
Date: August 10, 2023.
Note: 1) Letter from Joint Director, Health Services Hospitals State Level, Mumbai No. AASE/ Cell-3/ TE6/ Electricity/ Fire Protection/ 1499/23 dated 17.02.2023.
Introduction: In the health institutions under the Health Department, it is necessary to install IoT based smart optimizer to reduce the rate of fire due to shot circuit and electric shock to the patients. The construction of some health institutions under the Public Health Department is generally 30 to 35 years old. Similarly, with the modernization of health care, electrical equipment has been installed in the hospital. The possibility of fire cannot be ruled out as the electrical equipment creates more or less pressure in the electric current.
For this purpose, IOT based smart optimizers will be installed in district hospitals, sub-district hospitals, women hospitals, rural hospitals, trauma care units etc. 33,70,14, 538/- was under consideration of the Government for grant of administrative approval.
Government Decision: Under the Public Health Department, a pilot is being approved to install IoT based smart optimizer in district hospitals, sub-district hospitals, women hospitals, rural hospitals, and trauma care units etc.
The said budget has been prepared by the Deputy Engineer (Electrical), Public Works Department and certified by the Assistant Chief Engineer (Electrical), Chief Engineer (Electrical), Public Works Department, Mumbai. The budget includes 18 per cent GST and 4 per cent contingency spending.
