Mumbai: The number of Covid-19 cases in the country is increasing at an alarming rate. Also, the Covid positivity rate has increased from 25 to 30%. Similarly, the number of infected persons also increases. Therefore, it is very important to conduct RT-PCR tests of as many suspects as possible as soon as possible and make the report available within 24 hours. This will help to avoid such a situation. At present, about 80,000 tests/ day are being done by the government's 72 RTPCR labs in the state. However, it needs to be increased to 30,000 tests per day. At present, 60% of the total tests are done through RT-PCR process, and up to 80% of the tests need to be done through RT-PCR.
RTPCR labs are also functioning at their maximum capacity. Due to the increase in the number of suspects and the manpower, kits and other aspects of the working laboratory, as well as the load of tests on them, RTPCR tests are required to be done by collecting RTPCR mobile labs and samples.
