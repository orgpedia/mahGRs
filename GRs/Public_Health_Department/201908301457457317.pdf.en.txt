Published on June 24, 2015. It is expected to provide trained manpower by setting up and strengthening PG departments in Mental Health Specialities Scheme-B by setting up Centres of Excellence to start mental health courses in places where mental health infrastructure is available.
Role of Centre of Excellence: The following courses/ batches are proposed to be introduced to fill the shortage of skilled mental health workers and specialists for providing mental health services.
Benefits of Diploma in Psychiatric Nursing Scheme: The funds received under the scheme will be used for improving the infrastructure of regional psychiatric hospitals and providing expert manpower related to mental health services in the state.
