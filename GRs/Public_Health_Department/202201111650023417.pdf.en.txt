Government Order- Bonds were being taken from the principals who were undergoing training and passing out in the Government Nurses College. The bond was in the form of a National Savings Certificate of Rs 2500 in their name from the trainee concerned. Free education is being provided in government schools. After passing the course, the trainee had to register with the Maharashtra Nursing Council and serve 18 months in a government health institution. This is an 18-month
Therefore, during the given service period, they were paid full salary as per the pay scale of the parochial cadre in the given situation and importantly, the bond did not guarantee government service. However, court cases had arisen demanding that government service was a right only as a bonded labourer despite being paid full salary during the bonded service period. In view of the above, in the circumstances, till the date of notification of the Service Entry Rules, as provided in the Service Entry Rules, i.e. The services of Bonded Labourers in service as on 15.04.2015 have been regularized by conducting written examination (as per the provisions of the Entry into Service Rules). Also, reference No. By issuing the Government Decision mentioned in Reference No. 1, it has been stopped to take the bond from the academic year 2019-20. According to the government decision mentioned in section 2, the address of the bonded officer has also been closed due to cancellation and the government has decided to take the services of any officer on a contractual basis for a period of 6 months without calling the bonded officer.
No officer of the Board after 15.04.2015 shall be deemed to be a Bonded Officer. However, despite all the above government decisions being self-explanatory, in some circles, instead of giving appointment on contractual basis, contracts of more than 6 months up to 18 months with the address of the bonded officer are being issued.
