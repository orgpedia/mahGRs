Read- 1) Letter from the Commissioner of Health Services No. Organ Donation/ Task Force/ Cell- 20/21 dated 29.12.2021
Introduction: Maharashtra has been at the top in organ donation since 2019. Mumbai and Pune are two of the biggest cities in the country. Compared to other cities in the state, the rate of organ donation is less. The main reason for this is the misunderstanding among the relatives of the patients regarding organ donation, lack of specialist manpower, etc. The matter of forming a special task force in order to overcome these difficulties and increase organ donation was under the consideration of the government.
Government Decision As per the decision of the Government, a special task force has been formed to streamline the entire process of organ donation and organ transplantation. It is being constituted under the chairmanship of the Minister of Public Health and Family Welfare.
