The Proposal:
Considering the urgency of day-to-day functioning of the Department of Parliamentary Affairs and the functioning of the Legislative Assembly, a proposal to procure 3 multifunction printers for the Department of Parliamentary Affairs was under consideration. Accordingly, as per the guidelines issued under the Government Decision No. 2 in the context of the Department of Industry, Energy and Labor, the registration for the purchase of 3 multifunction printers was done from the Government e-Marketplace portal of the Central Government. Accordingly, a supplier with the lowest L-1 rate was selected from among the suppliers and an order was placed with them for supply of the said goods. However, due to the inability of the said supplier to supply the goods as per the demand, fresh procurement process needs to be initiated on the Government e-Marketplace portal. Meanwhile, it has been decided to procure 3 single function printers instead of 3 multifunction printers for the department. Therefore, the Government decision issued at the reference serial number 4 is required to be cancelled and subject to the policy set by the Department of Industry, Energy and Labour as mentioned above, the process of procurement of 3 printers required for the Department of Parliamentary Affairs and administrative and financial approval for the same is under consideration.
GOVERNOR'S DECISION: In view of the above mentioned in the Preamble, the Government Resolution dated 31st July, 2019, dated 4th July, 2019, under reference to the Department of Parliamentary Affairs, stands cancelled.
(ii) In view of the urgency of day-to-day functioning of the Department of Parliamentary Affairs and the functioning of the Legislative Assembly, the Department of Parliamentary Affairs has been accorded administrative and financial approval for procurement of 3 Single Function Printers through Government e-Marketplace (GeM) portal by adopting the prescribed procedure.
