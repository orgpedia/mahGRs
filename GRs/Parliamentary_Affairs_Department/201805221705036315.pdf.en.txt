GOVERNMENT Circular: The 8th Report of the Assurance Committee of the Legislative Assembly on the promises made during the 2nd (Monsoon Session) of 2014 has been tabled in the Legislative Assembly on 27th March, 2018. The Assembly Assurance Committee in its report has made some recommendations with feedback comments in line with the fulfillment of the promises made by various departments. A summary of these are as follows:
1) The administrative departments are required to submit the information of fulfillment of promises within the stipulated time i.e. 90 days. In cases where there are judicial obstacles or
The government should also bring to the notice of the committee that there are some problems regarding fulfillment. Therefore, the government should take a comprehensive decision and fix responsibility on the Deputy Secretary and Joint Secretary of the concerned department for the fulfillment of these promises and take concrete action against such officials if there is a deliberate delay in the fulfillment of the promise. Also, every three months, the department heads of the concerned departments, i.e., the Secretary/ Principal Secretary, along with the concerned Deputy Secretary/ Joint Secretary of their departments, hold review meetings on the fulfillment of the promises. The Minister should expeditiously and expeditiously take a decision on the promises made in the House and send the report to the House through the Department of Parliamentary Affairs.

The Committee is of the firm view that if the responsibility is fixed on the concerned officers, most of the promises can be fulfilled on time and even before time. Therefore, the government should formulate a strict policy to place the statement of promises on the table of the House within the prescribed time. The government should take a comprehensive decision to take disciplinary action against the officers of the rank of Deputy Secretary/ Joint Secretary of the concerned department who deliberately and deliberately delay the fulfillment of the promises and immediately issue a circular in this regard and submit a report to the committee within a month. Also, the administrative departments need to take care of the coherent and complete action in cases where it is possible to expedite the process of fulfillment of promises in accordance with the subject and content of the promises. The report of such action should be sent to the committee within one month.
(3) In the statement to be placed before the Committee on the fulfillment of the promises by the Department of the Ministry, the subject of the promises, the assurances given by the Minister/ Minister of State in the House and the action taken by the Department are mentioned.
A lot of the time there are differences and contradictions. There is also a difference in the content of promises and their fulfillment. This means that the officials concerned are hurriedly fulfilling the promises before the committee to kill time.
The fulfillment of promises must be consistent and complete in relation to the subject.
The Committee takes serious note of the errors found during the first reading of the minutes of the Committee meeting. The Minister should ensure that the promises made in the House are consistent and within the scope of the promises made and the Government should issue all circulars in this regard immediately and take immediate action in this regard and submit a report to the Committee on the action taken in this regard within one month.
2. The Committee on Assurances in its report has specifically recommended to draw the attention of the Administrative Departments to the fact that the attendance before the Committee in respect of the testimony of the Ministerial Departments is not being followed seriously by the responsible officers (Principal Secretary/ Secretary) of the concerned Departments.
Special recommendations:
The concerned Additional Chief Secretary/ Principal Secretary/ Secretary is to be present at the time of the deposition of the departments conducted by the Assurance Committee. In case of unavoidable circumstances, the Committee

If it is not possible to attend the proceedings, it is necessary to inform the committee three days in advance. However, most of the officers report their absence to the Committee on time and the subordinate officers (Joint Secretary/ Deputy Secretary) are asked to appear before the Committee instead.
They are not getting the required information for the work of the committee. Therefore, the meeting had to be postponed. As a result, the committee has expressed strong disapproval as the number of pending works before the committee is increasing. In view of the unique importance of committees in a parliamentary democracy, it is necessary for the officers of the State Government to appear before the Committee and assist the Committee in its functioning by giving appropriate replies in respect of the proceedings of the Committee.
Therefore, the committee is assured that the information assured in the meeting will be submitted within the stipulated time without giving satisfactory answers to the committee. The committee has made a special recommendation that the Chief Secretary of the government should give strict instructions to all the departments so that the officers of the concerned department come before the committee with complete information about the relevant promises.
In pursuance of the recommendations made by the Assurance Committee of the Legislative Assembly, the Department has already issued instructions to all the Ministries/ Departments from time to time under Circular No. 1, as the case may be. However, the Secretaries of all the Ministries/ Departments should ensure that the above recommendations of the Assurance Committee directed in its 8th Report are seriously complied with and action taken report should be submitted to the Committee within one month.
