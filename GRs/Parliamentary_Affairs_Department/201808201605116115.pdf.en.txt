The Committee is of the firm view that the promises can be fulfilled in time and even before time.

A report to the Committee on 1
be sent in a month.
(iii) The matters to be dealt with in the statement of undertaking to be placed before the Committee by the Ministries/ Departments, the assurances given by the Minister/ Minister of State in the House and the action taken by the Department.
A lot of times there are contradictions and contradictions. There is also a difference in the content of promises and their fulfillment. This means that the officials concerned are hurriedly fulfilling the promises before the committee to kill time. The fulfillment of promises must be consistent and complete in relation to the subject. The Committee takes serious note of the errors found during the first reading of the minutes of the Committee meeting. The Minister should ensure that the promises made in the House are consistent and within the scope of the promises made and the Government should issue a comprehensive circular in this regard immediately and take immediate action in this regard and submit a report to the Committee on the action taken in this regard within one month.
In pursuance of the recommendations made by the Assurance Committee of the Legislative Assembly, instructions have been issued by the Department to all the Ministries/ Departments from time to time vide Circular No. 1 and 2 respectively. However, the Secretaries of all the Ministries/ Departments should ensure strict compliance of the above mentioned recommendations of the Assurance Committee of the Legislative Assembly in its Ninth Report and submit the action taken report to the Committee within one month.
Come.
