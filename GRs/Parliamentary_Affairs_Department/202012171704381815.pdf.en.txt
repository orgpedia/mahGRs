Read: Government Resolution, General Administration Department, No.Shapse-3420/ PR No. 54/ K.A.31, dated 10th August, 2020 Preamble:
The functioning of the Department of Parliamentary Affairs is different from that of other Ministries. It coordinates the work of the Maharashtra Legislature between the Legislature Secretariat and the Ministerial Administrative Department. Considering the nature of the work of this department, there is an absolute need for the department to have a vehicle available for urgent and time-bound work. However, no staff cars have been approved for this department. Also, the post of driver is not included in the sanctioned posts of this department. Therefore, instead of sanctioning and procuring a staff car for the department, it was contemplated to allow the vehicle to be made available on lease from the identified supplier at a rate to be determined by the Government in terms of the General Administration Department and at a rate to be determined from time to time.
GOVERNMENT DECISION: In pursuance of the proposal submitted by this Department in the background mentioned in the above introduction, the Finance Department has sanctioned a staff car for the immediate and time-bound functioning of this Department and has approved the purchase of a sanctioned car and making available the vehicle on rent as per the decision of the Government in the context of the General Administration Department. Accordingly, a vehicle will be made available on lease for the operation of this department as per the government decision issued on August 10, 2020 under the General Administration Department and issued from time to time thereafter.
The expenditure for this purpose shall be met from the grant sanctioned for that financial year under the head Demand No.P-1, Head of Accounts 2052-Secretariat-General Services, 090-Secretariat, (00) (01) Department of Parliamentary Affairs (Mandatory), Indicator (2052 0268), 13, Office Expenditure.
The said Government Decision is being issued pursuant to the concurrence received under the Informal Reference No. 265/ 2020/ Regulations dated 17th September, 2020 of the Department of Finance.
