Government circular:
The Eleventh Report of the Committee on Assurances for the Fourth (Winter) Session of 2014 has been tabled in the Legislative Assembly on 28th February, 2019.
The Assembly Assurances Committee in its report has made some recommendations with feedback comments in line with the fulfillment of the assurances made by various departments of the Ministry. A summary of these are as follows:
The administrative departments are required to submit the information regarding the fulfillment of the promises within the stipulated time i.e. 90 days. However, the Committee did not find much improvement in the implementation of the promises made by the Government despite bringing them to the notice of the Government from time to time through various reports. However, in view of the inexcusable delay in this regard by the officers, the responsibility should be fixed on the concerned officer and the government should formulate a strict policy in this regard and take a comprehensive decision to fulfill the promises within 90 days in any case, and the responsibility should be fixed on the Deputy Secretary and Joint Secretary of the concerned department in the fulfillment of these promises.
The promises which can be easily fulfilled by the department heads of the concerned departments by holding review meetings with the concerned Deputy Secretary/ Joint Secretary of the department every three months to ensure speedy and timely settlement of the promises. A decision in this regard should be taken at the earliest and the statement of assurance should be sent to the Department of Parliamentary Affairs for placing it on the table of the House. The committee has to submit its report within a month's time. If there is any deliberate delay in this regard, a decision should be taken to take strict action against such officials.

3) In the House of Representatives. The objective is to table the statement of fulfillment of the assurances in the ensuing session after the assurance is given by the Minister and as per the rules of the Legislative Assembly, the time limit for the fulfillment of the assurances is 90 days. To ensure that this limit is not violated under any circumstances, the assurances can be fulfilled in time if the responsibility is fixed on the officers of the rank of Deputy Secretary/ Joint Secretary of the concerned department. The Ministries/ Departments shall, while forwarding the fulfillment of the assurances to the Department of Parliamentary Affairs, take the statements in soft copy and submit the same to the Department of Parliamentary Affairs, and the Department of Parliamentary Affairs shall take the fulfillment of all such assurances collected together in soft copy and submit the same to the Legislature along with the action taken statement regarding the fulfillment of the year-wise and session-wise assurances to be placed before it by the Government from time to time.
4) Subjects of the assurances in the statement to be placed before the Committee by the Ministries/ Departments regarding the fulfillment of the assurances. There are often discrepancies and discrepancies in the assurances given by the Minister/ Minister of State in the House and the action taken by the Department. There is also a difference in the content of promises and their fulfillment. This means that the officials concerned are hurriedly fulfilling the promises before the committee to kill time. The fulfillment of promises must be consistent and complete in relation to the subject. The Committee takes serious note of the errors found during the first reading of the minutes of the Committee meeting. The Minister shall ensure compliance with the promises made in the House and the scope of the promises. The committee is of the view that the government should formulate a strict policy to place the statement of promises on the table of the House within the prescribed time. Despite all this, if there is any delay and dereliction of duty by the officers of the rank of Deputy Secretary/ Joint Secretary of the concerned department, then disciplinary action should be taken against the officer by taking a comprehensive decision and a circular should be issued immediately and a report should be submitted to the Assembly Assurance Committee within a month.
2. In pursuance of the recommendations of the Assurance Committee of the Legislative Assembly. Instructions have already been issued from the level of Chief Secretary as well as from the Department of Parliamentary Affairs to all the Ministries/ Departments from time to time, vide Circular No. 1 and 2 respectively. However, the Secretaries of all the Ministries/ Departments should ensure strict compliance of the above mentioned recommendations made by the Assurance Committee in its Eleventh Report and submit the action taken report to the Committee within one month.
