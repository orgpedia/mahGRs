Government circular:
The Tenth Report of the Assurance Committee on the pending Assurances of the Fourth (Winter) Session of 2014 has been tabled in the Legislative Assembly on 30th November, 2018. The Assembly Assurances Committee in its report has made some general as well as special recommendations with feedback comments in line with the fulfillment of the assurances made by various departments of the Ministry. A summary of these are as follows:
General recommendations:
The administrative departments are required to submit the information regarding the fulfillment of the promises within the stipulated time i.e. 90 days. However, the Committee did not find much improvement in the implementation of the promises made by the Government despite bringing them to the notice of the Government from time to time through various reports. However, due to the ineffable delay in this matter by the officers, the responsibility is fixed on the concerned officer and the government has made a strict policy in this regard and the government has taken a comprehensive decision to fulfill the promises within 90 days in any case, by fixing the responsibility on the Deputy Secretary and Joint Secretary of the concerned department for the fulfillment of these promises.

GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: VISA- 2018/377/ P.No.166/ VI
Strict action should be taken against such officials.
The promises which can be easily fulfilled by the department heads of the concerned departments by holding review meetings with the concerned Deputy Secretary/ Joint Secretary of the department every three months to ensure speedy and timely settlement of the promises. In such a case, a quick decision should be taken and the statement of assurance in this regard should be sent to the Department of Parliamentary Affairs to place it on the table of the House. The committee has to submit its report within a month's time. If there is any deliberate delay in this regard, a decision should be taken to take strict action against such officials.
3) The Department concerned shall submit to the Department of Parliamentary Affairs, the fulfillment of the promises to the Department of Parliamentary Affairs by taking 40 hard copies of the fulfillment of each promise as well as the returns in" soft copy" and submit it to the Legislature. Also in the House. The objective is to place the statement of fulfillment of the assurances on the table of the House in the ensuing session after the assurance is given by the Minister and as per the rules of the Legislative Assembly, the time limit for the fulfillment of the assurances is 90 days. To ensure that this limit is not violated under any circumstances, the assurances can be fulfilled in time if the responsibility is fixed on the officers of the rank of Deputy Secretary/ Joint Secretary of the concerned department. The committee is of the view that the government should formulate a strict policy to place the statement of promises on the table of the House within the prescribed time. Despite all this, if there is any delay and dereliction of duty by the officers of the rank of Deputy Secretary/ Joint Secretary of the concerned department, then disciplinary action should be taken against the officer by taking a comprehensive decision and a circular should be issued immediately and a report should be submitted to the Assembly Assurance Committee within a month.
Special recommendations:
the concerned Divisional Secretary/ Principal Secretary at the time of the testimony of the Divisional Secretary
They are often absent or unavailable to testify before the committee for one reason or another. In their absence, officers of the rank of Joint Secretary/ Deputy Secretary/ Under Secretary in their department are asked to appear for deposition. Since such officers are unable to give complete information before the committee, the committee has to postpone the meetings without a decision. The committee expressed its strong displeasure on page 2 of 4

GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: VISA- 2018/377/ P.No.166/ VI
The report has strongly disapproved of the role of the concerned government officials. In view of the unique nature of Committees in a Parliamentary democracy, while the officers of the State Government are bound to answer all the questions of the Committee, it is assured that the information assured in the Committee meeting will not be furnished within the stipulated time and the information will be presented before the Committee without a satisfactory answer. Therefore, the Assurance Committee has made a special recommendation that the Chief Secretary of the government should give strict instructions to all the departments in a letter so that the officers of the concerned department should be present with complete information about the relevant assurances when they come before the committee.
In pursuance of the recommendations made by the Assurance Committee of the Legislative Assembly, clear instructions have been issued by the Department to all the Ministries/ Departments from time to time, vide Circular No. 1, 3 and 4 respectively. However, the Secretaries of all the Ministries/ Departments shall ensure strict compliance of the aforesaid general and special recommendations made by the Assurance Committee of the Legislative Assembly in its Tenth Report.
The information should be submitted to the Maharashtra Legislature Secretariat in the prescribed form by each department within the prescribed time.
In the Legislative Assembly. In view of the content of the assurances given by the Minister/ Minister of State, if the Assembly promise cannot be fulfilled due to some unavoidable reason and it is to be omitted, the Minister of the concerned department with appropriate justification for the omission of the assurance.
Minister or Minister. Signed by Minister of State. The request should be made to the head of the committee, the Assembly Assurances Committee within the prescribed period (90 days) and after the committee approves it, the report should be sent to the Department of Parliamentary Affairs. Further, in cases where it is not possible to fulfil the promises within the prescribed time period i.e. 90 days due to unavoidable reasons, the matter should be brought to the notice of the concerned Assurance Committee with proper explanation and an extension of time should be sought from them to send the information.
3. All the Ministries/ Departments may kindly take care to ensure strict compliance of the above directions.
