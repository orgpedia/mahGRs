Government circular
Former members of the Maharashtra Legislative Council are entitled to free rail travel with a companion for a total of 35,000 km in the state and outside the state every year. The facility of air travel in lieu of rail travel is permissible subject to ceiling of cost and other prescribed conditions. They are required to submit the reimbursement of the said journey to the concerned treasury within the prescribed time limit of three months.
It has come to the notice of the Government that in some cases, the reimbursement of the said journey by the former members is not being submitted to the concerned treasury within the prescribed period of three months.
Often, in case of delayed payments, the reasons for delay in such cases are not justified or relevant. And so they're rejected. In 2020 and 2021, several former legislators had mutually requested this department and the concerned district treasury office to condone the delay in submission of payments for their travel expenses. At that time, most of the members had cited the reason that" Government offices were closed due to the lockdown imposed by the Government of India in the context of COVID-19 pandemic." Further, the Government Resolution dated 08.06.2000 under reference stipulates that the payments should be made within 3 months from the date of travel. However, the payments for these trips are being introduced after a period of one year.

Proposals should not be sent to the government without attaching such certificates. No such proposal will be considered. Such proposals will be returned immediately.
All former members of the Maharashtra Legislature shall, in accordance with the conditions contained in paragraph 2 (a) of the Government Resolution dated 8th June, 2000, referred to in the said behalf, take care to make a demand for reimbursement to the Treasury Office within three months from the date of travel.
