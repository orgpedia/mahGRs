Further, during the deposition of the Ministries before the Committees on Fulfilment of Assurances, it has been observed that the assurances remain pending for a long time due to lack of timely action on the transfer of assurances. Also, the concerned secretaries and officers could not give complete and satisfactory answers to the questions asked by the members of the committee during the testimony before the committee. Some departments mislead the committee by giving evasive answers to many promises. The committee expressed its dissatisfaction over the issue.
