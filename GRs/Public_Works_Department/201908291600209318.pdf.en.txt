Read :-1. Collector, Gadchiroli letter no. Jinis/Gad/SANS-2/Naxal/BRO/2019/201, dated 14.12.2017.
Introduction : Gadchiroli district is a very remote, highly sensitive Naxal affected district and 78% of the district is under forest cover. The tribal population in the district is 38.71% and there are 1513 villages in the district.
The geographical area of the district is large and there are a large number of tribal padas and villages with very low population. It is essential to connect them with a perennial road. But Naxal influence is more visible in this area. Naxal influence and anti-social activities cause inordinate delays in construction of roads and bridges and provision of other basic development facilities.
In this district, in 1989, under the Special Action Program, a program was implemented to build roads and bridges to connect every village with perennial roads. But due to Naxal activities, the works under the said scheme could not be completed even after a long period of time. After that, the administration decided to enter into an MoU with BRO (Border Road Organization) to carry out road and bridge works. Accordingly, BRO did the road and bridge works till the year 2010 and after that showed inability to do the works.
After this, however, road and bridge works are being implemented in the district only through the Public Works Department. But in the current situation, roads in remote/very remote and Naxalite areas get very little response from contractors. Therefore, it has been seen that the works of roads and bridges have not started in the places where the Naxal influence is the most. Chhattisgarh administration has formed a &quot;District Construction Committee&quot; to solve such problems. On the same lines, the matter of forming a &quot;District Construction Committee&quot; to carry out road and bridge works in remote and Naxal-affected areas of Gadchiroli district was under consideration of the government.
Government Decision: &quot;District Construction Committee&quot; is being formed to complete the works of roads and bridges in remote and Naxal affected areas in Gadchiroli district. The composition of the present committee will be as follows.
1) Collector, Gadchiroli : Chairman 2) Superintending Engineer, S.B. Mandal, Gadchiroli :- Member 3) Superintendent of Police, Gadchiroli : Member 4) District Forest Officer, Gadchiroli : Member 5) District Treasury Officer, Gadchiroli : Member 6) Concerned Executive Engineer, Civil Department :- Member Secretary
