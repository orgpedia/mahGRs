Introduction:
Before the Maharashtra Highways Act, 1955, the road network in Maharashtra was built according to the British system. The width of the roads was considered according to the maps of villages made during the British era. Also the status of State Highways, Major District Roads, Rural Roads etc. was given keeping in mind the villages, towns, traffic intensity and determining the importance of the road. Similarly, carriageway width, road width, bridge width were determined. At that time the First Road Development Plan 1943-1963 was prepared taking into consideration the maps of villages and the public use of roads.
This means that before the Maharashtra Highways Act, 1955 came into existence, roads were being planned keeping these things in mind. Therefore, the task of determining the boundaries of road widening and publishing the highway maps was not done by the National Highways. Also, the boundaries of all other group-survey numbers were determined by keeping the road boundaries shown in the village map as standard. After the implementation of the Maharashtra Highways Act, 1955, action was expected to take place regarding delimitation and maps of highways as per Section 7 and 8 of the said Act. However, due to non-promulgation of other rules regarding the Maharashtra Highways Act, 1955 or other similar reasons, it is seen that the said action is not taking place. Also, the method of considering the village map as standard, which was in use earlier, was continued.
Hon. Writ Petition No. 177/2021 and other petitions are filed in Bombay High Court. In the said petitions, issues related to the boundary of the highway have been raised. Hon. The High Court by its order dated 14.10.2022 has asked the State Government to file an affidavit regarding whether the provisions of Section 7 and 8 of the Maharashtra Highways Act, 1955 are being followed. The State Government through an affidavit dated 06.01.2023 in this regard
