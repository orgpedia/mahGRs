Introduction: Due to industrial progress in the vicinity of Pune city and increasing urbanization, the existing road network for Pune city is now becoming inadequate. Vehicles coming and going from Kolhapur, Saswad, Solapur, Ahmednagar, Nashik, Mangaon, Konkan and Mumbai have to pass through the city. Due to this, it is putting a strain on the roads within the city. As such incoming and outgoing vehicles have to pass through the city, it affects the internal roads as well and due to this, air and noise pollution has increased in the city, traffic jams are occurring and the development of the city has been hampered.
Therefore, it is necessary to build a ring road outside the city to divert these vehicles to the right direction without bringing them inside the city, so a decision was taken on behalf of the government to build a ring road around the city of Pune.
Pune city is growing rapidly in urbanization. Pune city has taken the lead in the country in the field of education, IT and auto industry. Three important national highways pass through the city of Pune: Mumbai-Bangalore, Mumbai-Hyderabad-Vijayawada, Pune-Nashik, Pune-Pandharpur, Pune-Aurangabad, Pune-Mangaon national highways. All types of inter-state traffic as well as intra-state traffic pass through the interior of the city as there is no ring road. Due to the lack of major wide roads within the city and narrow internal roads, this increased traffic volume is beyond the carrying capacity. Due to the dense population of the city as well as the specific geographical structure, there are limitations to widening the roads. Due to mixed traffic in the city, air and noise pollution has increased beyond the limit. The problem of traffic accidents and vehicle parking is faced. For this, all types of traffic coming to Pune city must be diverted from outside the city through Ring Road. Accordingly, the Government has taken the following decision in the meeting of the Cabinet Infrastructure Committee held on 25.08.2021.
