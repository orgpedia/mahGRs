Introduction: Hindu Hriday Samrat Balasaheb Thackeray Maharashtra Samruddhi Highway, the state's ambitious project to connect the state capital Mumbai and the deputy capital Nagpur, has been completed and opened for traffic. The rest of the route will be opened soon. With a view to connecting the eastern and western borders of the State of Maharashtra through Shigar Sanchar Expressway, it is planned to extend the Hindu Hriday Samrat Balasaheb Thackeray Maharashtra Samruddhi Mahamarg from Nagpur to Bhandara to Gadchiroli.
The development of the Bhandara-Gadchiroli Access Controlled Rapid Transit Expressway is one of the major development projects in Eastern Maharashtra and its main objectives are as follows: i. Connecting Nagpur city with Gadchiroli, Bhandara and Mumbai ahead by access controlled expressway.
(ii) To connect the eastern and western borders of the State by an expressway.
(iii) Inter-State connectivity through expressways with the States of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Orissa and West Bengal etc.
The inter-state passenger and freight traffic will help in improving the viability of the Hindu Hriday Samrat Balasaheb Thackeray Maharashtra Samruddhi Mahamarg.

This will connect the underdeveloped and tribal areas of the eastern part of the state with the mainstream and will help in the social and economic development of the area, boost new industries and create a large number of jobs.
