Government Resolution No: SANKIRN-2023/ P.S. NO. 11/ MEANING-2
Ministry, (Main Building) 4th Floor, Madame Cama Street,
Hutatma Rajguru Chowk, Mumbai- 400 032
Date: December 20, 2023
NOTE NO. TM/ GR.|/ UOR-27/ 12 dated 13.04.2023 of the Office of the Accountant General (Accounts and Accounts), Maharashtra-II, Nagpur Preamble:
The government quarters in Bandra are used by most of the government officials/ employees working in the state capital as per their availability. Since the rent of private buildings in Mumbai is relatively high, most of the employees prefer to stay in government accommodation in Bandra. Therefore, there is a constant use of available residential buildings. As a result, the buildings are constantly being repaired and maintained. Since these government residences are located in the central part of the state capital, maintaining cleanliness and hygiene of the buildings and premises is of unique general importance. The building is about 50 years old. The buildings have been damaged due to heavy rains, floods and storms in the last four to five years. As a result, a lot of maintenance work needs to be done on the building. However, due to lack of funds, the construction work could not be taken up.
Considering the above facts, if funds are made available in a specific concrete form for the repair and conservation of government buildings in Bandra, the life of the buildings there will increase. Therefore, it is not necessary to make frequent repairs on these buildings. The government accommodation in the center of the city will be clean, beautiful and tidy, so that the people will see the good work of the state government. At present, funds are provided to the Superintending Engineer, Public Works Board, Mumbai for the repair and maintenance of these buildings. There are four other Sub-Divisions under the Superintending Engineer, Public Works Board, Mumbai and they are mainly Mantralaya, Raj Bhavan, Vidhan Bhavan, Ma. Since the maintenance and upkeep of important buildings such as residences and offices of Ministers, court buildings and residences etc. are covered, most of the funds available are to be spent on priority for maintenance and repair of these buildings. Therefore, very little funds are available for government accommodation in Bandra. Therefore, it is necessary to make a separate accounting for the maintenance and repair of residential and office buildings in Bandra and make a provision in the budget for it. The government was considering the issue of creating a new head of account for this fund in the budget.
