The vacancies are for the posts of Assistant Executive Engineer, Assistant Engineer Grade 1, Deputy Divisional Engineer and Deputy Divisional Officer. However, if there was no eligible officer available to fill the vacancy in one cadre, the post was filled by giving temporary promotion to an officer of another cadre. In order to ensure smooth functioning of the administration, the promotions were made in the absence of the prevailing situation. This promotion was very temporary. Explanation ii to Rule 4 (2) and Rule 5 (2) (b) of the Government Notification dated 7.4.1983 clearly provide that such period of service of engineers promoted in absentia shall not be considered for seniority. 281/ 12, dated 21.6.2021, Rule 3 (3) (a) of the M.N.S. (Regulation of Seniority) Rules, 2021 provides for a similar format. Such ad-hoc promoted officers have been accommodated in the said Seniority List in the year the post became available to them in their cadre, taking into account their seniority in the lower cadre. Also, the order of regular promotion of the concerned officers has been taken into account while indicating the position in the said seniority list. Thus, the period of service of the officers promoted in absentia has not been taken into account for seniority.
3. Reference No. The cadre numbers of the Executive Engineer cadre mentioned in the Government Decision 5 to 10 have been prepared taking into consideration. Also, the number of Executive Engineer Cadre for the year 2017 has not been announced. Therefore, the number of the year 2016 has been taken into account for the year 2017.
4. This seniority list is decided by the government. The Rules of Promotion of the post of Executive Engineer dated 19.12.1970 and the Rules issued for determining the seniority of this cadre. The Service Entry Rules, dated 7.4.1983, have been framed taking into account the provisions of the M.N.S. (Regulation of Seniority) Rules, 2021.
Further, while determining the position in the said seniority list, the date of seniority of the said engineers has been provided as per Rule 4 (2) of the Government Notification dated 7.4.1983.
