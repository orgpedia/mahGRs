Government Decision No: Sink-2024 / P.S. No.64 / Earth-2
Mantralaya, (Main Building) 4th Floor, Madame Cama Marg,
Martyr Rajguru Chowk, Mumbai - 400 032
Date: May 16, 2025
Read: - Letter No. No. TM / GR1] / UOR- 33/2025-26 dated 09.04.2025 from the Office of the Accountant General (Accounts & Licensure), Maharashtra-], Nagpur
The Proposal: -
The state has high court benches, district courts, as well as various other court buildings.
Annual maintenance repairs to these buildings require a large amount of funding. Courts are very important buildings in the state and if any maintenance or repair work arises in these buildings, this work has to be done on priority. Regular maintenance and repairs of buildings extend the life of the buildings. Adequate funds for these works should be made available immediately. The government is periodically directed by the court. These buildings hold documents, evidence, and other important documents related to various court cases, so they need to be protected.
Presently, preservation repair of court buildings is done only from the headings of accounts available for preservation repair of government non-residential buildings. However, the government has a larger liability for maintenance and repair of non-residential buildings compared to the budgeted provision.
Considering the large-scale liability of maintenance repair of non-residential buildings and the urgency of regular maintenance repair of court buildings, the issue of creation of a separate head of accounts for maintenance and repair of court buildings was under consideration of the government.
The government's decision:
The Government is approving the creation of a new title of account for the purpose of "Maintenance and Repair of Court Buildings" in the State as follows:
Preservation and Repair of Court Buildings in the State: -
