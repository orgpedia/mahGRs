Introduction
A committee was formed under the chairmanship of the then Principal Secretary Shri.Bakshi to remove the bottleneck in the promotion of engineers in the existing structure of engineering cadre in Public Works and Water Resources Department. The committee has submitted its recommendations to the government regarding the structure of both these departments. These recommendations have been continuously discussed in the Public Works and Water Resources Department. According to the overall discussion, taking into account the working nature of both these departments, each department should decide on the structural changes at the level of that department. Apart from this, the process of preparing cadre-wise service entry rules in Public Works and Water Resources Department has been done at the level of Water Resources Department with the approval of Public Works Department. If any change is to be made in this integrated service entry rule regarding service matters from the point of view of the engineers of this department, both the administrative departments have to depend on each other and this leads to wastage of time.
Apart from this, the General Administration Department in the meetings dated 29.3.2019 and 14.5.2019 also gave instructions that the entry rules for the technical cadre in the Public Works Department and the Water Resources Department are very old, and both these departments have given instructions that it will be necessary to prepare the entry rules for the cadre wise administrative department. are Considering this matter, it is necessary for the public works department to determine the service entry rules of the working cadre in this structure from the perspective of how the technical structure of the department should be. In accordance with that, to eliminate the frustration in the promotion of engineers in the technical cadre and to make the work of the department more efficient, by determining the structure of the department, the issue of setting up a committee to prepare cadre-wise service entry rules was under the consideration of the government.
