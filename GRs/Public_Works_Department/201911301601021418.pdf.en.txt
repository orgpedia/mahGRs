Corrigendum: Please refer to Date of Serial No. Refer to Government Circular dated 17th September, 2019. In this Circular Notice No. 4 is being amended as follows: Notification no. The last sentence in 4 “If it is not possible to include the necessary condition in the Correction Addendum or CSD, then the tender process should be completed without that condition. Under no circumstances should the tender process be cancelled” is omitted. Instead the sentence has been amended as follows.
&quot;If the instructions approved by the Government or competent authority are to be included in the uploaded tender form by mistake/inadvertence, such instructions should be extended by extending the tender acceptance period and the terms and conditions should be included in the tender form only after that the tender process should be carried out.&quot;
Other instructions in circular no. No change from 1 to 13.
If the tender is opened without including the important terms and conditions approved by the Government, it will be considered unacceptable. The Superintending Engineer should ensure that all the terms and conditions have been included and only after that Tender Envelope No.1 is opened and after submitting such certificate to the Chief Engineer, Tender Envelope No.2 should be opened with the permission of the Chief Engineer. main

The Engineer should ensure that the uploaded tender form as well as the terms and conditions approved under various government decisions and orders are included in the tender form and record it in the records and allow the financial envelope to be opened only later. Otherwise, the tender case should be canceled and a new tender should be invited.
The chief engineer should strongly warn the authorities from whom the important terms and conditions have remained to be included in the tender form.
