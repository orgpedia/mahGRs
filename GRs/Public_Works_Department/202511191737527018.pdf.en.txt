Government Decision No: BGM-2025 / Q. No.81 / Earth-2
Mantralaya, (Main Building) 4th Floor, Madame Cama Marg,
Martyr Rajguru Chowk, Mumbai - 400 032
Date: 19th November, 2025
Read: - Letter No. No. TM SSRI / UOR-18 / 2025-26 / 1402D of the Office of the Accountant General (Accounts & Licensure), Maharashtra-], Nagpur. 04.11.2025
The Proposal:
The Maharashtra Sadan building in Navi Delhi has been granted VIP status and offers in-house suites for the Hon'ble Governor of the State of Maharashtra, Hon'ble Chief Minister, Hon'ble Chief Justice, Hon'ble Ministers, Hon'ble MPs, Hon'ble MLAs and other dignitaries. Also, the venue hosts events for high-profile personalities such as the Hon'ble President, Hon'ble Vice President and Hon'ble Prime Minister. As a result, Maharashtra Sadan is a very important and prestigious building. This is because the building must be in good condition. The building is of the dormitory type and is not a permanent residence, so funds are allocated to this building under the accounting available for office buildings.
Considering the above facts, the conservation and repair works of Maharashtra Sadan buildings need to be taken up on priority. However, the Department has a larger liability in terms of budgetary provision for maintenance and repair of government non-residential buildings under the Urban Division. The ministry, as well as other important government offices, are located in Mumbai under this division. In the Ministry
Spacious offices have been made available to cabinet members. Maintenance and repair of these offices needs to be done on a priority basis. Therefore, the preservation and repair of the Maharashtra Sadan buildings requires the creation of a separate head of accounts on the lines of the Raj Bhavan buildings, so that these works can be done on priority.
The government's decision:
For the purpose of "Maintenance and Repair of Maharashtra Sadan, New Delhi (Mandatory)," the Government is approving the creation of a new title as follows.
Preservation and Repair of Maharashtra Sadan Building in New Delhi (Compulsory):
