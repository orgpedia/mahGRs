Introduction -
Entrepreneurs who have their own financial capacity under the hybrid annuity project implemented for overall road development of the state. They have been allowed to deposit 40 percent Equity in Escrow Account in phases. Accordingly, the above S.N. Permission has been given under No. 3, taking into consideration the suggestions received from the entrepreneurs and the difficulties presented by the Chief Engineer to the Government, dt. In a government decision issued on November 01, 2018, Hon. The Sub-Committee of the Board of Ministers dt. As per the approval given on January 08, 2019, the following partial changes are being made:
1) In the above government decision table no. 1 shows the Equity to be deposited by the entrepreneur as 8 percent. In this case, the cost of the work done by the entrepreneur is measured by the Executive Engineer in the case of works where the entrepreneur has started the actual work at the work site and has spent his own money on it as per the recommendation of the Chief Engineer.
It should be validated and fixed based on prevailing tariff. This cost should be considered as Entrepreneur&#39;s Equity. In such a place, after depositing Performance Bank Guarantee of 5 percent, and Bank Guarantee of Mobilization Advance of 1 percent, the condition of depositing 8 percent Equity in the Escrow Account by the entrepreneur is being relaxed. If the entrepreneur has actually started work on the site, he is allowed to deposit the first installment of Mobilization Advance (5 percent) in the Escrow Account by this Government Decision.
2) If the amount of Equity has been deposited in the Escrow Account, the entrepreneur should be given a monthly installment of Mobilization Advance after the cost of the work started equal to 10 percent (10 percent of the bid project cost). Also, the work started by the entrepreneur after giving permission to the entrepreneur to deposit the Equity amount in the Escrow Account
