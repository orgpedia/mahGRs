Read:- Public Works Department, Circular No: 1) MIS-2019/CR01/Plan-3, Dated-11.01.2019 2) MIS-2017/CR18/NH2, Dated-28.02.2017 3) RSC2018/ CR227(pt.1)NH2, Dated-09.01.2019 Introduction: Thousands of people lose their lives or are seriously injured in road accidents in India every year. The families of the accident victims have to suffer serious consequences.
Also, the country has to suffer social and economic losses due to accidents. Due to death or disability in an accident, it causes a great loss not only to their families, relatives but also to the entire society.
The Public Works Department has issued circulars regarding road safety works from time to time as given in the above context. It was under consideration to issue an all-inclusive guideline circular on proper execution of road safety functions. The implementation of these guidelines should be implemented by all engineers while working on road safety, preparing new project reports, planning works.
Hon&#39;ble Supreme Court in connection with road safety. Retired Supreme Court Justice J.S. A committee has been formed under the chairmanship of Radhakrishnan, and it is very necessary to seriously and strictly follow the guidelines given by the said committee for accident prevention. An average of 12,000 people die and an average of 20,000 to 22,000 people are seriously injured in road accidents every year in Maharashtra. Not all accidents that occur at black spots and places where accidents occur are due to wrong design and construction of the road. Although it is accepted that 95% of accidents are due to human error, our first duty is to take some special precautions and take measures to control the speed of vehicles. However, all the officers and employees are expected to take positive action regarding elimination of (Black Spot) first. Accordingly, the following government decision is being issued after a thorough study.

Govt Decision No: Aprakshe-2019/(P.No.32/19)/R.M.2
Circular: 1) Definition of Black Spot Accident Site: Union Ministry of Road Transport has given the following definition for declaring accident site as Black Spot on National Highway. According to (Ministry of Road Transport &amp; Highways, No.RW/NH/15017/109/2015/P &amp; M (RSCE) Dated 28.10.2015) Road accident Black Spot is a stretch of National Highway of about yoo m. in length in which either accidents (in all three years put together involving fatalities grievous injuries) took place during the last 3 calendar years or 90 fatalities (in all three years put together ) took place during the last 3 calendar years&quot; according to the above definition Maharashtra Police (Traffic Branch) periodically releases the list of blackspot accident sites based on the accident statistics of the last 3 years.
2) Preliminary survey of Blackspot accident site: A committee has been appointed at Government level and Regional level vide Government Circular No.Misc-2017/CR18/NH2, dated 28.02.2017. Accordingly, in accordance with the above definition, in the list of black spot accident sites declared through the traffic police system, the Chief Engineer should inspect the black spots declared in their respective regional divisions along with the respective Superintending Engineers, Executive Engineers, Deputy Engineers and Junior Engineers.
It should also include police officers as well as traffic police officers.
Through this inspection (Preliminary summery) the geometric structure of the road at the place of Black Spot such as curves, slopes; Site distance, width of bridges and road condition should be studied. In this, the cause of the accident should be discussed with the concerned traffic police / police.
(i) If it is found that after considering all the factors that lead to the accident found in the inspection, such Black Spot where the accidents are not due to the geometrical structure of the road or other engineering errors, the Chief Engineer should issue such a certificate and inform the Government.
However, Traffic calming measures that reduce the speed of vehicles to prevent future accidents at such blackspot accident sites. Precautions should be taken as described below: (ii) After initial inspection of the accident sites (Black Spot) as above and analysis of the causes of the accident, if engineering errors are found to be the cause of the accident according to the condition of the accident site (Site conditions), the engineering improvements to be made to prevent the accident should be listed there. These works should be classified as immediate measures and permanent long term measures.

Govt Decision No: Aprakshe-2019/(P.No.32/19)/R.M.2
The following methods should be adopted for short term measures and long term engineering improvements: 3) a) Traffic Calming Measures: Once the blackspot accident site is declared, the number of fatal accidents occurring there should be immediately controlled. The purpose of the immediate temporary improvements is to reduce the speed of vehicles at such black spot locations and to warn the drivers about the black spot. This should include the following: i. A 0.9X 1.20M facing board should be installed (both sides) in front of the accident site.
ii. A speed limit of 20 km/hr should be posted (both sides).
iii. Rumbler Strips (both sides) should be applied.
iv. Next is the Rumbler Strips facing board on both sides. If the length covered by the Black Spot is more than 50m Rumbler should be done at least 30m before the Black Spot on either side. So that the driver will get a warning and the speed of the vehicles will be reduced while going through the Black Spot.
V. Black Spot Road Marking (edge line, center line) ed uri Huild Zebra Crossing should be done if necessary.
vi. Cats eye, delineator should be used to alert the driver at night.
vii. If possible, Red Blinker (Signal Solar Battery) should be applied at the place of Black Spot.
viii. In urban areas, if necessary, precautionary measures like one-way traffic, prohibition of heavy vehicles should be implemented with the help of traffic police.
ix. If there are stripes on both sides of the road, they should be filled with mud and pressed.
X. Crash barrier or roller crash barrier should be provided as required.
B) Short term measures (Procedure for immediate measures): Estimate of immediate measures to be taken by the Chief Engineer with the help of the concerned Superintending Engineer, Executive Engineer or by appointing a road safety consultant if necessary at all Black Spot locations in their area of work IRC SP should be prepared as per the guidelines in -88.
If necessary, a road safety expert consultant should be appointed for this purpose. The Road Safety Advisor should be appointed on the following criteria.
1) Should be in the post of Civil Engineering and should have at least 7 years of experience in road construction and maintenance.
2) Road safety course or approved course of Road Safety Auditor of at least two weeks should have been completed.

or
Must have completed post graduate course in Traffic Management or Traffic Engineering with Road Safety and Traffic Safety.
3) Should have at least 2 years of experience in road traffic safety related works.
4) At least 3 road safety audits should be done.
If temporary/immediate measures are suggested to the Road Safety Consultant for each Black Spot, a total fee of Rs.2 lakhs for Safety Audit and Estimate (this should include all incidental expenses) should be done by the Chief Engineer through Non Plan Maintenance grant.
c) The Government is approving short term (7 days) tenders for the temporary/immediate repair work fixed as above to be completed within 3 months out of annual maintenance repair grant.
4) Long-term permanent measures: (a) According to the preliminary survey and inspection of the black spot, if some permanent long-term engineering improvements are required, the Chief Engineer will appoint a road safety expert to suggest the necessary engineering improvements and make a detailed estimate of them after carrying out his detailed survey and safety audit. can
For this, a fee of up to Rs.5 lakh should be paid to the road safety expert consultant for preparing detailed survey safety audit investigation and estimate and tender documents.
At the place (Black Spot) where it is necessary to take permanent long-term measures and it takes a long time to complete the work, therefore immediate measures should be taken as above at the place of Black Spot so that the vehicle drivers can get a complete idea of the accident site and help to reduce the speed of the vehicles and avoid accidents.
The criteria for appointing a Road Safety Consultant will remain the same as in 3(b) above if necessary for long-term permanent measures.
(b) Guidelines for long-term improvement :- The long-term engineering measures to be taken to improve the black spot should be as suggested by the Road Safety Consultant as per the survey and at the end of the study. The measures suggested by the consultant should be reviewed by the Chief Engineer.
Long-term engineering improvements should include the following instructional items:

Temporary as well as permanent improvement of Black Spot should be done from the funds received under Road Maintenance and Repair (3054) given to the Regional Department. It is mandatory to use 5% of the total funds received under Road Maintenance Repair for accident site improvement works. (Government Circular dated 27.2.2017)
Authority to approve accident site improvement works to be done only on Black Spot As per Government Circular dated 9.4.2019 Executive Engineer- Rs. 50 lakhs, Rs.1 crore at the level of Superintending Engineer and Rs.1 crore at the level of Chief Engineer. Empowered to issue Job Number up to 2 crores. This right should be exercised only on Black Spot (list of 1324 blackspots announced by Traffic Branch, Maharashtra Police).
Apart from the black spot in the declared list, the works to be done to reduce the accidents should be done according to the prevailing method of the regional department (CR works). When the chief engineer requests road maintenance repair to the government, the list of works submitted for that purpose should include the job number given for temporary &amp; permanent repair of black spot improvements on first priority.
After approval of the permanent and immediate measures to be taken for blackspot remediation, tenders should be called and contractors should be appointed. However, if the length of the black spot is included in the length of the ongoing work (On going work may be of any scheme like budgeted work, HAM work, CRF work, ADB work) and the permanent or immediate remedial works are not within the scope of Ongoing work. Such work should be proposed and completed as variation in that work. But care should be taken that these blackspot rectification works do not increase the completion time of the original work.

5) Black Spot Permanent Improvement Work Measures (Efficiency) Inspection Procedure: (A) Revised Protocol for Identification and Rectification of Black Spot: It is necessary to take action by keeping a Systematic Approach to reduce the accidents on the Black Spot and to control the accidents on the road. Government decision regarding this has been issued by Public Works Department on 09.01.2019. In this the committee has to do the following tasks: a) Identification of new black spots by keeping records of accidents.
b) Studying the Black Spot and from a scientific perspective, keeping an eye on the improvement work and doing it efficiently and effectively.
E) Is the Black Spot re-occurring in the future after repair work is completed? Monitor this.
For this, a committee should be formed under each police station and representatives of various systems related to the following roads and traffic should be appointed in it.
1) Inspector of Police / Deputy Inspector Chairman 2) Deputy Engineer / Junior Engineer, S.B. Department Member Secretary 3) Transport Officer / Transport Inspector (RTO) Member 4) Deputy Engineer / Junior Engineer Zilla Parishad Member
At each police station level, Public Works Department should verify the applicability of temporary and permanent engineering measures for the improvement of the blackspot site established by the Revised protocol for Identification, Rectification, if there is no road accident at the blackspot site for 3 consecutive years after the work is completed. For this, a record of the accident should be made available from the traffic police system and if there is no accident at the black spot due to the construction of the road or the condition of the road, the chief engineer should certify and inform the government about the elimination of the black spot.
In case of blackspot, Chief Engineer (National Highways), S.B. The rectification works should be carried out as per circular RW-NH-29011/01/2019-S&amp;R (P&amp;B), dated August 26, 2019 of the Union Ministry of Surface and report to the Government from time to time.
(c) While doing DPR in big projects like HAM, CRF, ADB, 4 lanning, widening and upgradation, we should give report to the government as if we have done security audit.

The Public Works Department, Government of Maharashtra has already informed that 9% of the amount will be kept for Road Safety Audit while giving administrative approval to big (above 5 km) projects by the Government decision dated 11.1.2019.
6) Directions given by the Hon&#39;ble Supreme Court Road Safety Committee (along with Black Spot Reforms) regarding other measures to be taken to reduce road accidents.
Temporary and permanent improvement works at Black Spot locations are to be done on first priority. Apart from that, orders have been given to plan the following measures to reduce the number of road accidents.
A) Village Gateway Provisions : Villages located on National Highway, State Highway have high chances of accidents in the length of the village. Therefore, if Traffic Calming Measures are given in such length, these accidents can be avoided. For this the following action should be taken.
1) State Highway and CE (NH) in your regional division should list which villages are on NH.
2) These works should be done phase wise by giving priority to the villages with large population and markets in this list. It should include the following tasks.
i) Board should be put up saying “Village is ahead drive slowly”.
ii) Speed Limit 30km/hr. Board should be installed on both sides.
iii) Centerline/edge marking should be done along the length of the village.
iv) Zebra crossing should be made for pedestrians to cross the road.
v) School Board should be placed near the school.
vi) Rumbler strips should be provided on both sides of the village so that vehicles can enter the length of the village by slowing down.
vii) Rumbler strips speed limit board should be installed where some internal roads meet in the length of the village.
viii) Yellow Blinkers should be installed to warn the drivers at night time.
A list of villages on SH and NH should be prepared and prioritized among them and these works should be undertaken in phase wise within a period of 3 years. These works should be done under maintenance repair account head 3054.
Traffic calming measures should be deliberately completed in the villages which are coming under HAM, CRF, Budgeted work, ADB Bank projects.

Govt Decision No: Aprakshe-2019/(P.No.32/19)/R.M.2
b) Accident safety at road junctions (Supreme Court Road Safety Committee Guidelines): Provide traffic calming measures to reduce the speed of vehicles to prevent accidents at other road junctions on NH and SH and upgrade the junctions to IRC standards in a phased manner.
In order to avoid large number of accidents at junctions where other roads meet, the following measures have been suggested: 1) Traffic calming measures.
i) “JUNCTION AHEAD DRIVE SLOW” Board on either side of the junction.
ii) Laying Rumbler strips on both sides at 75-50m from the junction.
iii) Boarding of Rumbler strips.
iv) Road Marking centerline, edge line, yellow band, Zebra crossing (at village junction) v) Speed limit 30km/hr. from both sides.
Rumbler strips, Board and Making on access roads on SH and NH.
vi) Provide Yellow solar blinker at night time at heavy traffic junctions if possible.
For this, first all the junctions on NH,SH and finally NPR should be listed and these works should be done step by step after deciding the priority.
HAM, CRF, ADB, Project Budget works are not included in ongoing works, from Maintenance fund (3054) should be completed step by step by Chief Engineer giving Job number.
In the upcoming big project works like HAM, CRF, ADB, Budget work, it will be mandatory to include road safety and black spot improvement works in the length of the project.
C) Conducting Safety Audit of accident prone stretches / ghat roads. (Guidelines of Road Safety Committee of Supreme Court)
The Supreme Court Road Safety Committee has suggested that the National Highway, State Highway, major district roads and other accident-prone roads in the state should be conducted safety audits and the number of accidents and deaths should be brought under control. Accordingly, the safety audit of the length of the ghat on NH and SH should be done first, the safety audit of the vulnerable length should be done by the chief engineer by appointing an independent accident safety consultant.
