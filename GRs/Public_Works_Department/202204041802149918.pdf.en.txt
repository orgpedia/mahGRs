Government of Maharashtra
Department of Public Works
Govt Decision No: Miscellaneous-2022/P.No.02/Plan-4
Madam Kama Marg, Martyrdom Rajguru Chowk,
Mantralaya, Mumbai-400 032.
Date :- 04th April, 2022.
Preface: While taking up the works of roads passing through the forest area in the state and the works of bridges on said roads as well as widening or other improvement works, it is necessary to take the approval of the Forest Department as necessary.
If there is no proper coordination between the Public Works Department and the Forest Department while taking decisions on such cases, the decision-making process is delayed. For the purpose of avoiding the said delay, the issue of forming committees of the officers of Forest Department and Public Works Department at the state level as well as at the divisional level was under the consideration of the government to maintain proper coordination between these two departments and thereby to dispose of such cases promptly.
Government Decision: The following committees are being formed at state level and divisional level to solve the issues related to forest department of roads and bridges under the jurisdiction of Public Works Department.
