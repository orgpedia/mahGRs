Introduction Proposals for approval of leave for more than 180 days of various offices under Public Works Department, Zilla Parishad as well as Officers/Employees (Technical/Non-Technical) on deputation are submitted to the Government for approval by the Regional Offices. While scrutinizing the said proposals, it has come to the notice of the Government that the officers/employees remain absent for long periods and submit leave application while joining the office. There is no mention of rules/provisions in the said leave approval proposal. Also, the proposals are sent to the government level in a very hasty and hasty manner without proper scrutiny. Since the said proposal is not perfect, frequent correspondence has to be done with the field offices. This leads to further delay in processing an already delayed proposal. Sometimes officers/employees retire but their leave cases remain pending. Alternatively, they may not get pension benefits on time. Considering all these aspects, it is under the consideration of the Government to submit instructions regarding the vigilance to be taken while submitting leave proposals of officers/employees (Technical/Non-Technical) at the Government level. Accordingly, following instructions are given.
Circular In the case of absence of officers/employees (Technical/Technical) in case of absence of officers/employees (Technical/Technical), Regional Offices should proceed as per the following instructions while sending the proposal to the Government level (1) Various offices under Public Works Department, Zilla Parishad as well as Officers/Employees on deputation (Technical/Technical) Before going on leave, the leave must be approved with the prior permission of the superiors.
