Introduction:
Department of Public Works. As per Government decision dated 15.06.2002, Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation was declared as the entrepreneur for construction and improvement of Nagpur Aurangabad-Sinnar-Ghoti-Mumbai road and allowed to collect road toll at 13 toll stations as per proposed toll rates to recover the cost of the project. The estimated cost of the said project was Rs.700 crores. Out of this, Rs.159.00 crore (Rs.150 crore subsidy and 9 crore land acquisition cost) was expected to be received from the government, but the said amount was not received on time, and due to obstacles in the land acquisition of the project, the project cost increased. Instead of the said 13 road tax stations, the road tax collection actually started at only 8 places, so the road tax collection also decreased and then as per the announcement of the government on 30.06.2014, the road tax collection on the project was stopped. All these factors have increased the cost of the project and as mentioned in the letter of Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation dated 31.03.2016, the revised amount of the project is Rs.807.00 crore. Also, the average interest rate to be paid by the corporation for the said project is 14% as on 31.03.2016 the amount is Rs.2621.80 crores. Therefore, the Corporation had requested to purchase the said project and pay a lump sum. According to the request made by the corporation, the matter of approving the revised amount of the project and the interest for the same to the corporation was under the consideration of the government. Accordingly, the matter has been approved in the meeting of the Cabinet Infrastructure Committee held on 23.08.2018. According to this, the government has now taken the following decision.
Government Decision: Due to the difficulties encountered in the construction and improvement of the Nagpur - Aurangabad - Sinnar-Ghoti - Mumbai road and also because the road toll collection was stopped on 30.06.2014 after the toll collection was started, the revised cost of the project comes to Rs.807 crores. In accordance with this, the said project is being approved by the government as follows:
