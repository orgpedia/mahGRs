Introduction:
India, one of the fastest growing economies in the world, is growing much faster than many Western countries. Despite its growing population, the country is working hard to transform itself in the coming decades. The city of Mumbai is an exception due to land division, transport and traffic related issues. Due to the ever-increasing vehicular traffic, it is imperative to create freeways to reduce congestion in the city of Mumbai.
Mumbai is one of the most populous cities and the capital city of Maharashtra, also known as the financial capital of India. 21.3 million population and about 21,000 people/sq. Due to the high population of K., there is a demand for proper transport system and it is important to have transport system in the life of people with average income. At present, a majority of Mumbai&#39;s population depends on bus and public rail services. Further, the existing roads and local transport have been facilitated with the opening of Metro Line, Mono Rail and Coastal Road.
As Mumbai is a coastal city consisting of various beaches, the city of Mumbai is developing. Land is an important resource for the overall development of the city and suburbs, and it is essential to utilize it significantly for the development of the city. A large number of people live in the northern suburbs and commute daily to the suburbs of the southern island for various tasks. Transport facilities between suburbs and main Mumbai are gaining importance. Passengers of western suburbs traveling from North Mumbai to South Mumbai area are currently traveling on S.V. Road and use the Western Expressway. As both of these are insufficient, traffic congestion increases and thus increases travel time. There is a need to extend alternative routes from the main suburbs like Bandra and Andheri to the north side suburbs like Virar.
Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation was ordered to check the feasibility of the Versova to Virar Sagari Setu project in order to solve the traffic congestion in Mumbai. Accordingly, the Government has taken the following decision in the meeting of the Cabinet Infrastructure Committee held on 25.08.2021.
