Introduction -
A large number of air conditioning systems are used in government offices under the Maharashtra government. It has been pointed out by the government that in many places its temperature is kept at 18 to 20 degrees Celsius. Due to this unnecessary consumption of electricity causes financial loss to the government and excessive use of energy generating sources disturbs the balance of the environment. In this regard, the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) of the Central Government has indicated that if the air conditioning system is used at a temperature of 24 degrees Celsius, 24% electricity can be saved and this temperature is best for the humidity and proper air circulation required by the human body. Due to this, people coming from outside do not have to face the extreme change in temperature. The said temperature will be beneficial to the environment and will complement the green building concept. Considering all these aspects, the following government decision is being issued and it should be strictly followed.
Government decision -
All air conditioners and systems in government offices and rest houses and other buildings should be kept at 24 degrees. (Or ensure that the temperature remains at 24 degrees.) In this way, proper use of the air conditioning system can help to maintain the balance of the environment by limiting the use of energy generating sources and will save the money of the alternative government.‚Äù
