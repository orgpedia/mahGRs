Read : 1) Government Decision, Public Works Department, No. Khakshes-2018/P.No.75/Road-9A, dated 25.01.2019 2) Government Decision, Public Works Department, No. Khakshes-2018/P.No. 75/Roads - 9A, dated 25.02.2019 Preface - Although sufficient technical expertise is available in the Public Works Department for conception, construction and special repairs of roads, bridges and buildings, sometimes due to insufficient manpower or sometimes complex technical issues, There is a need to hire consultants or experts for the needs of modern technology, environmental studies and similar matters, feasibility studies, research studies as well as legal and financial studies for projects to be privatized. Reason: The Government has published the Government Decision on appointment of Consultants dated 25.01.2019 and according to it, the right of appointment of Consultant Services has been provided from Chief Engineer to Public Works Department level.
At present most of the posts of Junior Engineer, Deputy Engineer under Public Works Department are vacant. Reason, insufficient manpower is available for supervision, coordination, planning, plotting, etc. at the field level. Reason, the Superintending Engineer/Executive Engineer needs various consultants for the said works. The proposal for appointment of consultants for minor works goes to the Chief Engineer for approval. In order to avoid wastage of time in the said process, for the appointment of consultants for small works, the matter of dividing the power of appointment of consultants given to the Chief Engineer and giving the said power to the Superintending Engineer was under the consideration of the Government. According to this the following government decision is being issued.
