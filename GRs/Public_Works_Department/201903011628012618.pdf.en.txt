Read:- Government Decision No. Miscellaneous 2018/P.No.74/Plan-1A, dated 6th June 2018 Preamble The Government has decided to construct a toilet center for all general passengers along the state highways and major district highways under the jurisdiction of the Public Works Department. Roadside sites have been selected in various districts for setting up these toilets and associated facility centers. Some private entrepreneurs, financial institutions, charitable organizations have shown readiness to build such toilet centers at their own expense. Pursuant to this, the issue of allowing central government Public Undertakings (PSUs), private companies, private individuals, banks, financial institutions, charitable organizations (NGOs) to set up public convenience centers along the roads in the state at their own expense and for daily maintenance was under the consideration of the government and accordingly the under-referenced .Government Decision dated June 06, 2018 was issued. Presently, some charitable organizations have proposed to set up “Public Works Department Jan Suvidha Kendra” (hereinafter referred to as “Jan Suvidha Kendra”) along the main highways, state highways as well as major district highways in the state. Preparedness has been shown in the meeting held with the Principal Secretary (S.B.). The proposed amenity center will include restrooms and commercial stalls/stores. These organizations have proposed to construct the said Jan Suvidha Kendra and clean, maintain and repair the Jan Suvidha Kendra initially for 10 years and then for the next 10 years according to their efficiency, thus up to a maximum of 30 years. Accordingly, since Annexure-A and Annexure-B of the agreement with the government decision dated 06.06.2018 under reference are in Marathi language, the other linguistic charitable organizations do not understand the terms and conditions therein. For this, the matter of translation of Annexure-A and Annexure-B attached to the Government Decision dated 06.06.2018 into English (Appendix-A) and amending the Government Decision under reference as necessary and including additional terms and conditions was under the consideration of the Government. Also taking into consideration the feedback of the Law and Justice Department, the Government is hereby incorporating the following amendments and additional terms and conditions in the Government Decision under reference. Also, the original Annexure-A and Annexure-B are being issued together with the English translation (Annexure-A).
