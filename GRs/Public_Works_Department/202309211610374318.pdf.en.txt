Introduction -
The construction and ancillary works of the buildings of most of the departments in the state are done by the Public Works Department. However, at times, changes are suggested to the field officers of the CBD through the consumer department while starting and progressing the work. The officers and employees of the approved plan are asked to work on more area than the permissible floor area and alternatively, the construction area of the building is increased, additional floors are mentioned, works of higher standard specifications than permissible specifications are mentioned, work of furniture is asked to be increased substantially, construction of internal roads and fencing, work to be done on more than the approved amount. Such a thing has happened.
This was discussed at the high-level committee meeting. All field officers have been given clear instructions not to make such changes as on 13.12.2022. However, since it was found that the instructions were not being implemented effectively, the matter of disseminating the revised guidelines was under the consideration of the government.
