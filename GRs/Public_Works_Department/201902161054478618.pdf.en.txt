Introduction : Nagpur-Mumbai Rapid Transit (Maharashtra Samriddhi Highway) project is an ambitious project of the state government. The government has declared the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation Limited as the &quot;Implementing Mechanism&quot; for the implementation of the scheme.
Nagpur-Mumbai Expressway (Maharashtra Prosperity Highway) passes through 10 districts namely Nagpur, Wardha, Amravati, Washim, Buldhana, Jalna, Aurangabad, Ahmednagar, Nashik and Thane.
Out of the land required for the said highway, a large amount of land has been acquired through direct purchase through private negotiations. Also, the rest of the land has been acquired under the Maharashtra Highways Act.
Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation has appointed contractors for the construction of the said project. Preliminary preparations have been made at the regional level for the construction of the highway through the said contractors and the actual construction is being started in the near future.
For the construction of the project, the contractor needs to obtain easily and timely the similar licenses from the concerned departments like minor mineral extraction licences, temporary non-agricultural licences, explosive licences, water use licences, temporary diesel storage licences, pollution control board licences, labor licences, etc. Accordingly, the issue of setting up a task force under the chairmanship of the Collector for the effective implementation of the Nagpur-Mumbai High Speed Expressway (Maharashtra Samriddhi Highway) project was under the consideration of the government.
Government Decision:
For the effective implementation of the Nagpur-Mumbai Expressway (Maharashtra Samriddhi Highway) project and for the necessary permits for the construction of the project to be issued in an easy and timely manner, a task force is being formed under the chairmanship of the Collector.
