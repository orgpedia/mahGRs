While preparing the said seniority list, after examining the records/ documents received from the Regional and Regional Offices under the Public Works Department and considering the objections received, it was observed that in the Government Decision dated 31.01.1989, while creating the category of Civil Engineering Assistant, the employees who did not have the necessary departmental training for inclusion in the post of Civil Engineering Assistant from the lower cadre have been included in the post of Civil Engineering Assistant. Apart from the technical and supervisory posts from the subordinate offices, it is also seen that the employees of labor or other non-technical posts have also been included in the post of Civil Engineering Assistant.
