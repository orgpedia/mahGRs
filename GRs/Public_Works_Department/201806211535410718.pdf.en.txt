The Central Government has made it mandatory and mandatory to use waste plastic in the top layer of asphalting (hot mix asphalting) under its reference circular dated November 9, 2015. Hon.

Hon&#39;ble Chief Secretary has instructed to take action as per the instructions given by the Prime Minister.
