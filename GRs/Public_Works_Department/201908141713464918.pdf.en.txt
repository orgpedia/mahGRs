The zonal officers of the Public Works Department have to take up and complete the work in emergency situations such as overflowing of the bridge, the works to be started and completed immediately to smooth the traffic in the flood situation, the works that arise suddenly for the visit of very important persons. As the authority to issue job numbers for the works is at the zonal level, the Superintending Engineer should expedite the process of issuing the necessary job numbers for these works.
According to Government Decision No. CAT/2017/Pro.No.08/Ema-2 dated 27/09/2018 of Public Works Department, it is mandatory to take further action by inviting tenders through public notices for works costing Rs.3 lakhs as per E6 tender method. . It has come to the attention of the government that difficulties are arising at the regional level while following the above mentioned procedures. In August 2019, the authorities at the zonal level have brought to the notice of the government that due to the limited authority at the zonal level to take up the works quickly when the bridge fill was washed away and the roads/buildings were damaged. Hence in Appendix 42 of Maharashtra Public Works Rules Manual 1984 No. There is a need to amend 19.
In the current financial year 2019-20, damage to roads and bridges has been noticed due to unlimited heavy rains especially in Kolhapur and Sangli districts. The possibility of government buildings also being damaged cannot be ruled out. Damage to roads, bridges and buildings needs to be repaired immediately to restore normal life. Hence the following revised powers are being provided to the Zonal Officers.
