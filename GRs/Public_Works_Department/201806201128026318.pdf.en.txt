In the state of Maharashtra, some roads under the purview of various agencies such as Public Works Department, Village Development Department, Municipal Corporation and Municipal Corporation have old arched bridges. Most of these old bridges are of stone construction and some of them are of concrete construction. An old stone arch bridge over the river Savitri on the Mumbai-Goa highway was damaged in the monsoon floods of 2016, causing huge loss of life and property. A one-member commission of a retired judge, High Court, investigated the accident in which the bridge on the river Savitri was swept away. In the said inquiry report Hon. The Commission of Inquiry has suggested some measures to avoid accidents like the Savitri river bridge in case of such arch bridges. Bringing the said measure to the notice of all concerned departments was under the consideration of the Government. Accordingly the following instructions are being given.
Circular:
Following are the measures to be taken to take care of the old arch bridges on the roads under the jurisdiction of the state area and local self-government bodies in the state in line with the bridge accident on Savitri river.
1. It is necessary to keep a record of the maximum flood level after every monsoon and to keep it in the register along with the year of the maximum flood level on the piers/ends of the bridges. Also, if there is an increase in the maximum flood level, the records should be updated by informing the local administration.
2. Vegetation/trees growing on bridge construction should be uprooted. If the roots of such plants/trees are likely to damage the construction, chemicals or other alternatives should be used so that they do not grow back after being cut from the roots.
3. Old bridges should be provided with lighting as far as possible to enhance night visibility.
At least solar powered blinkers on both sides and reflective cat eyes/road studs should be installed on both sides of the road on the bridge and also on the center line of double decker bridges.
4. Retroreflective notice boards of the form “Ek padari / narrow bridge”, “speed limit” – “submerged bridge” should be permanently installed at the junctions of bridges as per requirement and the relevant National Highways / Public Works Department / Rural Development Department / Local Authority / Police Department It should be ensured before monsoon that the notice board is in good condition.
5. In order to keep the speed limit of the vehicles on the bridges, old and narrow bridges should be fitted with rumbler strips as standard and warning boards should be installed and regular monitoring should be done.

6. During the monsoon season, after reviewing the entire situation, the duration of rain, the increasing level of flood, appropriate decision to stop the traffic on the bridge should be taken jointly by the competent officials of the revenue department of the concerned area, the concerned department maintaining the bridge and the police. Also, the bridge area should be patrolled by the concerned authorities along with the police.
7. As per Indian Roads Congress (IRC) guidelines, such bridges should be specially inspected every three to five years. Such special inspection should be done by the Executive Engineer and Superintending Engineer of the concerned authority in the presence of the Chief Engineer and the inspection list should be jointly recorded and signed.
8. Article-2 of the Indian Railways Bridge Manual, paragraph no. 208 P.No. 18 to 22 issued guidelines on maintenance and repair of arches. Appropriate action should be taken regarding the defects found in the arches and repairs as per the above provisions in the Railway Bridge Rulebook.
9. Masonry end of bridges / Pointing between foundations of columns should be redone and if eaves / stones are loose then jacketing of RCC around columns should be done.
10. If there is less thickness of cushioning on arch bridges, there is a possibility that it may be washed away and become a flood risk to the arches. However, on bridges with less cushioning, RCC can be properly anchored. A wearing course should be inserted.
11. If there is a cavity in the masonry of the footing / pillar of the arch bridge, the said cavity should be closed by cement mortar grouting and pantying.
12. In cases where bridge pillars need to be repaired, whether the repairs are properly done or how, the matter should be verified by an officer of the rank of Executive Engineer.
Also, the certificate signed by the officers verifying the repairs should be kept in the record and accordingly the name, designation and date of verification of the officer should be recorded in the necessary register.
13. If a new bridge is to be constructed by keeping the existing stone arched bridge as it is, the structure of the new bridge, height (General Arrangement Drawing) and distance / space (Gap) from the old bridge should be determined by Sankalp Chitra Mandal.
