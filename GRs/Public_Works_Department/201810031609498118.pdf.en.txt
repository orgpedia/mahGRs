Preface : Survey No. of Chembur, Mumbai. Development of 469-A government plot (Bhikshkari Griha Chembur) through privatization has been approved by the Ministerial Infrastructure Committee. Administrative approval was given in the meeting on August 8, 2007. Commencement order of this work was given on 27.06.2008. The original project had a deadline of 26.12.2011. The first extension was granted till 26.12.2014 and the second extension was till 26.12.2017.
Due to encroachments on the southern part of the land in this project, encroachments on the site of beggar house, revision of the development plan, encroachments of retired government employees, court cases, permission for felling of trees, etc., the developer could not make the entire plot available for work.
