According to the approval given, by the government decision dated 04.01.2017, Hindu Heart Emperor Balasaheb Thackeray has given revised approval for obtaining land through land pulling scheme for construction of Maharashtra Samriddhi Highway and related work and providing compensation in the form of developed land and related matters.
The said highway is being constructed based on latest technology. Therefore, highway amenities such as petrol/diesel pumps, CNG gas stations, electric vehicle charging stations, as well as future modern energy sources, vehicle repair facilities, restaurants/food malls, parking lots, bus ports, etc. Necessary facilities like truck terminals, hotels, motels, accessible toilets, trauma care centers / first aid facilities, emergency rescue centers, control rooms, management and maintenance centers, fire stations, ATMs, shops etc. must be constructed. Suitable and economical locations are being identified on both the routes of the expressway for the said highway facilities. A huge financial burden is coming on the corporation to acquire private land through direct purchase or acquisition for the said highway facilities and due to this the total cost of the project will also increase significantly. Taking these factors into consideration, acquisition of private land on a private partnership basis for highway facilities can save the cost of land acquisition and keep the cost of the project under control. However, there is no provision in the Government Decision dated 05.07.2016 and 04.01.2017 regarding acquisition of land on partnership basis under Land Pulling Scheme for highway facilities. Therefore, the creation of Wayside Amenities Centers on the Hindu Heart Emperor Balasaheb Thackeray Samrudhi Highway under the Land Pulling Scheme was under the consideration of the government.
