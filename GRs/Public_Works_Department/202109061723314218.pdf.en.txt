Introduction: Due to the industrial progress around Pune city, the existing road network for Pune city is now becoming inadequate. Heavy vehicle traffic from Mumbai to Kolhapur, Solapur and Ahmednagar, from Kolhapur to Nashik, Ahmednagar and Solapur and from Nashik to Solapur is passing through Pune city, causing internal traffic problems and adding to traffic congestion and pollution. As a solution to this, the government has decided to build a ring road around the city of Pune. Approved on 14 July 2015.
Pune city is growing rapidly in urbanization. Pune city has taken the lead in the country in the field of education, IT and auto industry. Three important national highways intersect through Pune city, Mumbai-Bangalore, Mumbai-Hyderabad-Vijayawada, Pune-Nashik and new national highways Pune-Pandharpur, Pune-Aurangabad, Pune-Mangaon. All types of inter-state traffic as well as intra-state traffic pass through the interior of the city as there is no ring road. Due to the lack of major wide roads within the city and narrow internal roads, this increased traffic volume is beyond the carrying capacity. Due to the dense population of the city as well as the specific geographical structure, there are limitations to widening the existing roads.
Due to mixed traffic in the city, air and noise pollution has increased beyond the limit. The problems of traffic accidents and vehicle parking are being faced. For this, it is necessary to take all types of traffic coming to Pune city from outside the city through ring road.
Accordingly, the Government has taken the following decision in the meeting of the Cabinet Infrastructure Committee held on 25.08.2021.
Government Decision:
1) Pune West Ring Road Urse (YCEW) to Varve (Bu.) Satara Road totaling 68.800 km. Approval is being given to the easement report of the length of the road.
