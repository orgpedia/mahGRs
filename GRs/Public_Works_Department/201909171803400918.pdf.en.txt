Despite this, complaints of irregularity and lack of transparency in the tender scrutiny are being received frequently and in some cases disciplinary action has to be taken after fixing the charges with the approval of the government. In some cases, court decisions have gone against the government and in some cases, time is being wasted by calling for new tenders. After thorough study of all these matters and all the cases received, the Government is once again issuing the following orders to all the Executive / Superintendent / Chief Engineers. All concerned should note that disciplinary action will be taken if the orders are not followed.
1) If there is any doubt in the information in the technical envelope or in the attached statement, the same should be clarified from the concerned contractor, in such case supplementary statements / certificates as well as additional information should be obtained and kept on record and the contractor should not be disqualified on the ground that the information in the technical envelope is insufficient. If the information in the technical envelope is incomplete, it should be given an opportunity to make it available within a specified period (8 / 15 days) as above and if the contractor is unable to do so, then disqualify him and inform him in writing and then proceed to open another tender. While scrutinizing the information contained in the technical envelope of the tender, it should be observed that the essential conditions of the core of the tender are being followed. True spirit of competition to get competitive rates should be the central idea of scrutiny to get competitive rates.
2) After the verification of the technical envelope, if the eligible contractor informs that “my financial account should not be opened” or “I am withdrawing from the competition”, it should be clearly rejected and his financial account should be opened.
