Introduction- Construction and ancillary works of most of the administrative department buildings in the state are done by the Public Works Department. Even after getting administrative approval, the construction work has not started due to non-availability of land. The government order in this regard was issued. It is clear that despite the instructions issued on 03.12.2019, they are not being followed.
It has been observed that after a considerable period of time has elapsed for the availability of space, the works are not being done within the approved budgetary amount, leading to cancellation of works or obtaining revised administrative approval. A certificate that space is available is issued when the budget is submitted for administrative approval. However, it is observed that the verification of the place is not actually taking place. The government was considering issuing revised guidelines in this regard.
Government Decision- 1. While presenting the Administrative Sanction Budget, revised guidelines for land availability are being circulated as follows: 1.1 If the Public Works Department has its own works, 7/12 regarding the availability of space and the Property Card should be checked by the Executive Engineer, S.B. If the required space is available on paper, the executive engineer should go to the space himself (no one should be granted rights) and take a photograph with geo tagging. At least 4-5 photographs of different directions should be taken in such a way that the executive engineer himself is visible along with the space in the photo. Photographs taken should also be attested and attached with the budget. The executive engineer should mention his name and designation while making the appointment.
1.2 The Superintending Engineer and the Chief Engineer should confirm and sign on 7/12, Photograph and Property Card while processing the budget received from them.
1.3 While submitting the administrative approval budgets of other administrative departments to the department, the Executive Engineer should ensure the minimum space required from 7/12, Property Card and if space is available, the site should be inspected. While inspecting the site, it shall be ensured that the Executive Engineer himself or his nominee in writing, the Deputy Engineer concerned for the work and at least one district level officer of the Consumer Affairs Department and exceptionally at least one Class-I level officer nominated by him in writing are present. Along with all this, at least 4-5 photographs should be geo-tagged in different directions and all the attendees should attest to it with name, designation and attach it to the budget.

1.4 On receipt of the Letter of Intent, the Executive Engineer, the Superintending Engineer and the Chief Engineer shall confirm and counter-sign on 7/12, Photograph and Property Card. If the district level officers of the consumer department are not present during the visit, they should also be taken along with the counter signature, name and designation. Except for the above, the officials of the Public Works Department shall not send the budget to the competent authority for approval.
1.5 P. Unless there is a certificate from the consumer department that the required space is available for the construction of the proposed building, the proposal can be sent to the Ministry through the Public Works Department. It should be noted that the report will not be submitted to the high-level committee of secretaries headed by the chief secretary.
2) Follow the instructions carefully.
3. It may be noted that in the subsequent period, if the proposals for administrative approval are found to have been received by the Government in violation of the above instructions, action will be taken against all concerned.
