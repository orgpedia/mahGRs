Government Decision No: Khakshes-2020/P.No.186/Raste-8,
The construction of the highway was expected to be completed by 2019 when the government had instructed the said corporations on 12.04.2017 to make the said funds available as loans. Had that been the case, the road tax revenue would have started in 2020 and repayments would have started. However, due to the time taken for land acquisition and obtaining permits under the Forest Protection Act, the toll revenue from the use of this highway is being delayed. Also now due to the global health pandemic of Kovid-19 there will be delay in project completion. Considering all these aspects, it is not possible for the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation to provide interest and repayment on the said secondary loan. If the repayment is not done within the stipulated period, the credit rating of the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation will be affected and it will be difficult to raise further funds.
The Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation is currently entrusted with various ambitious projects worth approximately 6.77,000 crores through the Government of Maharashtra. Among them are the current Hindu Hridaysamrat Balasaheb Thackeray, Maharashtra Samrudhi Highway, Versova-Bandra Project, Mumbai-Pune Missing Link Project, Thane Creek Bridge-|| And Bhiwandi Kalyan Shil Phata etc. Ambitious projects are underway. The funds required for this purpose are expected to be in the form of loan and share capital. Accordingly, the government has decided as follows to convert the secondary loan taken through various institutions for the land acquisition of Hindu Hridaysamrat Balasaheb Thackeray into preference shares of Nagpur-Mumbai Super Communication Expressway Limited Company.
Government Decision: Hindu Heart Emperor Balasaheb Thackeray to Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation for availability of funds required for land acquisition of Maharashtra Samrudhi Highway in secondary form 1) Mumbai Metropolitan Development Authority - Rs.1,000.00 crore, 2. Slum Redevelopment Authority â€“ Rs. 1,000.00 crore, 3) CIDCO - Rs. 1,000.00 crore, 4) MHADA - Rs. 1,000.00 crore, 5) MIDC. 1,500.00 crores and the interest thereon is being converted into Preference shares subject to the following conditions.
