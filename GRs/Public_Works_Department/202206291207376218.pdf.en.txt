As a result the total length of major district road grade roads in Ratnagiri district in the Road Development Plan 2001-2021 is 10,800 km. By increasing the total length (1975.775 + 10.800) i.e. 1986.575 km. So much so that the total length of rural roads is 10,800 km. By reducing the total length (6563.900-10.800) i.e. 6553.100 km. That will be it.
