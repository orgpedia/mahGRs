Introduction:
It is the responsibility of the Government of Maharashtra to improve the quality of life of the people by providing primary health care to the people of the state. For strengthening the public health system, it is necessary to create and preserve the medical infrastructure. In order to maintain the quality of existing government medical colleges and residences in the state, Ma. The Deputy Chief Minister has suggested to submit a proposal to provide funds through the Public Works Department for the maintenance and repair of these buildings.
In view of the above, the life of the Government Medical College/ Hospital buildings will be extended if funds are made available for the repair and maintenance of the buildings. Buildings should be kept clean and tidy.
Therefore, it is not necessary to make frequent repairs on these buildings. The Government was considering the creation of a new head of account to fund the budget for this purpose.
Government Decision:
The Government is approving the creation of two separate new heads of accounts for the purpose of" Preservation and Repair of Residential Buildings in Government Medical Colleges (Mandatory)" and" Preservation and Repair of Government Medical Colleges (Mandatory)" as follows:
