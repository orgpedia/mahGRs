Introduction: Hindu Hriday Samrat Balasaheb Thackeray Maharashtra Samruddhi Highway, the state's ambitious project to connect the state capital Mumbai and the deputy capital Nagpur, has been completed and opened for traffic. The rest of the route will be opened soon. In order to connect the eastern and western borders of the state of Maharashtra through the Shigrachar Expressway, Hindu Hriday Samrat Balasaheb Thackeray Maharashtra Samruddhi Highway is planned to be extended from Nagpur to Gondia.
The development of Nagpur-Gondia Access Controlled Rapid Transit Expressway is one of the major development projects in Eastern Maharashtra and its main objectives are as follows: i. Connecting Nagpur city with Gondia in the back and Mumbai in the front through access controlled expressway.
(ii) To connect the eastern and western borders of the State by an expressway.
(iii) Inter-State connectivity through expressways with the States of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Orissa and West Bengal etc.
Inter-state passenger and freight traffic will help in improving the viability of the Hindu Hriday Samrat Balasaheb Thackeray Maharashtra Samruddhi Highway.
v Socio-economic development of less developed districts of Eastern Maharashtra.
vi. Infrastructure will be leveraged for development of tribal areas.
Therefore, it is proposed to develop an access controlled Shigir Sanchar Expressway between Gondia and Gadchiroli ahead of Hindu Hriday Samrat Balasaheb Thackeray Maharashtra Samruddhi Highway, Nagpur.
The Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) has taken up the work of preparation of Detailed Project Report of Access Controlled Shigir Sanchar Expressway under Nagpur to Gondia (Package 1), Bhandara to Gadchiroli (Package 2) and Nagpur to Chandrapur (Package 3) for the overall development of the under-developed areas rich in natural mineral resources of Bhandara, Gondia, Gadchiroli and Chandrapur in the eastern region of Maharashtra. This will connect the underdeveloped and tribal areas of the eastern part of the state with the mainstream and will help in the social and economic development of the area, boost new industries and create a large number of jobs.
