In case of expenditure less / more than the approved / disbursed financial provision, the reasons have to be submitted to the Accountant General and the Public Accounts Committee. Many a times expenditure appears to be under/over due to incorrect expenditure records despite the expenditure being equal to the sanctioned provision. It is necessary to take timely action regarding such wrong records but due to not taking such action on time, difficulties arise in explaining to the Hon&#39;ble Principal Secretary and other senior officers during the testimony before the Public Accounts Committee. As a result, disciplinary action has to be taken against the concerned field officers.
2. Accountant General (Accounts &amp; Appropriations)-2 Nagpur has shown expenditure over/under sanctioned by concerned system in Appropriation Account 2018-2019. A pdf copy of the statement sent to the department by the Accountant General&#39;s office is being sent to all the Superintending Engineers by email along with this circular and its verification needs to be done urgently. One of the reasons for the under-expenditure data shown in the present statement is the wrong entries noticed during the expenditure reconciliation, mostly under the account headings, and proposals for correction in this regard must be submitted to the Accountant General&#39;s office from the concerned office immediately. As per Finance Department Circular No.RCN-1094/P.No.45/94/Audit dated 22.04.1994, after the Accountant General has sent the appropriation accounts to the Government, it is necessary to submit the proposal of incorrect entry to the Accountant General&#39;s Office before March 30, 2020 through the Government. To meet this deadline, proposals for correction of incorrect entries pending for the year 2018-2019 should be submitted by February 29, 2020. So that it will be possible for the government to verify the correction proposals of the said wrong entries and send them to the Accountant General within the prescribed time frame.
3. While submitting such proposals to the government, the concerned authorities / systems should keep the following points in mind.
1. Each separate rectification proposal of wrong entry should be submitted to the Government within the above deadline i.e. before 29th February, 2020. Superintending Engineer, Executive Engineer and Divisional Accountant should personally pay special attention to this.

(Eg demand number, under plan/non-plan, weight, data, computer code, tribal/non-tribal etc. should be mentioned.
5. If the proposal for correction of wrong entry is related to more than one department, the matter should be pointed out to the concerned department at the same time and the agreement of that department should be sought and a copy should be endorsed to the concerned Head of Administrative Department (Ministry) and Accountant General&#39;s office.
6. If grants have been sanctioned by other departments for works other than the scheme of the Public Works Department, the proposal for correction of wrong entry under that account head should be sent through the concerned administrative department to the mutual Accountant General and a copy of the same should be submitted to the Public Works Department. The responsibility of following up on the said proposal to the concerned department will be the responsibility of the concerned zonal/controlling officer (executive engineer/superintendent engineer).
7. After recommending the correction proposal to the Accountant General&#39;s Office from the Government, until the proposal is approved by the Accountant General, the Regional and Controller Officer should follow up with the Accountant General on behalf of the Government. The Divisional Accounts Officer will be responsible in this matter.
8. The concerned Executive Engineer and the Superintending Engineer as Controlling Officer shall be responsible for sending the proposal for correction of incorrect records related to Public Works Department to the Government in any case before 29th February, 2020.

9. The Divisional Officer and the Comptroller Officer should ensure that the department records the expenditure under the same account head under which the grant is sanctioned and the Accountant General also records the expenditure under the same account head. If discrepancies are found, proposals for correction of incorrect entries should be submitted.
4. All Chief Engineers/Superintending Engineers/Executive Engineers are hereby instructed that if any errors are noticed at the time of annual review from the Government level, the concerned Superintending Engineers/Executive Engineers/Divisional Accountants/Finance Clerks shall be held accountable for the inefficiencies shown in the cost mela work. And due to apathy, a departmental inquiry will be proposed from the government level. In this regard, even if it is pointed out by the Accountant General&#39;s office that the expenditure has been erroneously/inadvertently shown under another head of account, the concerned office shall bring the matter to the notice of the Accountant General&#39;s office within a reasonable period by way of a proposal for correction of the wrong entry.

The concerned Superintending Engineer will be responsible for bringing and making the necessary repairs within the prescribed time frame.
The respective Chief Engineers should ensure that the proposals for correction of wrong notes in their respective regional divisions are sent to the Accountant General within the prescribed time frame every year without delay.
5. Due to the non-sending of the proposal for correction of incorrect entries regarding expenditure on the appropriation account to the office of the Accountant General on time, it is often difficult for the Secretary of the Department as the head of the administrative department to analyze / explain during the testimony before the Legislative Committee due to the indifference shown by the Executive Engineer / Superintending Engineer regarding the proposal for correction of incorrect entries. In all cases where proposals for incorrect entry are not sent to the Accountant General&#39;s office within the prescribed time limit, it will be the responsibility of the concerned Chief Engineer to fix/propose responsibility under the Maharashtra Civil Service Conduct Rules, 1979 on the concerned Superintending Engineer / Executive Engineer / Divisional Accountant / concerned Finance Clerk.
