Introduction: The state has a network of about 3 lakh km of national highways, major state highways, state highways, major district roads, other district roads and rural roads. Of these, about 1,12,000 km of roads and bridges are maintained by the Public Works Department under repair and renovation schemes and with non-plan funds. Works on state highways and major district roads are budgeted by the Public Works Department. Under various schemes for road development works e.g. Funding is provided through various schemes like State Highways, Major District Roads, Hybrid Annuity Scheme, NABARD, Central Road Fund, etc. Roads, bridges and other ancillary works have been extensively budgeted through various schemes of the department.
The works have already been sanctioned to the extent / cost more than what the department is supposed to receive every year. Therefore, it is impossible for the department to pay the dues for these works out of the fixed amount it receives every year. If the sanctioned works do not receive funds on time, the cost of the works is going up drastically and the quality of the works is being adversely affected to a great extent.
5. D. On 13.01.2025 Ma. The Chief Minister was presented with an action plan for the Yoo days of the S.B.D. Department. In these meetings, it has been directed that while budgeting the works, S.B.V. should study the urgency, requirements, criteria of the works and include the works in the budget. This action should be taken when the works are included in the next budget. "
The Public Works Department is required to have a diversified policy on the number of new works to be sanctioned and limit the number of new works to be sanctioned. Accordingly, it was under the consideration of the Government to issue detailed guidelines on the works to be sanctioned afresh.
Government Circular: -
The Public Works Department is required to have a diversified policy on the number of new works to be sanctioned and limit the number of new works to be sanctioned. The following guidelines are being formulated regarding the precautions to be taken while budgeting new roads, bridges, and other ancillary works under affordable sub-sectors: -
1. Subject to the priority of the road development plan, works on roads with high traffic density and requiring urgent improvement, which are very important for the communication of state highways and major district roads, should be proposed.

The concerned Executive Engineer / Superintending Engineer / Chief Engineer shall prepare a Detailed Project Report (DPR) in accordance with the project requirement, priority, availability of funds, availability of land, No Objection Certificate from the Forest Department in case of requirement, etc., and submit the proposal to the Government through technical verification.
3. While proposing works on State Highways and Major District Roads, adequate care should be taken to ensure that there is no duplication of work and the certificate of Executive Engineer and Superintending Engineer thereof should be submitted. It should be strictly ensured that the work is not proposed to be done in different parts / pieces of work of consecutive lengths on the same road.
4. Under no circumstances shall works proposed or sanctioned in any other scheme be covered under this scheme and a certificate to the effect that the proposed work is not included in any other scheme as proposed or in the Default Period (DLP) shall be obtained from the Executive Engineer concerned. Also, works that have not yet been approved for expiry of their tenure should not be proposed.
5. While proposing to the Government to include in the budget proposals for road and bridge works on state highways and major district roads which are urgently required to be taken up for road development, the Executive Engineer shall submit to the Superintendent Engineer a priority list of new works which are required to be included in the budget in line with the improvement of damaged as well as very important high-speed roads subject to the ongoing road development plan and accordingly the Superintendent Engineer shall submit to the Government a district-wise consolidated proposal for road and bridge works under his Board.
6. Roads damaged due to damage, abandoned length, bridges / beams required for road continuity and improvement of roads in extremely damaged length shall be proposed subject to the approved road development plan, considering the high traffic density roads on the most important state highways and major district roads under the Public Works Department. Accordingly, the concerned Superintending Engineer shall personally inspect the works and submit a proposal accordingly to the Government. Works which are proposed for improvement / strengthening / asphaltisation at the field level should not be proposed outright.
7. Many times, the name of the work does not mention the road quality and number while proposing the works. Therefore, the name of the work should prominently mention the quality and number of the road while proposing the work, otherwise the work will not be included.
8. While proposing new construction of road bridges, the proposal for road and bridge works in the district should be submitted under Vava, which is available in non-tribal areas in the district.
9. They should be as complete as possible when submitting proposals for work. In particular, bridge works are sanctioned, but the sanctioned bridges are not joined or included in the bridge works. The construction of the sanctioned bridge is completed, but due to lack of a link road, the bridge remains unused. As a result, the government's capital expenditure becomes ineffective. Also, a large number of bridge works are sanctioned. However, once the works are approved, it takes time to design the works and after the approval, the project is approved, followed by tendering, commissioning, etc. Therefore, the actual work

The start-up is delayed and the estimated cost of the work increases. Therefore, proposals should be submitted only after inspecting the actual site while proposing the works.
10. There is a variation between the serial number given for many tasks and the serial number of the actual place where the work is to be done. Therefore, the field office should take care that proposals are received for change of serial number later as per the proposal and that there is no difference between the Marathi name and the English name of the proposed work, but such technical errors do not occur.
11. Proposals for revised administrative approvals are then submitted, deliberately showing lower cost of works, with a view to maximizing the budget. In order to prevent such undesirable practices, the Superintending Engineer shall personally inspect and submit the works to the Government.
12. While proposing works, only the most important works should be proposed for budgeting on priority, taking into account the remaining cost of the works taken up at present and the availability of new works, so as not to flood the remaining cost to a large extent.
13. Instead of proposing a continuous length of the same road, various parts / pieces of it result in wastage of government funds and time in budgeting these works separately, granting administrative approvals, tendering process etc. For example, if the works are budgeted in different parts of the same road length despite having the same subdivision and constituency, then such works should be tendered together rather than separately.
In cases where the work requires land acquisition / forest land acquisition, land acquisition / forest land acquisition should be proposed first without taking up cheap construction works.
