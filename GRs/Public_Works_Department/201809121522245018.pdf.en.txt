The government has issued a decision to increase the concession given to educated unemployed civil engineers vide government decision dated 31/05/2018. Accordingly, educated unemployed Civil Engineers are now registered as Class-4 i.e. for works up to Rs.150 lakhs. The latest technology of the highly educated engineers of the state has been utilized in government works. The government has taken this decision in order to make the works in the department better and better. Similarly, a demand has been made through various related organizations to increase the concession given to educated unemployed engineers (electrical). Since there has been no increase in the concessions given to the educated unemployed engineers (Electrical) during the last 10 years, the government is taking a decision to increase the concessions given to the educated unemployed engineers (Electrical) in view of the increase in the market price and the increasing competition.
Also, since there is a difference in the registration fee of the same category of construction and electrical contractors issued by the government decision on 27/2/2009, the registration fee of the electrical contractor is also being revised.
Government Decision:
1.1 Electrical Unemployed Engineers should be first registered up to Class-B (ie Rs.25 lakhs) instead of Class B-1 (ie Rs.15 lakhs). The term of this registration will be 10 years.
1.2 Also the electrical unemployed engineers were being given works worth Rs.30 lakhs in their quota. The said limit is now being increased to Rs.50 lakhs. Also, the maximum limit of the work given to them is being increased from Rs.7.50 lakhs to Rs.10 lakhs. The said concession will be available to those unemployed Electrical Engineers who have successfully completed work worth Rs.7.50 lakhs.
1.3 For this, unemployed electrical engineers should be given non-competitive works up to Rs.3 lakhs within their quota and Rs. E-tendering process should be implemented for works worth 3 lakhs.

1.5 Electrical qualified unemployed engineers are required to submit “Bond” in the attached form while participating in each e-tendering process.
1.6 Engineers whose original registration was in Electrical Educated Unemployed Engineer category and subsequently registered as Scheduled Contractors in class below Class B-1 as per their qualification, all such Educated Unemployed Engineers should be registered as Class-B up to Rs.25 lakhs.
