Government Decision No: Sink-2024 / P.No.83 / Earth-2
Mantralaya, (Main Building) 4th Floor, Madame Cama Marg,

Date: May 16, 2025
Read: - Office of the Accountant General (Accounts & Accounts), Maharashtra -], Nagpur Letter No: No. TM / GR]] / UOR - 32/2024-25 06 Dated 04.04.2025
The Proposal: -
Funds are budgeted by the Public Works Department for the maintenance and repair of all government residential and office buildings in the state. This budgeted fund disburses funds for payment of electricity bills, water lines, cleaning bills, etc., in addition to payment of pending bills for maintenance and repair of government residential and office buildings. It has come to the notice of the government that there is a huge backlog of pending payments under maintenance and repair of government residential and office buildings, resulting in insufficient funds to pay the pending dues of Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
For this reason, the state government needs to make special provisions for regular payment of non-refundable bills on residential and non-residential buildings. The government was considering creating a new ledger to budget funds for this purpose.
The government's decision:
1. The Government is approving the creation of two separate new heads of accounts for the purpose of "Payment of arrears on Government Residential and Non-Residential Buildings in the State."
