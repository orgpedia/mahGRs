As a result, the total length of major district roads in Kolhapur district in the Road Development Plan 2001-2021 is 70.00 km. By increasing the total length (1647.90 + 70.00) i.e. 1717.900 km. Total length of Soli and other district roads is 47.00 km. By reducing the total length (1953.205 - 47.00) i.e. 1906.205 km. So much so that the total length of rural roads is 19,800 km. By reducing the total length (4432.482 - 19.800) i.e. 4412.682 km.
That will be it.
