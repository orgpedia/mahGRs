Circular
Maharashtra state is 720 km. A long coastline stretches to the west of Maharashtra, and the region between the Sahyadri and the Arabian Sea is known as Konkan. Palghar, Thane, Mumbai, Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg districts are included in Konkan division. If the marine highway passing near the said coast is developed, the development of tourism along the sea coast will be boosted and all-round development of Konkan will be developed along the highway along with agriculture and fisheries and the development of civil facilities useful for tourism. By making communication easier, the area will develop rapidly in a planned manner. The Goa travel boom will make the southern state of the country a scenic route closer to Mumbai. Accordingly, in the meeting of the Cabinet Infrastructure Committee held on 25.08.2021, the Government has recommended that the Revas to Reddy Sea Highway passing through Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg districts should be improved with Four Lane / Two Lane with paved shoulder with rigid pavement as per convenience. Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation has been approved to undertake the project on “contribution deposit” basis.
From the financial year 2022-23, it has been decided to approve the following account headings for the plan to improve Revus Reddy Sea Highway with Four Lane / Two Lane with paved shoulder with rigid pavement.
