2) Under Government Decision dated 27/9/2018 paragraph no. As per the provision in 2.9 the maximum turnover of the contractor is mentioned for the last 5 years. However, taking into account the special circumstances arising out of the Covid pandemic, the turnover of the contractor should be considered for 7 years instead of the previous 5 years.
Also, a period of 7 years instead of 5 years should be considered for the equivalent price work done by the contractor mentioned in paragraph 2.9 of the government decision dated 27/9/2018, important dimensions of work to be paid and Bid Capacity. This discount will be applicable only till the end of March 2023.
