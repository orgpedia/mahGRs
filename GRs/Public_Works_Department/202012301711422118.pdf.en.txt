Introduction:
Just as the state of Maharashtra is known for its forts, Maharashtra is also known as the land of saints. Maharashtra is also blessed with ancient temples, caves and sculptures.
The 300 forts developed by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, the founder of Hindu Swarajya, are the rich heritage of Maharashtra. Out of 12 Jyotirlingas in the country, 55 Jyotirlingas are in Maharashtra alone. In the last six hundred years, the Warkari sect has created a distinct identity for Maharashtra at the national level and the pilgrimage sites of Alandi, Pandharpur and Ashtavinayak Parikrama are the lifeblood of the social/spiritual life of Maharashtra. Along with that, there are three and a half Shaktipeeths of the primordial mother deities namely Kulswamini Tuljabhavani, Mahalakshmi, Renukamata and Saptashringi of Maharashtra.
The Maharashtra government intends to give international status to the ancient temples and cave-sculptures of Maharashtra through their conservation. The restoration and conservation work of ancient temples and cave sculptures should be entrusted to the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) and for this, the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) should be provided with separate funds from the Government of Maharashtra.
