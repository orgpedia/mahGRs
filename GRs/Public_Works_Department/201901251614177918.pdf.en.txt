2.3 In case of technical defects in the service rendered through the above consultant, as well as preparation of impractical project, lack of proper survey, investigation, non-completion of work within a certain period/postponing of the move, etc., the Chief Engineer is empowered to cancel the name in the selection list.
3. Provision of Fees of Consultants/Experts:
Following instructions should be followed while paying fees to consultants/experts.
1) In the case of projects which are included in the budget, if it is necessary to appoint consultants, their fees should be included in the contingency cost of the work and should be included in the revised budget as necessary.
2) Where there is a need to appoint a consultant from the beginning, provision should be made in the budget.
3) If necessary, the cost of fees should be covered by including a separate item in the budget.
4) For repair/replacement works, as per the Chief Engineer under the Public Works Department, gross funds are kept. Similarly, funds should be reserved for this also.
5) The fees to be paid to the consultants should be paid as per the terms and conditions in the prescribed tender form.
4. Fixation of Consultancy Fee : If the consultancy fee is based on a percentage of the original project cost, the said consultancy fee should be fixed at a lump sum and the same shall be ultimately payable to the consultant. It should be mentioned in the consultant&#39;s RFQ and RFP that no increase in consultancy fee will be payable regardless of the increase in the project cost. However, if the work increases, the consultant&#39;s contract should state that the entire project will be carried out for the previously agreed fee.
5. Appointment of Consultants/Experts: The Chief Engineer should record the justification/reasoning for the appointment of Consultants/Experts by adopting the appropriate method mentioned above.
This Government Decision is being issued as per approval of Finance Department vide Informal Reference No. 226/Expenditure-11, dated 19.11.2018.
