Government Decision No: Khaksas-2025 / Q.No.950 / Roads-8
Mantralaya, Mumbai Yoo 032.
Date: 18th June, 2025.
Introduction: InvIT is a platform for investors to raise capital and invest in income generating infrastructure projects. This structure helps improve financing in infrastructure, increases asset liquidity, and provides stable returns to investors. Under the InvIT trust model, there is a general structure of a trustee overseeing the administration, a sponsor providing the assets, an investment manager, and a project manager for the effective implementation of the projects.
The Maha InvIT is proposed to be set up by the Public Works Department to streamline infrastructure, attract long-term investment in the infrastructure sector, improve the quality of road infrastructure, convert existing high-cost debt into long-term low-cost capital. InvIT is proposed for Toll, Annuity, Hybrid Beet etc.
The InvIT will be structured in compliance with SEBI regulations. The trust will comply with all governance, disclosure and operational norms to ensure transparency and investor protection.
The Public Works Department and Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation / Maharashtra State Infrastructure Development Corporation will transfer the project strengthening rights and assured assets to InvIT and the future revenue receipts will be received in a lump-sum upfront mode thereby increasing liquidity and availability of funds for various upcoming projects.
At present, 26 InvITs are registered with SEBI.
