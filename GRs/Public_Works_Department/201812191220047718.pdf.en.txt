Mantralaya, Mumbai-400032.
Dated : 19th December, 2018
Introduction:
The national flag is hoisted daily on the Ministry building. The purchase of the said national flags is done through the Public Works Department. The annual limit of expenditure for purchase of the said National Flag was Rs.10,00,000/- (Ten Lakh only) as per Public Works Department, Government Decision No.FLG 2012 / P.No.328 / Administration 4, dated 19/01/2012. National flags become unusable due to heat, wind, heavy rains and strong winds in monsoons, and in such cases, it is necessary to change the national flag immediately. Due to the increase in the cost of Khadi cloth, other chemicals, dyes, labor costs etc. used in making the national flag, the national flag suppliers have increased the prices of national flags from time to time. For this, the proposal to increase the annual financial limit for purchasing the national flag was under consideration of the government.
Government Decision:
The financial limit for the annual purchase of the national flag on the Ministry building has been increased from Rs.10.00 lakhs to Rs. 25.00 lakhs (Rupees twenty five lakhs only) is being made. The said increase is being done as per the approval given by the Financial Empowerment Committee to provide the Public Works Department as an administrative department. It will be necessary to make a provision for the said expenditure in the budget of each year.
2. The said Government Decision is being issued pursuant to the consent given by the Finance Department vide Informal Reference No. 482/2018/Regulation, dated 11/09/2018.
