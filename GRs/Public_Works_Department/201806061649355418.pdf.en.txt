Introduction
A large number of people travel on state highways and major district roads under the Public Works Department. There are no public toilets, especially for women passengers, anywhere in the state except at the roadside bus stands. Further, in line with the Right to Pee for Women, 100 km each of State Highways and District Roads under the Public Works Department will be constructed as per the decision of the Government in the above context.
It has been decided to set up 1 public convenience center at a distance. Accordingly, the action is being taken on the available sites with the Public Works Department. The government has also decided to set up toilet centres for all general passengers along the state highways and major district roads under the Public Works Department. Road side sites have been identified in various districts to set up these toilets and allied facilities. Some private entrepreneurs, financial institutions, charitable organizations have expressed their willingness to build such toilet centers at their own cost. Accordingly, it is under consideration of the government to allow Central Public Sector Enterprises (PSUs), private companies, private individuals, banks, financial institutions, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to set up and maintain public convenience centers at their own cost along the roads of the state.
After a detailed study, the government is taking the following decisions in this regard.
