Read : 1) Govt Circular No: Miscellaneous-2009/P.No.10/Raste-1, dated 23.07.2009 2) Circular No: Muapu/Ka-2 of Chief Engineer, S.B.P. Dept., Pune / buildings /5940/2017, dated 17.10.2017
Introduction: Construction of government buildings, roads and bridges is undertaken on a large scale through the Public Works Department. The dimensions of the concrete elements in the said construction are significantly higher
are Therefore, there has been a huge increase in the demand for the component of concrete i.e. mainly sand in this case. The demand for construction sand is increasing inversely with the available natural sand. As a result, illegal mining of sand has increased and obstructing the natural flow of rivers and streams has increased. In such a situation, reducing the use of natural sand in construction and instead increasing the use of artificial sand is orderly and it is the need of the hour.
In this regard, the following instructions have already been issued under the government circular dated 23.07.2019 regarding the use of artificial sand in the construction being undertaken through the Public Works Department.
However, it has come to the notice of the government that the use of artificial sand has not increased as much as it should and due to non-availability of natural sand, road and building works have been delayed. Also, in order to strictly comply with the conditions of the notification dated 29.03.2016 issued by the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate change regarding the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate change construction and demolition waste management rules 2016, the use of artificial sand in the construction of roads, bridges and buildings. The government is considering making the use mandatory to some extent. Accordingly, the following instructions are being given through this circular.
