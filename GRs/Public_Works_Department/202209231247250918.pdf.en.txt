According to the decision taken by the Government on 20.12.2019, Rs.8,500.00 Crores were expected to come from the Government by March, 2022 through direct equity. Also, out of Rs.6,396.18 crore, Rs.4,000.00 crore was expected to come from the interest on the loan during the construction period. (The total interest was expected to decrease by Rs. 2,396.18 crore.) However, as of March, 2022, only Rs.

Considering all these aspects, as per the government decision dated 20.12.2019, the amount of Rs.4000 crore fixed for the interest on the loan during the construction period is certain to increase.

If the remaining amount of Rs.4,000.00 crore is not paid on time, the interest amount on the loan during the construction period is expected to increase further till the completion of the project.
In order to improve the financial feasibility of this project and as per the terms and conditions in the Financing Documents, the government is expected to pay the increased amount of interest on the loan during the construction period.
