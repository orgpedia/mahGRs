Government of Maharashtra
Public Works Department,
Government Decision No. Miscellaneous-2018/P.No. 150/ Building-2
Mantralaya, Mumbai 400 032
Date : 16 January, 2019
Preface: Maharashtra Public Works Accounts Code para no. 2.1.1 mentions about payment of advance amounts. The term &#39;advance&#39; means an amount paid to the contractor on current account for work done but not measured by him. In the Maharashtra Public Works Accounts Code paragraph no. 10.2.21 prohibits payment of advance amount to the contractor as per rule. However, in the following exceptional circumstances advance payments to contractors are mentioned.
1) In the case of a contractor whose contract is for ready-made construction, it is mentioned that the contractor may be granted an advance on the security of goods brought to the site.
2) Payment of advances to electricity supply undertakings under the Indian Electricity Act, 1910.
Also in the Maharashtra Public Works Accounting Code paragraph no. 10.2.22 Advances for construction actually carried out may be made on the certificate of a responsible officer (not below the rank of a Sub-Divisional Officer) to the extent of the amount of construction for which payment has been made. And the officer issuing such certificate shall be held personally liable for any over-provision on the construction resulting therefrom. However, in no case shall the final award be made without detailed calculation.‚Äù
As per the above provision, action is being taken to pay the advance amount to the contractor at the regional level. However, it has now come to the attention of the government that the provisions of the Maharashtra Public Works Accounts Code for payment of advance to the contractor are being misused.
Accordingly, the following instructions are given: Government Decision: 1) Paragraph no. 10.2.22 The provision of advance provision to be made for construction actually carried out is hereby repealed.
Accordingly, henceforth the award of the construction actually carried out should be done only after taking complete measurements and fulfilling the provisions of the rule book of the Public Works Department. Henceforth, payments for construction, electrical or other works should not be provided under any circumstances without taking detailed measurements of the actual work done (Work done but not measured).

Photographs of the materials should be taken along with the longitude and the payment should be made after uploading the same on the website of the Public Works Department and the Executive Engineer himself checking the website and attaching such certificate along with the payment. Secured advance should not be given in the month of March. These orders are applicable to contracts B-1, SBD, C. These provisions shall not apply to EPC and HAM contracts.
