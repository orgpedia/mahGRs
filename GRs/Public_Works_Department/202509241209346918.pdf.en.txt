Government Circular No. Scheme-2025 / No.33 / Neo-1A
Madam Cama Marg, Martyr Rajguru Chowk,
Mantralaya, Mumbai-32.
Date: 24th September, 2025
The Proposal: -
A large number of proposals are received at the government level to include in the budget the works of roads and bridges in the Public Works Department.
These proposals are included in the budget without separate scrutiny at the government level due to the time frame of the budget work as per the prevailing procedure. As a result, at present, the government is receiving a large number of proposals for revised administrative approval and the process of granting revised administrative approval to such proposals is a waste of time. As a result, the projects have to be extended and the cost of these projects, as well as the original scope and other project-related aspects, is greatly inflated.
Under various new schemes of road development (HAM, ADB, etc.) Road construction projects have been taken up on a large scale, however, due to grant of projects without thorough verification of land availability, Forest Department No Objection Certificate in case of requirement, private land acquisition, project prioritization, etc., there are various impediments in actual implementation of these projects. For these reasons, the project is getting delayed, affecting the quality of the project. Also, due to such factors, there has been a huge increase in court cases.
It's happening.
New residential / office building projects to be taken up at a cost of Rs. The directions regarding submission of proposals with an estimated cost of over ₹15 crore to a committee headed by the Chief Secretary were issued by the Planning Department in Government Circular No. SASMA-2010 / P.No.48 (Part-I) / Ka. 1461, D. 11.06.2018
