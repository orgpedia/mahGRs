The Public Works Department mainly executes other works incidental to road bridges on major district roads, state highways and national highways, as well as departmental and other departmental building works for residential and non-residential buildings. Apart from this, rope way, airplane runway and construction of temporary or permanent helipad etc. are also done by Public Works Department. For all these public purposes, government land is intended to be worked on land owned by the Public Works Department. Also if it is not, the land owned by the department in which the building is located or the department from which the work is ordered is intended to be available. Apart from this, limited funds are made available to the officers of the Public Works Department in the form of deposits or on the government financial system of the Government Finance Department from the Collectors, Chief Executive Officers of Zilla Parishads and Commissioners or Directors of various other government authorities. It is intended that the land required for the construction of all these small and big works will be owned by the government while carrying out various types of public utility and public purpose works from this fund.
However, looking at the various references received from the sectoral level, it has been pointed out by the Government that while preparing the budget for administrative approval, it is not verified whether the land required for the work is owned by the Government or how. Despite the very competent authorities of the rank of Branch Engineer / Sub-Divisional Engineer / Executive Engineer / Superintending Engineer and Chief Engineer at the zonal level, while preparing the actual budgets for the original administrative approval, the budgets should be prepared only if the government land is available, despite the clear orders of the government, these orders are being repeatedly violated. As a result, the government has to bear the cost of crores of rupees due to various claims regarding land acquisition. It has also been pointed out that in some cases land acquisition proposals are submitted even when the land is not required and then the land cannot be used by the Public Works Department. In all such cases, the Public Works Department is facing a very difficult situation while taking decisions.

Often due to the Land Acquisition Act and the various prevailing rules framed by the Revenue Department regarding land acquisition, the cost of land acquisition has increased to a great extent. Also, the government has to bear the burden of interest due to long delay in some court cases. It has been pointed out that in at least 25 to 30 cases, due to the delay in reporting this matter to the government from the sectoral level, if the financial provision is not made available in due time, there is a possibility of confiscation of government property and issuance of warrants. Also, in the case of some regional divisions, contempt of court has also been faced with such contempt petitions.
Due to this, the following strict instructions are being given to all officers from Branch Engineer to Chief Engineer after studying all these cases thoroughly. In case of disobedience of these instructions, all engineers should take note that immediate suspension / disciplinary action will be taken against the concerned engineer without conducting any departmental inquiry after visual verification of the level at which it has taken place and written acknowledgment of the note to the Working Session Officer, Roads -7, should be sent in writing to Public Works Department, Government of Maharashtra.
Instructions
1. If the officers of the Public Works Department ask for maps and estimates for government approval by the department or the Collector&#39;s Office or other system, the place where work is to be done is reserved by the concerned authority for public purposes, and the same. left Ensure that it is owned by the department or Govt. If the land is owned by the government and permission is given by the concerned department, the budget should be prepared for obtaining administrative approval.
2. Often the District Planning Committee (DPC) or other deposit schemes implemented under the head of 2515 or through the Collector, after giving technical approval, the estimates are sent to the Collector for administrative approval. All these works are mostly not connected to major district roads or state roads. If all such works are to be carried out on rural roads or other urban roads, the Technical Sanctioning Officer should ensure that the land of the place where the work is to be carried out is in the possession of the concerned maintenance and repair agency appointed by the District Collector or not. Deputy Engineer, Executive Engineer, Superintending Engineer and Chief Engineer have the authority to grant technical approval. Therefore, while submitting the estimates, it will be the responsibility of the officer whose signature will be submitted to ensure that the work place of the officer is owned by the government or not.
It will be the responsibility of the Technical Sanctioning Officer, that while giving the technical sanction, he should check that the work concerned will be carried out on Government land and so in the technical sanction order.

It should be mentioned carefully. A budget with technical approval and administrative approval by the competent authority shall not be considered as a valid budget unless accompanied by such certificate.
3. If any works of roads, bridges, buildings and other works assigned by other bodies are to be done on private land, unless the said land is acquired in accordance with the prescribed process or as per the procedure prescribed by the Revenue Department and compensation is paid to the concerned persons and in writing in the name of the Land Public Works Department or the Competent Authority 7/ 12. Technical approval should not be given until the property card is recorded on it. If such technical approval is granted, it will not be valid and consequently the respective authorities will be personally liable for various future claims of land acquisition. It should be strongly noted that if the budget for administrative approval and technical approval is wrong, all responsibility for it will remain with the concerned zonal authorities.
4. In the already given suggestion, if land acquisition is to be done for any work of the Public Works Department, a separate item of land acquisition should be included in the budget and only after the land acquisition is completed, detailed maps and budgets of the main work to be done on it such as building/road/bridge should be prepared and submitted to the government for administrative approval. Under no circumstances should government work be carried out on private land after taking possession of the land in advance.
5. If the Collector or the concerned agencies or the people&#39;s representative of the district insists, the land on which the work is to be done should be taken from the owner of the land for public purpose free of cost to the Public Works Department. Also, the purchase form for free purchase of land should be registered with the respective sub-registrar (as stamp duty is waived on such purchase form, stamp duty should be applied). And after that those lands should be altered and registered in favor of Collector/Public Works Department or Government of Maharashtra and only then further work should be done on such government owned land.
6. After the government includes the land acquisition work in the budget, the land acquisition process should be implemented by the revenue department and after paying the full compensation in the land acquisition process, and also mentioning in writing that there is no complaint about the compensation of the concerned parties, the case should be finalized and the land should be taken over by paying the full compensation to the respective landowners without appeal through the revenue system. . While taking possession of the land, the zonal authorities should ensure that the name of Public Works Department is required on the 7/12 of the land and the property card. In case of land acquisition, if the land holder is not willing to provide the land in some places, if the land acquisition has to be done in such places, then it should be checked whether the road can be diverted to another place instead of construction of roads, bridges, buildings at that place or how. Otherwise, the government has to pay a large amount of increased expenses and interest due to court cases in such cases. So where for road, bridges or building

Work should be avoided where concerned landowners are not ready. In such places, alternative road structure should be prepared and efforts should be made to work on it.
7. However, despite taking all the above precautions, even if the owner/landholder of the private land is not willing to take over that land, it is in the interest of the government and if it is mandatory, the land acquisition process should be completed as per the prescribed procedure before working in such a place. As soon as the judgment in this regard is announced, the amount of the judgment should be made available from the government and deposited with the revenue system and care should be taken to ensure that court cases do not happen again by counseling the concerned landowners through the revenue system. However, if court cases arise during land acquisition in such a manner or if the concerned person goes to court, the regional authorities should inform the government immediately in order to present the side of the government competently in that case. Nowadays whats app, e-mail and other means of communication are available. (Concerned branch engineers should contact all senior engineers in such court cases and all engineers should take the initiative to see that the case is settled as soon as possible and the government incurs minimum cost.) In such cases, appropriate advice and help of government lawyers should be taken if necessary. If it is not available, the services of various legal advisers in the government decisions of the special counsels appointed by the Law and Justice Department should be taken with the prescribed fee and it should be seen that the government does not suffer loss by vigorously fighting the court case. As this wastes a large amount of time and energy of the officials, it is hereby reiterated that in any case, in case of land acquisition of private land, if the concerned person is reluctant to acquire the land, then the preferred option will be to find another place and construct roads/bridges/buildings after acquiring the land. It may be noted that in the current situation, responsibility will now be fixed at the level of Executive Engineer and Superintending Engineer and after a thorough scrutiny of the affairs of the board in which such increased expenditure will be incurred, the responsibility will be determined at the level at which the delay has occurred.
8. A separate electronic digital register should be created for the divisional office and board office (if staff are not available due to vacancies at the regional level, services of contractual data entry operators should be provided). The said register along with its summary should be submitted every month to Karyasana Officer, Roads-7, Public Works Department, Government of Maharashtra on email id dord7.pwd@maharashtra.gov.in. Why this mail? A, The Superintending Engineer should confirm whether Roads-7 has read it or not over the phone or by telemessage. Also keep records of such confirmation.
On the basis of this record, a case-wise review will be conducted from the government level on the fourth Friday of the last week of every month and the instructions regarding the action to be taken in the case will be sent to the Secretary (Roads), Secretary (Construction Works) or the concerned Deputy Secretary from the Government level through telephone/mail/VC and that If not present Karyasan Officer, Road-7 will give.
