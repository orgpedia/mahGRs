Preface: To implement the Hybrid Annuity Scheme in the state on the lines of the Hybrid Annuity Model of the Central Government for the overall development of the roads in the state for the improvement of roads on a large scale. It has been approved by a government decision on November 29, 2016. Accordingly, a total of 195 works were budgeted. Some of these works have been excluded as the related roads are included in the Central Government&#39;s National Highway Scheme. Apart from these works, as per requirement and as per the demand of Honorable Assembly Members, the matter of inclusion of works under Hybrid Annuity Scheme was under the consideration of the Government. Due to low response to the tenders for the works undertaken in this regard, some fundamental changes were made through Government Decision No.3 under reference. Also, through the government decision of reference no. 4, the cabinet has constituted its sub-committee for the control of this project and also to include some changes or works in this plan. The sub-committee has allowed the inclusion of the following works under the Hybrid Annuity Scheme as per its terms of reference.
These works are being included under the Hybrid Annuity scheme through the following government decision.
Government Decision: After scrutinizing the proposal received before the Cabinet Sub-Committee, the Sub-Committee has approved the inclusion of the following 7 works under the Hybrid Annuity Scheme.
