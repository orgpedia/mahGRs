Government Decision No.- Sabanj-2018/P.No.32/M.V.-1,

Government decision
The department receives many requests regarding providing land for erecting statues in the premises of rest houses and government offices under the jurisdiction of the Public Works Department of the state.
Considering the context of the said demands, the following points have been observed:
1) Even though the space demanded for the statue is not required at present, if space is required for a project or an office of the Public Works Department in the future, the space is not available and at that time the government has to rent a private space and the government has to bear the financial burden.
2) Sometimes the desecration of the statue by a social activist creates a disturbance in law and order. In such a case, there is a possibility of hurting the sentiments of some groups and due to this, sometimes agitations are also made.
3) Since the said statues are in the premises of the government office, there is a possibility that the security of the government buildings will be threatened if there is a protest over the statue.
Taking into account all the above matters, the Government is giving an order that henceforth the State Government has adopted a policy of prohibiting the erection of any kind of statue in the premises of Rest Houses/Government Offices under the jurisdiction of the Public Works Department.
Henceforth, the demand for erecting any kind of statue on the premises of the government office under the jurisdiction of the Public Works Department cannot be accepted.
These orders are being issued with the concurrence of General Administration Department vide their Order No.10/29, dated 09.03.2018.
