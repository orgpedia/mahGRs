Introduction:
Apegaon (T. Paithan, Dist. Aurangabad) to Kuranpimpri (T. Gevrai, Dist. Beed) R.M. 62 due to the damage of the low water level causeway on the river Godavari on this road, to find out the reasons for the damage to the said bridge, to suggest measures to prevent such an accident from happening in the future and to determine the operating system for repairing the bridge, the government referred reference no. 1 through the Government Decision of Shri. Ch. Q. Joshi, then Chief Engineer, Regional Department of Public Works, Aurangabad, appointed a study group. The said study group referred no. According to 2, the report has been submitted and the reasons for the damage of the bridge have been mentioned after the actual inspection of the bridge. Also, safety measures are suggested to avoid such accidents in future construction. It was under the consideration of the Government to issue directions at the sectoral level in accordance with the recommendations made by the study group. Accordingly, the government is now issuing the following instructions.
Circular:
1. Where the width of the river bed is 60 m. Raft Foundation should preferably not be proposed in such places. However, longer bridge length can be proposed with Raft Foundation as per the direction of Chief Engineer. Also, in such a situation the water flow velocity (Maximum Mean Compartmental Velocity) as well as the possibility of sand drift etc. should also be considered.
2. While proposing a bridge with raft foundation, cross cut-off should be proposed only. The length of the toe wall should be sufficient and the base of the toe wall should be at least 1.50 m below the river bed level. Keep it on the room. Apron of U/S and D/S should be of gabion type and full thickness and D/S Apron should be sloped like river bed. Guideline Drawings for this have been attached as Annexure-I and Annexure-II with this circular.

3. 30 m. While constructing a vented causeway in a river/stream larger than this should be checked by the Hydraulics Sankalp Chitra Board. Accordingly, necessary amendments should be proposed in the existing Government Circulars regarding the construction of Causeway.
4. Sub-Engineer / Executive Engineer should inspect all existing Raft Foundation Bridges / Causeways immediately before monsoon and after monsoon and make necessary repairs immediately. Also, every year before monsoon and after monsoon the competent authorities should carry out regular inspection of the said bridge and submit the inspection report along with photos / videography to the Superintending Engineer / Chief Engineer. The issue of sand levy should be brought to the notice of the competent officials of the revenue department from time to time as required.
5. The issue of sand mining at the existing bridge should be included in the Masonry Register and a clear feedback should be recorded at the sub-divisional level. After the Pre-Monsoon / Post Monsoon inspection, a bridge wise report should be submitted to the senior office regarding the non-suction of sand. If it is noticed that sand has been washed away, the competent authorities should inspect the bridge by informing the senior office and ensure that proper action is taken after informing the concerned department.
6. 100 m of all existing bridges/ causeways. A circular has been issued by the Revenue Department not to mine sand on the U/S and D/S side upto the distance. In the circular, it is proposed to increase the said distance up to 500 meters and such a proposal should be sent to the revenue department. Also on all the existing bridges prominent boards should be put up in this regard saying “Sand should not be pumped”.
7. Permission should not be given in the above mentioned areas before carrying out water conservation works.
8. In addition to the recommendations of the study group, additional suggestions are given as follows:
i. Sufficiently deep foundation and soling should be provided for the cut off wall. In this, the use of Precast type cut off is encouraged.
ii. Raft foundation should not be proposed in sea bay.

iii. A river whose current speed is greater than 5 m/s. Raft foundation should not be proposed at such places.
iv. The old bridge with Raft Foundation should be inspected and if the Upstream / Downstream Apron needs to be repaired, it should be repaired on the basis of Concrete Block / Gabion.
V. Toe wall height should be kept between 900 mm to 1500 mm instead of 600 mm as per requirement.
vi. Collapsible type railing should be removed before monsoon and the same should be recorded in the masonry register.
vii. The flood level should be prominently marked on the surface of the bridge so that it is visible to all users of the bridge.
viii. Raft foundation should be taken in 1.5 m to 3 m layers of sand if the thickness of river sand is more than 3 m.
However, the zonal authorities should ensure that the above instructions are strictly followed.
The said orders will come into force from the date of Government circular.
