Introduction:
The construction of new bridges on major state highways, state highways and major district highways in the state is undertaken and completed through the Public Works Department. During the construction of these bridges, the design of the bridges is carried out through the Superintending Engineer, Sankalp Chitra Mandal after conducting a thorough survey. Based on the general layout map of the bridge prepared by them, a detailed proposal for the bridge work is prepared and administrative approval and technical approval is given to it. Tenders for works are invited in C pattern as is the practice for major bridge works. In this type of tender, the contractor prepares the aggregate of the bridges and obtains the approval of the competent authority of the Public Works Department for this concept. Bridge work is being done as per approved concept.
The objection taken by the Accountant General in some cases made the situation of the department difficult. The Public Accounts Committee has suggested in the discussion that it is necessary to reconsider the method of calling for the tender amount (Lumpsum) of the bridge work in the sample.
In this context, the issue of issuing some revised instructions was under the consideration of the government to make all the field officials aware of taking serious action regarding the bridge construction once again. After studying this matter in detail, the following instructions are being issued.
