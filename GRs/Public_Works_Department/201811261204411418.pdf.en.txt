3) In Writ Petition No. 5244/2018 of Nagpur Bench under Hon&#39;ble High Court, Bombay. Decision dated September 3, 2018.
Under the above referenced government decision, consolidated revised instructions have been issued under the e-tendering process of the Public Works Department. Also, as per the relevant government circular, some provisions have been clarified. All the detailed instructions regarding e-tendering have been given through both the above instructions.
In one case, the board declared the tender non-responsive due to non-submission of additional security deposit amount online by Superintending Engineer, Chandrapur. In this case the concerned tenderer had submitted the required additional security amount along with the tender in hard copy. As per paragraph no.2.6 of the Government Decision under reference, instructions have been given to open the hard copy of the tender in case of any difficulty in the e-tendering process. However, as the tender of the tenderer was declared non-responsive in this matter, a petition was filed by the tenderer under the writ petition no. The final judgment of Writ Petition No.5244/2018 has been given on 6th September, 2018, in which the Hon&#39;ble High Court has stated that the tenderer&#39;s failure to submit the additional security deposit amount online does not violate the essential provisions of the tender.
Taking into account the instructions given by the Nagpur Bench of the Hon&#39;ble High Court, the following revised instructions are being given regarding the additional security deposit amount in e-tenders: 1) Issue No.4.6 and Issue No. Additional Performance Security Deposit as per 5.1.1, tender envelope no. 2 is canceled by this circular and envelope no. 1 and envelope no. 2 After opening, the L-1 tenderer who submits the first minimum bid should include the condition of depositing the “Additional Performance Security Deposit” with the concerned Executive Engineer within eight days in the following tenders and further action should be taken regarding the tender. This is eight days

The term shall not be relaxed for any reason. Therefore, in such a case, the post-action approval proposal should not be submitted to the government.
2) If the first minimum tenancy (L-1) tenderer does not pay the Additional Performance Security Deposit within the above prescribed period, then the second minimum tenancy (L-2) tenderer should be asked in writing and L-2 tenderers will be willing to work at a lower rate than L-1. So their tender should be approved.
3) Paragraph No. 4.6.3 (B) of the Government Decision dated 27.09.2018 states as follows: If the rate of Dekar is less than 15%, it will be mandatory to submit two times the amount through DD for the remaining amount. E.g. 19% for lower rate (19-15=4) % X 2 = 8%)” instead
If the rate of Dekar is less than 15%, submission of double amount through DD shall be mandatory for the remaining amount. E.g. Breakdown as follows for 19% lower rate: 1% to 10% lower rate and 15% to lower rate – (15% – 10% = 5%) Also (19-15) = 4% to (4 × 2 =) 8% Thus total ( 1+5+8) = 14 % )
4) Government decision dated 27.09.2018. left Notwithstanding the superseding of the tendering provisions of the Rules, Sixth Edition, proceedings are permitted under Clause 200 of Clause (4) in respect of Raj Bhavan Mumbai/Pune.
