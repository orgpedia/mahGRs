2. Hon. The High Court, Bombay has invalidated reservation in promotion vide judgment dated 4.8.2017 in Petition No.2797/2015. The State Government has filed Special Leave Petition No. 28306/2017 in the Hon&#39;ble Supreme Court against the Hon&#39;ble High Court. The said petition is still pending. In this regard, the Law and Justice Department has opined that there is no legal problem in promoting the employees in the open category. Accordingly, the vacant posts in the open category under the promotion quota should be filled on a purely temporary basis subject to the decision of the Hon&#39;ble Supreme Court on the basis of seniority. While taking such action, every administrative department should ensure that before promoting the backward class officers/employees in the seniority list, they have not got the benefit of reservation and got the upper position in the seniority list as per the provisions of the government decision dated 25.5.2004, General Administration Department dated 29.12. 2017 letter is given.
According to the promotion of the above mentioned engineers, Hon. Subject to the final decision of the Special Leave Petition No.28306/2017 filed in the Supreme Court, the vacancy in the open category in the promotion quota is being filled on a purely temporary basis.
3. Ad Hoc promotion to a vacant post in Direct Service Quota will remain for 11 months or until Commission sponsored candidates become available, whichever is earlier. In the meantime, if the commission sponsored candidates are received, the said officers who have been promoted ad hoc will be demoted. The said ad hoc promotion is temporary and the concerned officers will not have permanent lien on the said post.
4. As the promotions of the above mentioned engineers in the selection list of 2019-20 are purely temporary in nature, they will not get any right to regularity and seniority as a result of this temporary promotion.
