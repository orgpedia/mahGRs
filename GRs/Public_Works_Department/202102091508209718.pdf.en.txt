Ministry, Mumbai 32.

Introduction:
The works of some important roads in the state have been carried out through the Public Works Department on the principle of build, use and transfer under privatization. In these projects, sometimes disputes arise with entrepreneurs. In case of delay in project work due to government procedures (land acquisition, shifting of utility lines etc.) claims are filed by the entrepreneur in arbitration/court. The hearing on the said claim takes a long time. If the result is against the government, the entrepreneur has to pay the amount demanded by him along with interest. Also, the government has to bear the cost of arbitrators&#39; fees, legal experts, lawyers&#39; fees in ongoing arbitration/court cases regarding the entrepreneur&#39;s demand. If the ongoing disputes with the entrepreneur / the financial claims made by the entrepreneur are settled by mutual consent regarding the said claims without going to arbitration / court, the possible financial loss of the government (expenses on arbitration process, cost of interest payment etc.) can be avoided. In such a case, the matter of scrutinizing the proposal in order to take further necessary action was under the consideration of the government. Accordingly the following orders are being issued: Govt Order: Build, Use and Transfer under Privatization. left If an entrepreneur files a financial claim for a project implemented through the department, the following committee is being formed at the regional level to investigate the said claim and settle the said claims by mutual consent.
