Present Status of the Temple : Presently &#39;Sri Ekvira Devasthan Trust&#39; maintains and repairs the Ekvira Devi Temple.
Through this trust, for the convenience of the devotees, a darshan rang area in front of the temple and a pedestrian bridge for the devotees to pass through the queue have been constructed in the temple premises in the past few years.
The gabhara of the temple is painted in golden color.
Steel nets and tents are erected around the temple.
The original construction of the temple is in hewn stone, its pinnacle is in the form of descending steps, which are now filled with cement mortar and painted in shendari color with a plain surface.
On the stone walls of the temple, there is paneling with tavdans carved in wood. Due to all these changes, the original form of the temple has been hidden.
The steps on the mountain are in many places broken and dilapidated, which can be dangerous in rush hour.
Encroached shops and huts are a hindrance to this historic and natural heritage site.
