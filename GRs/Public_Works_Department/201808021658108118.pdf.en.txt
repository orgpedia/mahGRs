Preface: To implement the Hybrid Annuity scheme in the state on the lines of the Hybrid Annuity Model of the Central Government for the overall development of the roads in the state for the improvement of roads on a large scale. It has been approved by a government decision on 19th November, 2016. Accordingly, a total of 195 works were budgeted. Some of these works have been excluded as the related roads are included in the National Highway Scheme of the Central Government. In addition to this work, as per the requirement and as per the demand of honorable assembly members, the matter of including the works under Hybrid Annuity scheme was under the consideration of the government. Due to low response to the tenders for the works undertaken in this regard, reference no. Some fundamental changes were made by Government Decision 3. Also, through the government decision of reference no. 4, the cabinet has constituted its sub-committee for the control of this project and also to include some changes or works in this plan.
