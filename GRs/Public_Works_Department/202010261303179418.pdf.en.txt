As a result Road Development Plan 2001-2021 in Pune district has a total length of 157.13 km of major district road grade roads. By increasing the total length (4452.9 + 157.13) i.e. 4610.83 km. Total length of Soli and other district roads is 149.13 km. By reducing the total length (2138.86-149.13) i.e. 1989.73 km.
So much so that the total length of rural roads is 8.00 km. By reducing the total length (10009.96 - 8.00) i.e. 10001.196 km. That will be it.
