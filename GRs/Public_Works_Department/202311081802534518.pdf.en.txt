Mantralaya, Mumbai - 400 032.
Date: 8th of November, 2023
Introduction- Construction and ancillary works of most of the department buildings in the state are done by the Public Works Department. However, at times, changes are suggested to the field officers of the CBD through the consumer department while starting and progressing the work. The officers and employees of the approved plan who suggest such changes are asked to work on more area than the permissible floor area and alternatively increase the construction area of the building, additional floors are asked to be constructed, works of higher standard specifications than permissible specifications are asked to be done, a large increase in furniture work is asked to be done, construction of internal roads and fencing, work to be done on more than the approved amount. Such a thing has happened.
This was also discussed at the high-level committee meeting. All field officers have been given clear instructions not to make such changes as on 13.12.2022. However, as it was found that the instructions were not being implemented effectively, the matter of disseminating the revised guidelines was under the consideration of the Government.
Government decision -
The following guidelines are being circulated regarding the changes to be made in the approved plans and maps after granting administrative approval to the building constructions: 1. The type plans prescribed for the construction of the buildings as well as the maps and plans approved by the High Level Committee of Secretaries should not be changed. Also, if it is necessary to make changes in these maps and plans according to the available space, the government will decide. The changes should be incorporated with the approval of the Scrutiny Committee constituted as per 08.06.2016, but there should not be any change/ increase in the area of construction, specification of building material and administrative approval cost.
(2) If any change is suggested by the Consumer Department, there is an increase in the area or after the change, an additional amount has to be paid in terms of the tender and alternatively there is an increase in the working hours, such changes should not be made without the written order of the Secretary/ Principal Secretary/ Additional Chief Secretary at the Government level of the Consumer Department.
(3) If the expenditure involved in preparing the financial analysis of the change to be made on the demand of the consumer account exceeds the financial limit specified in the bill, the consumer account shall be liable to pay such expenditure.

to be informed. Without the consumer's approval of the increase in price, no incremental work should be actually carried out.
(4) If there is any substantial change in the original design and plan approved by the High-Level Secretary Committee due to the increased work, the Consumer Office should be informed once again after obtaining the approval of the High-Level Secretary Committee and such increased work should not be implemented without its approval.
5. The tender process should be carried out by aggregating all the aspects included in the administrative approval. Under no circumstances should the work be interrupted. If it is mandatory to demolish the work in some exceptional circumstances, in such cases, the proposal with detailed reasons should be submitted to the government and further action should be taken only with the approval of the government.
2) Follow the instructions carefully.
3. It may be noted that disciplinary action against all concerned will be taken if proposals for revised administrative sanction are found to have been received by the sanctioning authority in violation of the above instructions in the subsequent period.
