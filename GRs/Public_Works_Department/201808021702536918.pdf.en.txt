At least 100 km for this scheme. Due to lack of response to the tenders which were called with length, at the government level, Mr. After the meeting held by the Chief Minister, these changes have been made in accordance with the government decision No. 3 referred to in the form of the scheme. Subsequently, responses to the tenders invited have been received and out of the total 137 packages, 80 packages have received tenders and their LOAs have been issued. However, it was brought to the notice of the government that since the pre-condition of financial close with the related lending bank before starting the work (Appointed Date) is included in the tender, there are difficulties in taking loans from various banks. Accordingly, at the government level, Mr. Under the Chairmanship of Chief Minister On November 27, 2018, a meeting was held with all the bank heads. In this meeting as well as in various other meetings, State Bank of India had suggested some amendments in the Concession Agreement of the said scheme. After exchanging views on these suggestions at the government level, as there will be no major changes in the basic approval of these tenders and as there will be no financial burden on the government, the issue of government approval of these changes was submitted to the cabinet sub-committee through the government decision No. 4 established by the government and after considering all these matters, the sub-committee Approved with some changes.

Government Decision: Hon. As approved by the Cabinet Sub-Committee, it is intended to establish a Limited Liability Company/Limited Liability Partnership in the tenders issued by the Government with necessary funding advice and sign a Concession Agreement with this SPV by the entrepreneur and the Executive Engineer. However, it has been observed that few major entrepreneurs want to start working on their own financial equity. In cases where entrepreneurs want to open their company&#39;s escrow account and work on their own financial strength (Own Equity), permission is being given to the executive engineers to sign the Concession Agreement with the main entrepreneur. The concerned Chief Engineer of the Regional Division should allow such Escrow Account to be opened. The Executive Engineer is authorized to pay the entrepreneur after the work is done as per the following terms and conditions of the tender after depositing the equity to the entrepreneur from his own financial sources in such Escrow Account.
2) Under Hybrid Annuity, as per the terms of the tender, the matter of setting up a special vehicle company (SPV) and approving its proposal from the government is in progress at the regional level. Considering the extent of post acceptance proceedings, the Chief Engineer of Public Works Department is being authorized to approve the Special Performance Vehicle (SPV) for these works after obtaining necessary legal advice so that there is no delay and immediate commencement of the works.
The Chief Engineer should carry out necessary scrutiny at the regional level and approve the SPV as soon as necessary and inform the Government of the same.
3) Among the entrepreneurs given LOA by the government, those entrepreneurs who want to work on their own financial strength (Equity). For such entrepreneurs, as mentioned in paragraph 1, after opening an Escrow Account and depositing their Equity, the Executive Engineer is authorized to deposit half of the Government&#39;s 60% participation i.e. 30% in this Escrow Account. The Executive Engineer is authorized to pay the amount to the entrepreneur as per Milestone as per tender clause 23.4 after spending the funds from this Escrow Account to the entrepreneur.
4) Hon. As agreed by the sub-committee of the Cabinet, the tender clauses should be changed as mentioned in Annexure-A in the future tender (Concession Agreement). The above changes should be inspected by the Chief Engineer himself with personal attention. In the tenders where the tenders have been invited, the above items should be included in the CSD (Common Set of Deviations) as an addendum by the government and the further tender process should be implemented. The Chief Engineer should ensure that in future all tenders of Hybrid Annuity contain revised tender clauses mentioned in Annexure-A.
Otherwise, the financial closure will not be done on time by the bank and the works will not be able to start. To avoid this, the tender clause should be changed as above.
5) Hon. As agreed by the Cabinet Sub-Committee, if the Tender Clause 23.4, Clause 31.3 and Clause 23.8 of the tenders accepted at the Government level are amended as mentioned in Appendix-A, there is no need to change the tender clause in such accepted tender.
If there are no amendments in the tender clause as mentioned in Annexure â€“ A then such Concession Page 2 of 6
