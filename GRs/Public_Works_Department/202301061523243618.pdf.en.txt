As a result the total length of major district road grade roads in Ratnagiri district in the Road Development Plan 2001-2021 is 11,100 km. By increasing the total length (2014.375 + 11.100) i.e. 2025.475 km. So much so that the total length of rural roads is 11.100 km. By reducing the total length (6553.100-11.100) i.e. 6542.00 km. That will be it.
