Circular
A 20-year road development policy is currently in place with a view to the social and economic development of the state. This 20-year road development plan is determined by the Public Works Department. It determines the policy for development of rural roads, other district roads, major district roads and state roads in the state. Accordingly, proposals for upgrading these roads are handled by the Public Works Department.
The responsibility of maintenance and repair of rural roads and other district roads lies with the Village Development Department. However, no consideration is given to the financial aspect of the Village Development Department while giving the status of roads which are under the responsibility of the Village Development Department through the Public Works Department. This is the Rural Development Department
The financial liability of the department is being increased as the roads under it are being upgraded without the consent of the department.
As per the earlier procedure, all the roads in the state were being maintained and repaired by the Public Works Department. However, the administrative powers and duties of the Zila Parishad are enumerated in Section 100 of the Zila Parishad and Panchayat Samiti Act, 1961. 50 of the First Schedule to the said Act, the subject of construction, maintenance and repair of rural roads, other district roads and bridges thereon is referred to the District Council. This means that rural roads and other district roads in the state are owned by the Zilla Parishad and the Zilla Parishad has the full responsibility of maintaining and repairing these roads. Accordingly, as the matter of maintenance and repair of rural roads and other district roads comes under the purview of the Rural Development Department, the cases regarding the declaration of unclassified roads as rural roads and their numbering and the status of rural roads as other district roads are taken up by the Rural Development Department.
