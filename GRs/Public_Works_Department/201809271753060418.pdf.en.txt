2. E-Tender Announcement Under the Public Works Department, various departments of the government as well as the roads, bridges, buildings and other ancillary constructions under the Public Works Department and the existing roads, bridges and buildings are repaired. In the present system, by publishing an e-tender notice for works worth Rs.3.00 lakhs, the lowest level tenderer/contractor in the tender received accepts his e-tender and the commencement order is issued with the conditions to perform the works within the prescribed time frame in the e-tender.

3. ACTION TO BE TAKEN BY THE TENDER AUTHORITY BEFORE OPENING OF E-TENDERS 3.1 Complaints have been received in the past from many reputed contractors that tenders were not made available to them. Now any contractor can download the tender set from anywhere and submit the tender from the website written in the e-tendering system. However the legality of the tender shall be subject to the terms and conditions mentioned in the tender. If necessary, the tender should be extended by the contractor.
3.2 Generally tenders received at Executive Engineer level do not have provision for pre-tender meeting. In such a place, the Executive Engineer should call all the tenderers/contractors who have submitted tenders to him before the opening of the tender, at the office on the date of opening of the tender or immediately within three days at a designated time. The concerned contractor should immediately obtain a certificate that all the tendering process carried out so far has been done transparently and that there is no complaint from the concerned contractor regarding the completed e-tendering process till Bid lock date. If the contractors present refuse to give such certificate, it should also be recorded. If the opposition of the concerned contractors is unwarranted and not in accordance with the rules, the reasons should be recorded. Absence of contractors who have been absent should be noted on the record. The Executive Engineers should mention on the record that no other person or System Integrator / Service provider or Website Coordinator has interfered in the tender process in the website and that due diligence has been taken by all concerned in this process and only then the tender should be opened in the presence of the maximum number of contractors who pay the tender. .
4. Actions to be taken by the tender authority while opening e-tenders 4.1 Opening of tenders in the absence of contractors is a matter that creates suspicion and violates transparency, so it is mandatory to open tenders in the presence of majority of contractors. If for some reason the majority of the contractors are not present, the opening of such tenders should be avoided. Envelope no. 1 After scrutinizing all the documents therein, all findings regarding eligible/ineligible contractors, all reasons for eligibility/ineligibility should be communicated to all concerned contractors and all these reasons should be published on the website of Public Works Department. If the facility to publish such reasons is available on the tender portal / service provider&#39;s portal, then all the reasons should be mentioned there as well. In particular, all contractors who have been disqualified should be clearly informed of the reasons for their disqualification.
Page 14 of 26
# Page 15
Govt Decision No: CAT/2017/Q No 08 / IMA-2
If the contractors have any doubts regarding the reason for disqualification in this regard, the authorities should clear the doubts by holding a physical hearing before opening the tender. It should be mentioned in the record. In addition to the contractor, Mr. If they have grievance redressed with Chief Engineer, Secretary (Roads), Secretary (Works) and Principal Secretary (Left) of the Department, after submitting the grievance redressed and taking a revised decision, and publishing the same on the website, informing the ineligible contractors through e-mail. Only later envelope no.2 will be opened. Provision of the above format should be made in the tender announcement mahhhatender.in and in the tender document.
In this manner, till now the selection process has been completely transparent and no one has complained about the tender process. 2 (Tender Rate Envelope) should be opened. If the contractor is not present, the contractor should be directly contacted and suggested to be present and preferably in his presence envelope no. 2 should be opened.
If the e-tender is less than 5 contractors, envelope no.2 should be opened in the presence of at least 2 contractors. E Tender If the number of contractors is more than 5 in the presence of at least 3 contractors envelope no. 2 should be opened so that everyone knows the price of their receipts in front of the contractor. Due to such working method, public works department officials will not be suspected unnecessarily. If for some reason the contractor is not present after giving instructions, the tender should be opened in front of 3 other witnesses.
4.2 Tenders received and opened at board level have provision for pre-tender meeting. In such pre-tender meeting maximum number of contractors should attend and see that they raise issues regarding the tender draft of Public Works Department. If there is no feedback from the prospective bidder in the pre-tender meeting, such feedback should be obtained from him in writing and saved on record.
Resolution of points in the notice or points raised by the contractor, necessary changes to be made in the tender should be made within 4 days with the approval of the Competent Authority. Nowadays, all the fast communication tools like audio visual media, video conferencing, e-mail are available.
Therefore, without wasting time in correspondence, CSD should promptly approve the tender by using all these tools and upload it on the website of the service provider within two days. The Chief Engineer, Public Works Regional Department should check the necessity in this case and grant the extension of time highlighting the related reasons.
A certificate that there is no complaint in the process till receipt of the tender should be obtained from all the contractors submitting the tender. Only then envelope no.1 should be opened. After scrutinizing all the documents in envelope no.1, the findings regarding the eligibility / ineligibility of the contractor should be published on the tender website as well as mahapwd.com. All eligible / ineligible contractors should be informed about their eligibility / ineligibility. All disqualified contractors say within 5 days

Govt Decision No: CAT/2017/Q No 08/Ema-2
Resolve it on record and publish it on the website and only then open envelope no.2.
4.3 Procedure regarding Single Tender:- In the interest of full transparency, fair competition and government under the e-tender system, it is not in the interest of the government to receive a single tender in tender acceptance. Therefore, the following orders are being issued confirming all previous government orders/notifications/decisions regarding the receipt of a single tender: &quot;Single Tender&quot; means that only one tender has been received after publication of the tender notice or despite the receipt of many tenders, technical envelope no. 1 All such tenders will be treated as single tender if all other contractors are disqualified and only one contractor has qualified for the tender. In respect of all these single tenders it is ordered that such tenders received, envelope no. 2 should be immediately rejected without opening and fresh tenders should be invited immediately. However, no changes should be made in the original tender in this regard. If there is no change in the original tender, the renewed demand will be treated as a second demand. After such demand, if a single tender is received again, the tender should be opened and further action should be taken according to the prevailing procedure. There is no need to call for re-tenders in respect of such tenders. If only two tenders are received at the time of first requisition, three eligible tenders are not received and therefore the two tenders received are rejected as per the CVC rule. If two qualified tenders are received, they should be opened so that there is no wastage of time and the work is done on time. If a tender is received at a rate higher than the prevailing price list, the tender should be submitted for approval with full support at the next senior level. If these tenders are not acceptable, they should be canceled at the competent level and the tender conditions should be re-examined and re-tenders should be called for by relaxing the conditions to obtain competitive rates.” According to why a single tender is being received, after studying the terms and conditions of the tender and the budget based on which the tenders have been invited, after studying the items in the budget and ascertaining the rates of the items, if necessary, with the approval of the Chief Engineer of the concerned Regional Division, make the necessary changes in the draft tender and the quality of work. And the Chief Engineer should take a decision regarding relaxation of some conditions and if the increase in the budget price is due to rate revision, ensuring that the quality does not deteriorate. The Chief Engineer should keep this decision on record. Thereafter such changed tenders should be publicized and called back. After receiving such a request, if a single tender is received for the first time, it should be rejected and the tender should be invited for the second time. If a single tender is received for the second time, the competent committee shall have the power to accept it up to the estimated rate. The higher rate tender should be submitted to the competent authority for approval.
As per these instructions, the Maharashtra Public Works Rules shall be deemed to have been amended accordingly.

4.4 If it is found that at least three or more than three tenders have been submitted during the first bid under the e-tendering system, envelope number (1) (Technical envelope) should be opened at the time fixed by the e-tendering authority. If only one contractor is found eligible after scrutinizing the documents through the technical envelope, the said tender should be rejected without opening the envelope no. The duration of technical envelope scrutiny will be limited to two days only.
If only one qualified tender is received during the first bidding of tenders for urgent works, such tender should be rejected immediately and re-tendering should be called for within a short period of time. In order to avoid wastage of time, these tenders should be advertised in the newspapers in which they were previously published and should be published on the same website. If 1 or more tenders are received at the time of requisition, further action should be taken after opening those tenders. At present, looking at the various tenders, it is found that there is at least 15 to 30 days in opening the envelope no.1, at least one to one and a half month in opening the tender and another one to one and a half month to submit the tender acceptance proposal at the competent level. To avoid this wastage of time, the tender proposal should be submitted promptly at the competent level. If the rates received in the tender are not found to be competitive in respect of such tenders received, the tender opening authorities and the competent accepting committee should try to reduce the rates by negotiating with the contractor submitting the lowest offer. Chief Engineer should negotiate for government level tenders. If the tender rates received are higher than the budget and the contractor is not willing to reduce the tender rates, they should be rejected and the competent authority should re-tender if necessary after reviewing the technical approved budgets. At present, all the tenders received at the government level are being received at low rates. Therefore, the trend of tenders in all districts should be recorded by the Superintending Engineer/Chief Engineer who approves the tenders and if the tenders are received at a higher rate than that, they should try to bring the tender rates within the above limit by negotiating with the respective lowest rate contractors before accepting them. If this is not possible and if the concerned Executive Engineer / Superintending Engineer considers the rates received to be correct, his statement should be placed on record and thereafter such tenders should be accepted by the competent authority.
4.5 Precautions to be taken by Tender Opening Officers and Tender Verification Committee while scrutinizing and evaluating technical envelope no.1 of tenders: In the current practice, tenders are opened at the level of Executive Engineer and Superintending Engineer and scrutiny of technical envelope no.1 of such tenders Executive / Superintending Engineer also takes decision regarding opening of Envelope No.2 at their level. This procedure is being modified and henceforth, these tenders will be verified by the Tender Verification Committee as mentioned in paragraph No. 5.1.4 below.
Page 17 of 26
# Page 18
Govt Decision No: CAT/2017/Q No 08/Ema-2
The tender verification committee should work as follows.
4.5.1 Notice of tender opening should be given to all contractors and tenders should be opened in their presence. If some contractors are unable to be present on the day of tender opening, their written request should be kept on record. But in any case the tenders should be opened in the presence of majority of the contractors.
4.5.2 After the opening of tenders, the Tender Verification Committee shall scrutinize the tenders and if any doubt arises regarding the eligibility/ineligibility of the tenders, it shall be mandatory for them to seek clarifications from the contractors especially on the following points.
(1) Registration documents (2) Clarifications regarding Power of Attorney (3) Errors in Bank Guarantee (4) Explanations if there are ambiguities and errors in technical and financial statements submitted by the contractor (5) Length and specification of bridge, similar works, buildings Height and quality criteria of work, quantities and charges of works/items in road construction (6) In case of joint venture, there is error in the agreement, not certified, agreement is not registered, share of partner is not mentioned (7) Explanation regarding error in financial balance sheet and statement ( 8) Ambiguities, ambiguities etc. in the technical envelope submitted in the proposal / terms/conditions in the document and correspondence.
In this regard the Competent Officers (Executive Engineer/Superintending Engineer) who opened the tender should correspond in writing with the concerned contractor before qualifying/disqualifying them and verify the same by getting written explanation from the contractor. Minor and unimportant condition should not disqualify the tenderer. In such a case, a written explanation should be sought from the contractor and the correct documents as per the conditions shall be obtained and placed before the committee after scrutinizing the same and taking a decision regarding the contractor&#39;s tender eligibility/ineligibility. All the records in this regard should be kept in the database and on the website and all these verification methods should be clearly mentioned in the proposal to submit the tender for acceptance.
Often a contractor who is eligible at one tender opening is also disqualified at the second tender. The possibility of collusion of the contractor (CARTEL FORMATION) cannot be ruled out. Therefore, those who are in the country / state or state. A contractor who has competently done the type of work in the department i.e. equivalent work of building for building work, equivalent work of bridge for bridge work etc. should not be disqualified from tender for minor reasons (such as PTC, Machinery, Income Tax documents, Similar work condition etc.). Such contractors, if available, should verify their previous documents and inform about eligibility and open financial envelope no.2.

5. The terms and conditions of the tender should not be changed even partially after the e-tender acceptance is published on the government&#39;s e-tender website, web portal.

Therefore, if the content or date of the e-tender is to be changed, it should be done with the prior written permission of the competent authority. While granting such approval, the letter and the reasons for the same should also be prominently published on the concerned website as well as mahapwd.com.
