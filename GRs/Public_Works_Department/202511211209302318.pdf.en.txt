Government Decision No. RMR 2025 / P.No. 123 / Roads-9
Martyr Rajguru Chowk, Madam Cama Marg,
Mantralaya, Mumbai - 400 032
Date: - 21.11.2025
The Proposal: -
Lakhs of devotees and tourists from all over the country and abroad are expected to visit Nashik during the Kumbh Mela to be held in the year 2027. Nashik was visited by more than 10 million devotees at the 2014 Kumbh Mela, while this number is expected to almost double to 20 million in 2027. In such a situation, considering the existing transport infrastructure in Nashik city and the increasing stress on public safety systems, it is very urgent to have a Nashik Parikrama route in order to manage the flow of water in Nashik city properly. This Parikrama route will reduce traffic congestion in Nashik city and improve inter-city and intra-city connectivity in Nashik city. Also, it will facilitate faster movement of people and goods, which will boost logistics, tourism and industrial growth. Accordingly, the development of the Nashik Parikrama route was under the consideration of the government.
