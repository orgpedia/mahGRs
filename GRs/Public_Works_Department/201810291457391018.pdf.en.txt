Regarding keeping order while approving rates of Non District Scheduled Items.
Government of Maharashtra
Department of Public Works
Government Circular No- 2017/P.No.11/Planning-3
Mantralaya, Mumbai 400 032,
Date:-29/10/2018.
Reference:- Government Circular No.-2017/P.No.11/Planning-3, dated 11.04.2017
Introduction:
It has been pointed out by the Government that if other works are to be done apart from the items included in the District Tariff, such rates shall be obtained at the local level and the concerned S.B. Superintending Engineer of the Board gives approval. While sanctioning such rates only local market rates are taken into consideration, the possibility of high rates of works without adequate competition cannot be ruled out. Therefore, the possibility of financial loss to the government cannot be ruled out. It has also been noticed at many places that the rates agreed by one board are directly used by other boards. Therefore, the government issued instructions on 11/04/2017 regarding bringing uniformity in the approval process. Taking into consideration the difficulties encountered in the implementation of the said instructions, all the Chief Engineers requested to change it in the meeting held on 8/10/2018. Accordingly, the following changes are being made in the government circular.
Government Order:
Further, while approving Non District Scheduled Rates as mentioned above, revised orders are being given to the Public Works Board Offices to proceed as follows.
