Mantralaya, Mumbai : 400 032
Date :- 09 August, 2019
Introduction: 2. Under the Public Works Department, it is mandatory to immediately deposit the amount of revenue collected due to collection of lease of residential/non-residential government buildings and vacant lots, lease of government buildings for residence, rest houses/observation bungalows, collection of rent/arrears of government residences.
However, it has been observed that in some cases at the zonal level, the amount deposited is not deposited in the government treasury within the prescribed period and the said amount is not reconciled. Due to the fact that it is mandatory to regularly pay the amount collected through these matters to the government treasury and there is a need to have effective control over it, the issue of issuing necessary instructions in this regard is under the consideration of the government.
Government Circular: According to Rule 8 of the Maharashtra Treasury Rules, 1968, any amount received as revenue of the State is mandated to be immediately deposited in the Government Accounts by that office. According to this, the revenue collected at the sectoral level under the Public Works Department cannot be kept out of the government accounts. In order to regularly check the amount received under the revenue deposit with the Public Works Department and keep up to date the necessary records regarding the same, the following levels are being fixed at the sectoral level.
