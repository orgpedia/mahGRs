Government Decision No.0418/ P.No.155/ 14-A,
Hutatma Rajguru Chowk, Madame Cama Marg, Mantralaya, Mumbai-32,
The date: April 27, 2018
Read: Letter No. 0318/ No. 81/14-O of the Department of Agriculture and Padum 02/04/2018
The Proposal:
The government is implementing various schemes and programmes for the welfare of farmers in the State.
In 2017-18, the" Unnat Krishi- Samriddhi Kisan" campaign has been launched. This has enabled more flexibility and streamlining in the implementation of the existing schemes of the Agriculture Department and has also succeeded in fulfilling the objective of the Government to implement the schemes of the Department in a transparent and more effective manner. The government plans to implement the scheme in 2018-19.
Under the campaign" Advanced Agriculture- Prosperous Farmers," the main objective of the current year will also be" To reduce the gap between the actual productivity of major crops and the genetic yield potential of these crops, to get more financial income from the amount of crop loan taken by the farmers, and to protect the farmers from the loss of crops due to natural disasters by involving more and more farmers under the Crop Insurance Scheme."
Under this campaign," Taluka" is being identified as a planning component for agricultural development and production enhancement in the current year. Accordingly, in order to increase the economic income of the farmers, under this campaign, efforts should be made to increase the productivity of major crops to their genetic production capacity, diversification of crops, reducing the cost of production of crops, techniques of selling farm produce to farmers keeping in mind the regular fluctuations in the market price of farm produce.
The focus of the government will be on awareness generation, promotion of agri-allied businesses, organizing farmers by farmers" producer companies in the state to take decisions on market-based agricultural production, and building the professional capacity of these companies, post-harvest handling and value addition.
In order to increase the productivity of major crops in every taluka, modern technology will be ensured and the matters to be implemented under various schemes for its promotion and publicity will be consolidated. Further, the subsidy on various inputs, implements, micro-irrigation kits and other infrastructure will be directly credited to the Aadhaar linked bank accounts of the farmers.

GOVERNMENT DECISION NO. 0418/ PR. NO. 155/14-O,
The campaign will also focus on the extensive use of information and technology in implementation.
Thus, from the coming Kharif season, the details of various components/ aspects to be implemented in all the existing schemes under the campaign" Uplift Agriculture- Prosperous Farmers" will be made available.
The matter of prescribing guidelines was under the consideration of the government, on which the government has decided as follows.
Government's decision:
1. Approval is being given for implementation of the Mission" Upliftment of Agriculture- Prosperous Farmers" during Kharif and Rabi seasons in 2018-19. The Commissioner (Agriculture) should monitor this campaign from the state level.
The main objective of this campaign will be to" reduce the gap between the actual productivity of major crops and the genetic yield potential of those crops, to get more financial income from the amount of crop loan taken by the farmers, and to protect the farmers from the loss of crops due to natural disasters by involving more farmers under the Crop Insurance Scheme."
From the current year," Taluka" is being fixed as a planning component for agricultural development and increase in production. Accordingly, the taluks in which farmers are getting less income than the loan taken for that crop due to low productivity of major crops, should be given the target of increasing productivity to the extent that the income received as per the guarantee price of the respective crops is more than the crop loan taken. Similarly, the taluks where the productivity of major crops is high and the farmers are getting more income than the loan taken for that particular crop as per the guaranteed price, they should be given a target of at least 20% increase in the average productivity of the respective crops.
In order to increase the productivity of major crops in the taluk, the following common guidelines are being prescribed to determine the allocation under various existing schemes and to consolidate the implementation of modern technologies and to implement the elements/ aspects common to each scheme.
4.1.Pic Exhibits
Crop Demonstrations are organized by the Department of Farmers' Farming as a means of technology dissemination with the aim of increasing the productivity of various crops in the state. Earlier, the inputs required for the crop demonstration were being procured by the government and supplied to the beneficiaries.

GOVERNMENT DECISION NO. 0418/ PR. NO. 155/14-O,
Demonstrations had to be held in a dispersed area. The agricultural assistants were unable to reach this large area in a dispersed form, resulting in difficulties in regular communication with all the farmers and technology dissemination. Therefore, for effective implementation of the demonstration, the following decisions are being taken: 4.1.1. From the current year, crop demonstration under all the existing schemes should be carried out in 10 hectare area, preferably continuously.
4.1.2 The Agricultural Assistant will be responsible for the implementation of crop demonstration under the schemes to be implemented in each village.
4.1.3. Each Agricultural Assistant shall be assigned a maximum of two Crop Demonstrations in a season and a maximum of 5 Crop Demonstrations in Kharif/ Rabi/ Summer season. The supervisors of all the concerned agricultural assistants should regularly visit the crop demonstrations every 15 days and guide the farmers and instruct the agricultural assistants about the activities to be carried out under the demonstrations till the next visit and submit their reports to the senior office regularly after evaluating the work done during the next visit. After visiting the crop demonstrations, the agricultural supervisors should also conduct a mock inspection in the respective villages of the matters assigned to them under various schemes. Similarly, all the concerned Circle Agriculture Officers should visit at least one crop demonstration once in 15 days and submit their report. Thus, all supervisors and Circle Agriculture Officers should make regular visits to the crop demonstrations. In this format, the Taluk Agriculture Officer has to submit a consolidated report to the District Superintending Agriculture Officer every month after compiling the report of all the crop demonstrations in the taluk. Accordingly, the Director (Extension and Training) is required to submit the consolidated report of the State during the ensuing Kharif and Rabi seasons from the month of June to the 30th of every subsequent month to the State Government.
4.1.4 There is a huge difference between the average productivity of major crops in the taluka, the highest productivity achieved by some farmers in these crops in the state, and the genetic potential of those crops determined by the university. In order to reduce this gap and increase the productivity of crops, the scientists of agricultural universities (Director, Research/ Director, Extension) should determine the modern technology for major crops in each district under the jurisdiction of the concerned agricultural university and give it to the Joint Director of Departmental Agriculture. All Divisional Agriculture Co-Directors of Yakami Agricultural University, Regional Officers of Agriculture Department Page 3 of 15

GOVERNMENT DECISION NO. 0418/ PR. NO. 155/14-O,
The technology should be determined in coordination with other institutions and to make this technology available to the farmers, the extension work and crop demonstration should be planned. The help of the farmers who have the highest production of their crops should also be taken to ensure technology.
4.1.5. Demonstrations should be carried out by groups/ groups of farmers with a total area of 10 hectares, the farmers in the group who are ready to organize the crop demonstration as per the technology prescribed by the government should be selected as beneficiaries.

It is mandatory for each farmer group to include at least 10 farmers and each farmer should be given financial benefit up to the limit of 1 acre area or such area as may be permissible under the guidelines of the respective scheme.
4.1.6 Based on the soil health cards issued to the farmers selected for crop demonstration or in the places where soil health cards are not available, the soil should be examined and the required inputs should be determined according to the report. the said provision
The scientists of the concerned agricultural universities and the concerned divisional agriculture joint directors should decide. Priority should be given to the farmers to purchase seeds through government agencies like Mahavij, National Seeds Corporation, agricultural universities, government biological laboratories (seeds and biological fertilizers and medicines etc.). In addition to these provisions
The beneficiary farmer groups of other tenders will have to buy their choice from the open market and then the subsidy will be directly credited to the Aadhaar linked bank account of the farmers in the group. Through the agriculture department, farmers should be recommended pesticides, fertilizers and medicines etc. under the name of' generic'.
4.1.7. To make the technology used in the crop demonstration accessible to all other farmers of the state who are not participating in the demonstration, visits of local farmers should be organized at the demonstration site.
4.1.8 The concerned agricultural assistants and supervisors will be responsible for conducting scientific experiments in the presence of farmers groups and agricultural supervisors for each crop demonstration, and the information about the production of crop demonstrations should be collected village-wise/ crop-wise/ revenue board-wise by the Taluk Agriculture Officers.
