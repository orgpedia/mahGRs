Government Resolution, Planning Division (Rohyo Ward), No.MagroRo-2022/ P.No.174/ Rohyo-6A, Dy. 14th December 2022
The Proposal:
The Fisheries Department has been created to increase the protein content in the diet of the people by increasing the fish resources in the state and to improve the living standards of the people by increasing their income from the fish business. For this, the Department of Fisheries is expected to develop marine as well as freshwater fisheries. The Department of Fisheries is presently implementing the following schemes under the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY): 1. Groundwater Cage Fisheries Conservation Scheme (BMSMS) 2. Groundwater and Saltwater Tank Construction, Renovation and Nivishtha Scheme (GODEPANI) 3. RAS/ Biofloc Project (GODEPANI) 4. Setting up of GODEPANI and Marine Fish Seed Production Centre (MFPC)
In the Multidimensional Poverty Index 2021 released by NITI Aayog, one-third weightage has been given to each of the disadvantaged groups related to health, education and living standards. The government should have at least one goal to bring every citizen of the country out of deprivation. The next goal will be to make every family prosperous. So that every citizen of the country can live a happy, contented and prosperous life. The Fisheries Development Department is working with the same objectives. For this, several plans and programmes are being implemented.
As per the decision taken by the Government here, the Government has implemented the Suvidha Kutumb Mission and the Holistic Village Development Scheme through convergence of schemes of MGNREGS and various departments.
Against the above backdrop, MNREGA and Fisheries Development Department will converge at the following 5 levels.
1) Think about your goals and money.
2. Farming under MGNREGA and Fisheries under MGNREGA can be said to be a combination.

3. The department should link its schemes to generate income from the drugs made under MNREGA. For example, fish seed/ training/ fishing net/ boat etc. under the scheme of Fisheries Development Department.
Convergence from the convergence of the Fisheries Development Department and MGNREGA funds, especially to maintain the ratio of 60:40.
Convergence of services of officers and employees of MNREGA and Fisheries Development Department.
Considering the total rainfall in the state of Maharashtra and the abundant potential available for fisheries development accordingly, it is possible to raise the standard of living of fishermen in the state through fish production. To achieve these objectives, the MNREGA and Fisheries Department was under the consideration of the government to prescribe the objectives, ideas, combination, scheme and modalities for implementing the scheme through convergence of manpower. The following decisions are being taken:
Government's decision:
All the employees and officers of the Fisheries Department are being directed to take up all the works which are useful for the development of fisheries resources out of the 263 works permissible under MGNREGA. Below is a list of useful features.
1. Building ponds for fisheries 2. Repair and maintenance of ponds.
3. Renovation of ponds 4. Construction of fish drying ponds 5. Construction of mini Pazar ponds and Pazar pond repair 6. Removal of silt in ponds 7. Plastic lining of ponds 8. Testing/ testing of pond water and soil
Many farms are being constructed under MNREGA. It is possible to fish in such farms by making necessary technical changes in them. This will help in increasing the income of farmers and improving their social and economic status.
Construction of farms (fish ponds).
If there is a need for aquariums when building farms, action will be taken according to the instructions. According to the issue of convergence in the MGNREGA government decision, the district level officers of the department should select 20 villages in the district and select the landholding families in the areas with good rainfall in accordance with the relevant government decision of MGNREGA.

20 villages should be called Nandadeep villages. It will be the joint responsibility of the Gram Rozgar Sevak, Technical Assistant to prepare the proposal along with all the documents for administrative approval of the application of the farmers for the farmlands (fish ponds) received in the Gram Sabha in such selected villages.
For construction of fish ponds, the size of the pond as per MGNREGA norms should be at least 45x20x3 m. The water holding capacity of the soil in the proposed farmlands should be tested. After the soil and water test report is received, if the soil test at the site has a low water holding capacity, it should be proposed to line the plastic film under the MNREGA in such farm ponds so that water can be stored in the ponds. Before selecting the site, the land and the source of water required for the aquarium will be inspected by the Fisheries Department.
It is not advisable to remove underground water (borewells, etc.) in farmlands. It means that the underground water was extracted and poured into it for evaporation. Therefore, it is being banned to pour groundwater into the farmlands taken under the MNREGA programme.
In these farms fishes of Katla, Rohu, Mrugal, Tilapia, Pangasius etc. breeding species can be reared and sold till the fish boat yard. This will definitely contribute to reducing the shortage of fishing boats in the state. Also, fish production can be taken up by conserving the above mentioned fish. However, the permission of the Fisheries Department should be obtained before the conservation of Tilapia fish.
In this way, fishing should be done as much as possible in the less available water.
Repair and maintenance of ponds.
Repair, maintenance and renovation of the fish ponds to be created should be proposed under MNREGA. This should include strengthening of bunds of ponds, removal of silt if there is silt in the pond, etc. as per the guidelines of MGNREGA.
Training- On deciding to do fish business in all the farms of the state, a large number of people will need to be trained on the nuances of fish business. For this, a WhatsApp group of people engaged in fish farming should be formed in one taluka. People will face problems. A solution will be found. Officers of the department will also be able to guide.
But farmers should learn from each other rather than being guided by officials.
Below is a list of potential problems.

How to manage fish feed at a minimum cost.
2. What are the causes of death?
3. Gathering as per requirement for availability of fish seed/ feed etc. for marketing.
There is no need to think that the work cannot be done without creating more groups.
Begin by working with your family. However, if people are inclined to form groups, they should be encouraged to do so.
