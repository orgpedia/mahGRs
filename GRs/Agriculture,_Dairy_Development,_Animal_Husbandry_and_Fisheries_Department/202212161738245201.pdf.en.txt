In order to promote fisheries in the landlocked areas of the State, supply of quality fish seed/ shrimp seed to fish farmers, fish breeders and fish farmers is essential. For this, a total of 67 centers such as 32 fish seed production centers, 32 fish seed conservation centers, 2 shrimp seed production centers and 1 shrimp seed conservation center have been established in the state. Since these fish seed centres are in a dilapidated condition and many of them are running at a loss due to their maintenance cost, establishment cost, daily expenses, etc. Under the government decision, a total of 6 centers were approved to be leased for 10 years. Also Read No. 3 Under the Government decision mentioned here, it was decided to lease out a total of 20 Government Fish Seed/ Shrimp Seed Production and Conservation Centres, 6 and 14 more, which were earlier leased out, for 15 years.
The, however. It has been observed that the contractor is not willing to invest as per the provisions of the Government Decision dated 18.01.2014, after reviewing the investment made by the contractor and the fish seed produced from the production center, the action of extending the period for the next 5 years has created doubts. Due to the same errors, some fish seed center contractors have left the contract before the deadline, while some fish seed center contractors have had to cancel their contracts due to non-fulfillment of the terms and conditions. This has led to a low response to leasing fish seed centres.

Further, as per the decision of the Government, a period of 5 years has been given for the fish seed center which is currently leased out and which was leased out as per the earlier decision of the Government to go up to the installed capacity, so it is necessary to remove this condition as the expected development of the leased center and the expected fish seed production from the fish seed production centers is not happening.
It is permissible to obtain permission for breeding of fish at fish seed centers for fisheries, along with other fishing related matters, for the breeding center in which the operation is to be carried out.
Therefore, in order to increase the production of government fish seed production and conservation centers in the state using modern technology, fish seed centers in the state should be developed through private developers. In pursuance of the proposal submitted to the Government by the Commissioner Fisheries Office under Section 4, the The matter of amending the terms and conditions in the Government Resolution dated 18/01/2014 was under consideration of the Government.
Government Decision: The Government is approving to issue a revised policy for the development of the currently leased and transferred centres in the State to the Maharashtra Fisheries Development Corporation by private developers by superseding the Government decision dated 18/01/2014.
