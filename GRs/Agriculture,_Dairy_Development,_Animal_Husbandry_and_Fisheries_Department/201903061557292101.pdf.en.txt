The Government of Maharashtra
Department of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, Dairying Development and Fisheries
GOVERNMENT DECISION NO. FAROWA-2019/ PR No. 51/13-A,
Mantralaya, Mumbai- 400 032
Date: 6th of March, 2019
Reference:- 1) Letter from the Commissioner of Agriculture No. Kriya/ Fallow-2/ Nursery. / 158/18 D. 28/01/2019.
The Proposal:
According to the report submitted by the Commissioner (Agriculture) under the reference letter, there is scope to establish a nursery as irrigation facilities are available on the area of the proposed Taluk Biz Multiplication Centre. If this nursery is established, the demand for fruit orchard cultivation under the Bhausaheb Phundkar Fruit Garden Plantation Scheme and Kalme saplings under the Maharashtra Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme will be fulfilled. In Thane, Ratnagiri and Dhule districts, the demand is mainly for mango, cashew, chikoo, guava, pomegranate, sitaphal, lemon, amla, chinch, saag, bamboo, gulmohur, ashoka, karanj etc. forest plants.
If a nursery is established, no separate posts will have to be created for this nursery. There will be no impact on any component of the same area and there will be no financial burden. If nurseries are established on these areas, the availability of grafts/ saplings to the farmers of the area will increase the area of orchard cultivation to a great extent. This will help raise farmers" income.
The area will benefit financially from the sale of saplings/ plants. As a result, local farmers in the surrounding areas will get a large number of employment opportunities, considering this, the matter of giving approval to set up a fruit orchard was under the consideration of the government.
Government Decision- Approval is being given to convert Taluk Seed Multiplication Centre into Fruit Plantation as follows:
