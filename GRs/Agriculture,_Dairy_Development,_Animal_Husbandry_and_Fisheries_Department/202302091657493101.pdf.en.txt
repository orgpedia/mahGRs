In the marine sector, different types of non-mechanical boats and different types of nets are used. Therefore, while giving financial assistance on fishing equipment, the ground water and marine sector have been considered separately. Guidelines in this regard have been issued vide Government Resolution No. Matsyavi-2010/ P.No.247, Padum-14, Dy. Issued on 28/09/2010.
In this decision, the government has decided to provide financial assistance to the economically weaker small fishermen and rafters engaged in traditional fishing in the maritime sector for the construction of non-mechanized boats up to 10 tons or the purchase of such ready-made boats in order to increase their fish production and improve their economic condition. Matsyavi 1008/ PR No.195/ Padum 14 dated 18/11/2010 for Rs. One lakh has been provided.
