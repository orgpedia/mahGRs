7. Risk Factors: The scope of risks under the scheme has been widened to include the following.
7.1.Prevented Sowing/ Planting/ Germination of crops due to adverse climatic conditions.
7.2 Mid-season Adversity (7.3) Reduction in yield from sowing to harvesting due to natural fires, lightning, hailstorms, storms, cyclones, floods, inundation of fields, landslides, droughts, rain interruptions, pests and diseases, etc.

Under this scheme, the difference between the crop-wise premium per hectare and the actual premium to be paid by the farmers will be considered as normal premium subsidy and this subsidy will be given equally by the central and state governments. The State Government insurance premium subsidy to the insurance companies will be paid through Agriculture Insurance Company of India (AIC) in various stages as per the procedure prescribed by the Central Government under the guidelines of the scheme. The subsidy amount will be paid through Public Finance Management System (PFMS) or PFMS linked system as per the information received from the National Crop Insurance Portal.

Crop wise insurance coverage factors have been notified taking into account the average yield of the last 5 years of the highest production in the last 7 years, area under the crop and available manpower for harvesting the crop in the current season and major crops in all the districts of the state. The required crop cutting experiments have been planned for all the notified crops as per the yield estimation standards and guidelines of the Central Government.
In this regard, since it is not practically possible to determine the notified area at the gram panchayat level and experiment with crop harvesting, the Prime Minister Crop Insurance in Kharif Season 2019 is only at the level of Revenue Board, Revenue Board Group and Taluka.

GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: PROPEVIO-2019/ P.S. 01/11-A
A decision is being made to implement the plan. In this regard, 12 crop harvesting experiments are currently being planned at the Revenue Board and Revenue Board Group level. Accordingly, the District Collectors of the concerned districts are being empowered to plan at least 12 crop harvesting experiments at the Gram Panchayat level while the Revenue Board or the Revenue Board is planning at the block level.
The Collector should plan the crop cutting experiments for the notified crops in the notified area for crop insurance as per the prescribed method in accordance with the available resources, manpower at the local level. The average of the productivity obtained through all these crop cutting experiments should be taken into account to determine the average productivity of the notified crop in the notified crop insurance area.
As per the guidelines of the Central Government, under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, state-of-the-art technology is being used to predict the yield of crops. The Government has issued the above Reference No. 1 for the purpose of obtaining accurate and time-bound estimates of the yield obtained through crop harvesting experiments using drones, mobile phones, smart phones, etc. The project will be implemented by Maharashtra State Remote Sensing Centre (MRSAC), Nagpur and National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), Hyderabad.
With a view to obtain accurate data in a transparent manner, it has been made mandatory to use the mobile app developed by the Central Government for crop harvesting experiments under this scheme. Apart from this, no other system/ app should be used for harvesting experiments. The selection of the plot should be done using the random method or remote sensing technique prescribed for crop harvesting experiment. The location of the plot should not be disclosed until the harvest to avoid any moral hazard.
7. Insurance Coverage: Under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, farmers will get insurance cover for losses due to unavoidable reasons.
7.1.Prevented sowing/ planting/ germination due to adverse climatic conditions.
The insurance cover will be payable if the sown/ un-sown area is more than 75% of the normal area only for the notified major crops which could not be sown/ transplanted in the notified area on a large scale due to adverse conditions of inadequate rainfall, climatic conditions etc.
7.2 On Account Payment of Claims due to Mid-Season Adversity Insurance cover shall be paid in case of adverse weather conditions during the season, but not earlier than 15 days before the normal harvest, if the expected production of the farmers is expected to fall by more than 50% of the average production due to floods, rain interruptions, drought, etc.

10.3 Determination of Compensation Based on Average Yield at the End of the Season 1. The compensation to be determined under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana will be based on the average figure of income obtained from crop harvesting experiments in the insurance sector unit as determined by the Government. If the average yield per hectare of the insured crop in a given area falls below the threshold yield for that year, it is assumed that all the insured farmers in that area have suffered a loss.
The threshold yield or guaranteed yield of an insurance component shall be the average yield of the last 5 years out of the best of the previous 7 years in that season for all crops x the risk level. Under this scheme, a uniform risk level of 70 per cent has been fixed for all crops.
Threshold income= 5 years average income best among the last 7 years in season× 70% (guaranteed income)
3. Formula for determining compensation:
Average annual income- the average annual income for the year.
The amount of insurance cover (Rs. It's per. (a) the threshold income
4. If the crop harvesting experiment is not possible in the absence of area under the crop as per the number prescribed in an insurance area unit, the concerned insurance companies shall, with the consent of the State Government, take the following action.
In cases where there is not enough area under the crop, due to unfavourable climatic conditions/ infrastructure, adequate crop harvest may not be possible, the concerned insurance sector shall first assume the average income of the nearest equivalent insurance sector unit for the unit. Only if it is not possible to do so, the relevant insurance sector assumes a higher unit of income than the component. However, this provision can be used only in exceptional circumstances and at least for insurance sector entities, to avoid crop harvesting experiments.
This provision cannot be used. The district level machinery needs to ensure that adequate crop harvesting experiments are carried out in all the notified insurance area units as planned. The threshold income will not be released before the insurance claim is settled.
It will be mandatory/ necessary for the State Government/ concerned field staff to provide full opportunity to the insurance companies to co-witness the crop harvesting experiments and to provide electronic/ physical copies of the relevant photographs and charts immediately. Coordinate with the field level staff/ officials conducting crop cutting experiments and inform the Crop Insurance Company at least 7 days in advance about the schedule of crop cutting experiments to mobilize manpower accordingly.
6. Crops for control, coordination and obtaining necessary information about the crop harvesting experiment in the district.
It will be mandatory for the insurance companies to appoint one of their skilled representatives at the district level for at least three months during the harvesting season. Necessary space in the office of the District Superintendent of Agriculture and

Arrangements should be made to facilitate the exchange of information on crop harvesting experiments by providing facilities to the district administration.
10.4. Localised Disasters: Under this component, the loss of notified crop due to damage caused by localised natural calamities such as inundation of insured area, landslide, hailstorm, cloudburst or lightning, will be determined by conducting panchnama at individual level.
The risk will be applicable if the crop is damaged due to increased water level or overflowing well or flood water entering the field and the farm remains submerged for a long time.
10.5) Determination of post-withdrawal compensation.
The compensation will be given for damage caused by hailstorm, storm, cyclone or unseasonal rain at the individual level, up to a maximum of 2 weeks (14 days) from the harvest, only for the notified crops that have been harvested and spread for drying in the fields of the notified area. Under this provision, the risk will be applicable only if the unseasonal rainfall is more than 20% of the average of the long-term rainfall of that month for that district and the loss is found in the panchnama at the individual level.
The criteria for compensation under the above risk in 10.4 and 10.5 shall be as follows:
This provision will be applicable at the individual level for all farmers growing notified crops in the notified insurance area.
The maximum liability shall be equal to the sum insured against the affected crop area.
(3) The compensation shall be paid in proportion to the net cost incurred for cultivation of the crop till the occurrence of the risk under this head subject to the sum insured.
11. Action to be taken to determine the compensation for various risks covered under the scheme.
11.1 Action to be taken and Time Limit for Adverse Weather Conditions and Risks in Emergence or Pre-Sowing Conditions 1. A District Level Joint Committee is being constituted under the Chairmanship of the Collector at the District level to determine the compensation for pre-sowing/ pre-sowing risks due to the adverse weather conditions of the season.

3. In case of adverse weather conditions or after the detection of pre-sowing/ pre-sowing risks, a decision should be taken to issue a notification by keeping all the information, reports in accordance with the proxy indicators in the district level joint committee meeting within 7 days.
The survey of 5% of the total sown area of notified crops in the notified area within 7 days of the meeting of the District Level Joint Committee is required to be carried out to assess the damage. The survey is required to be conducted at 10 randomly selected locations in the insurance sector.
