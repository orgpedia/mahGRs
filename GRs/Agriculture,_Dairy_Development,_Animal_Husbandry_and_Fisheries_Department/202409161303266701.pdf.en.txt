Maharashtra ranks sixth in milk production at the national level, according to the data in the year 2022-23.
The number is required. The per capita milk consumption in the country is 459 grams per person per day.

Providing farmers with the means to produce the pair becomes routine.
In the wake of the above, 11 districts of Vidarbha and Marathwada will be covered from 2016 to 2022.
