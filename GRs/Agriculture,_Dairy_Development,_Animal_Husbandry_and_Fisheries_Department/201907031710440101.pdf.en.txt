The proposal:
The registration of ground water fisheries cooperative societies is based on the criteria laid down by the Fisheries Department in the contractual policy for pond/ reservoir fishing and the provisions of the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960 and Rules, 1961. The government has decided to implement a revised policy on the leasing of ponds/ reservoirs for fishing. Under the 97th Constitutional Amendment, the Department of Cooperation has adopted a policy for qualitative development of cooperative institutions by bringing about a paradigm shift in the functioning of cooperative institutions. In order to incorporate the above changes in the work of fisheries cooperative societies and to bring about coherence and uniformity in the policy of the Department of Fisheries and the policy of registering the Groundwater Fisheries Cooperative Society (Primary) on the water bodies and the Groundwater District Fishermen Union, all the decisions and circulars of the previous government have been adjusted together. The Government Decision dated 22/02/2019 was issued.
The fishermen have submitted representations regarding the revision of the lake lease policy regarding the formation of the groundwater fisheries cooperative society, the association of the fisheries cooperative society to be formed on the water body and the policy of the registration of the groundwater district fishermen union. So, consider all these things and give a date. It was under consideration of the Government to issue a self-explanatory all inclusive and all-encompassing revised Government Resolution concluding the Government Resolution dated 22/02/2019.
Government Decision- The Government, by this decision, based on the provisions and norms of the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act 1960, has decided to set up Groundwater Fisheries Cooperative Societies (Primary), Fishermen and various Executive Cooperative Societies on 2000 hectares of land on ponds/ water bodies for fisheries.
