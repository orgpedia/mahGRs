Preamble: To increase fish production in the state, read the revised policy on cage fish culture. 1 issued under the said Government Decision, the terms and conditions and procedures for cage fish conservation have been prescribed. Read the government's decision here. 2 It has been decided to incorporate these suggestions in the said Government Resolution in line with the amendments suggested in the proposal received from the Commissioner Fisheries Office vide letter here and accordingly, it has been decided to issue the Government Sanction Letter. The reason The policy issued under 26/08/2021 should be read in conjunction with the following points:
Government's stand:
(a) the decision of the Government, Article No. 1 of 26/08/2021. The procedure for the allocation of water area for the conservation of fish by cage method shall include the following:
1. the decision of the government. As on 17/10/2016, 1% of total water bodies in reservoirs above 200 ha. Under 09/03/2018, a policy has been formulated for cage culture in 0.5 percent of the total water bodies in reservoirs below 200 hectares.
Under this policy, the Pinjara project has been approved under various schemes for fish culture in the reservoirs of Maharashtra. The new cage project should be approved after verifying how many cages can be installed in the remaining water area excluding the water area of the approved cage projects in the useful water body. The concerned should ensure that the allocated water area is not misused while approving the cage project.

Govt. Purse No: Matsyavi-2016/ PR No.98/ Padum-13
The number of cages for all water bodies on subsidized basis will be increased to a maximum of 18 cages, 630 sq. I propose to provide a maximum of 72 cages, 2520 sq.ft., in the ratio of 6 cages per member per water body to the number of cages in case of individual fish breeder as well as fish breeder cooperative societies/ women self help groups/ fishermen self help groups/ joint midwifery groups. I am going to define the water area like this.
(3) The construction of cage shall be permissible to the eligible applicant as per the available water area from the application received for construction of cage on non-subsidized basis.
Government decisions, 2. The conditions contained in Article No. 2 of 26/08/2021 regarding the construction of the cage should be read as follows:
It will be mandatory to add 240 drums for 18 cages and 960 drums for 72 cages.
In lieu of this
Since the conditions regarding cage construction are a technical matter, the number of drums should be determined by the District Assistant Commissioner of Fisheries Business in accordance with the size of the cage and the long-term use of the cage. The government will not be responsible for the damage caused to the cage construction due to natural calamities or other reasons. No compensation can be demanded from the government.
Government decisions, iii. Art. No. 5.7 b) of 26/08/2021 regarding the signing of contract for cage fish culture should be read as follows-
The finalization of the said agreement shall be within a period of 1 month from the receipt of the agreement in the prescribed format by the Commissioner Level Cage Water Area Allocation Committee.
In lieu of this
The Assistant Commissioner of Fisheries of the concerned district shall be bound to finalize the said agreement within a period of 1 month from the receipt of the agreement in the prescribed format. In case of disagreement or dispute regarding the signing of the agreement, the Commissioner-level Pinjara Water Area Allocation Committee will have the right to take a decision in this regard.
