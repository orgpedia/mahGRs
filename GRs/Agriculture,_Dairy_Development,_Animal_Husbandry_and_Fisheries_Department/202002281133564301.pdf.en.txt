GOVERNMENT DECISION NO. MACRUPA 1018/ PR. NO. 230/6-A,
The National Pension Scheme has become operational from 01.04.2015. In the National Pension Scheme, the employees are given the equivalent contribution of the agricultural university on the deducted contribution from the salary. These contributions are made available for investment through a fund manager appointed by the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority.
In case of termination of the employee's membership of the scheme due to death, retirement, resignation, etc., the pension fund will be invested in the annuity plan as per the rules determined by the Regulatory and Development Authority and there is a provision to provide monthly pensionary benefits to the employee/ his heirs. But in case of death, the employee is given all the accumulated funds deposited in his account as no annuity plan is in operation at present.
In case of death of a member of this scheme due to short service while in service, the family of the said employee does not get any benefit other than the accumulated funds deposited in his account.
