Government Circular No: PARIKH- 2020/ PR No. 22/2-A,
In 2018-19, under the" Unnat Krishi-Samridh Kisan" campaign, the taluk-wise beneficiaries should be selected immediately in the manner of applications received from the farmers as per the procedure prescribed by the relevant government decision. Similarly, pre-approval orders should be issued to the beneficiaries immediately without waiting for the disbursement of funds under the scheme to the concerned district/ taluk.
In the year 2020-21, the old applications of the farmers whose applications could not be approved and given benefits under various schemes due to lack of funds in the year 2019-20 should be considered while releasing the applications, these farmers will not need to apply again. In this way, the new applications received in the year 2020-21 and the old applications received in the year 2019-20 should be combined and released and the beneficiaries should be selected for the year 2020-21.
Considering the rate of leakage of farmers after prior approval of their applications in the last few years, one and a half times of the total financial target received for each scheme district/ taluka wise should be pre-approved.
6. Under Fruit Plantation Scheme, farmers are provided with pits to plan the cultivation of fruits. Pre-consent orders must be issued before April 15, 2020.
Detailed guidelines for implementation of various schemes of the Department of Agriculture for the year 2019-20 have been issued by the Commissionerate of Agriculture. Therefore, all the Directors of Agriculture and the Commissioner (Agriculture) should ensure that only the changes that are required to be made in the guidelines issued in 2019-20 are communicated to the field offices without issuing fresh guidelines again in 2020-21.
