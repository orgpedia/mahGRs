Introduction: Veterinarians who have obtained a graduate veterinary education qualification are allowed to practice veterinary services after registering with the Maharashtra State Veterinary Council.
2. Many complaints are being received regarding the practice of veterinary profession in the State by bogus veterinarians who do not possess the said veterinary educational qualification. The Maharashtra State Veterinary Council takes action against bogus veterinary practitioners who do not have such a degree but pretend to have a veterinary degree.
However, the Maharashtra State Veterinary Council does not have sufficient manpower to detect and check such bogus veterinarians. Therefore, the government was considering the formation of committees at the divisional level as well as at the state level as follows to investigate the complaints received in this way and examine the necessary documents available with them and if found true, to recommend necessary legal action against them.
GOVERNMENT DECISIONS: 4. In view of the above, a committee is being constituted at the divisional level as well as at the State level to examine and make recommendations on the basis of complaints received against bogus veterinary practitioners who are practicing veterinary profession by pretending to be graduate veterinarians.
