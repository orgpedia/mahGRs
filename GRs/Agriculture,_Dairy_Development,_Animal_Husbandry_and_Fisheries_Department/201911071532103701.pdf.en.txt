the order
The implementation of Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana proposed by the Central Government has been started in the State from Kharif season 2016.

Considering the delay in the implementation of the scheme due to insufficient response from the crop insurance companies regarding the tender process published by the government under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, the ever-increasing financial liabilities of the government, the crops to be determined under the scheme, the increasing expectations of the farmers regarding the return of the scheme, the delayed payments to the farmers due to various technical reasons, etc., the government was considering the formation of a committee to suggest the changes expected in the existing format and structure of the scheme for effective implementation of the scheme.
