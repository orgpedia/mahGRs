Department of Agriculture and Padum Government Circular No: CPS-2013/ PR No. 266/1-A, dated 17.10.2013.
Government circular:
It has been observed that a large number of complaints are being received regarding the sowing of seeds by farmers at the beginning of the season in Kharif-2020. It is becoming difficult for the present taluk-level grievance redressal committee to go to the farmers' field and investigate every complaint within the prescribed time frame. Hence, the government should order an inquiry. The composition of the Taluk Level Grievance Redressal Committees constituted as on 17.10.2013 for the year 2020-21 is being revised as under:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Taluka Agriculture Officer | Chairman                                                                                      |
| 2                          | Representative of Agricultural University/ Agricultural Research Centre/ Krishi Vigyan Kendra | the members          |
| 3                          | Mahabeej Representative (as per availability)                                                 | the members          |
| 4                          | Agriculture Officer (Panchayat Samiti)/ Mandal Agriculture Officer                            | The Member Secretary |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The District Agriculture Officer should form a committee for each taluk as mentioned above.
If the number of complaints in the taluka is more than 100, the District Superintending Agriculture Officer is being empowered to form more than one committee for that taluka. More than one committee should be formed for such talukas considering the number of officers available in the district.
This will be implemented from 2020-21 onwards. The committee has to finalise the report by making field visits within a time frame of 7 days.
