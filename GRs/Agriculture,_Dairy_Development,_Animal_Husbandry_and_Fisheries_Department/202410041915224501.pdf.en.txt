The Proposal: -
India is the world's second-largest producer of vegetables after China. taken to the world
Vegetable production in India accounts for 15% of total vegetable production. Pick
Less production time, more production, more available food
The nutritional value and the potential to provide employment in the agricultural sector and in the out-of-farm sector.
Vegetables are considered an important component of agricultural production.
Vegetable production in India grew exponentially in the last two decades. Sun 2000-01 that
Vegetable production during this period ranged from 93.85 million tonnes to 196.26 million tonnes.
There has been a significant increase.
Low productivity, changes in climate and the resulting diseases and pest problems,
Higher production costs and lower sustainability, lack of variety, changing environment
Lack of adaptive technology, improper use of available natural resource materials, low quality
Challenges such as vegetable production and food security issues should be addressed by the agriculture sector.
It's taking.
According to the Indian Council of Medical Research, 300 grams of vegetables per person per day
It is necessary to take in the diet, but in reality this much vegetable per person is not available in our country.
Vegetables produced due to inadequate facilities for improper harvesting, handling and retention of vegetables.
