Introduction: The Government of Maharashtra has been making efforts to create eco-friendly livelihoods in the marine fisheries sector as per the Blue Revolution Policy. Crab, nettle, canal, mussels and cucumber farming, cage fish farming in the open sea, shrimp conservation in salt water etc. are being taken up. In Sindhudurg district, the programme of rearing crab and canal by community and self-help groups under the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) project has been a spectacular success. Therefore, the government has decided to expand the coverage of these programmes in all the coastal districts of the state- Sindhudurg, Ratnagiri, Raigad, Thane and Palghar.
Marine fisheries produced in the state of Maharashtra are of a general multi-species nature. These multi-species include specific and adaptive species of marine species that are complementary to the shoreline and its environment, e.g. It is necessary to preserve the species of crab, seabass, oyster, and mussels. At present, the state's crab seed requirement is met by the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Aquaculture (RGCA), Chennai, the only institute in the country. Since the availability of this seed has to be done from a very long distance so that it is not possible to conserve the people of this species extensively, efforts have been initiated to speed up the government's efforts to provide livelihood to the coastal people of the state.

Setting up of seed production centre of these varieties is very essential for successful generation of additional income and livelihood for the fishing dependent communities in the coastal areas of Maharashtra. The lack of such a seed center in western India is a big problem. The proposed Seed Centre, if set up, will generate livelihood for thousands of fishermen and other fishing dependents in the seven coastal districts of the State and will be of immense economic benefit to them.
Ubhand (Maharashtra). Rs. A sum of Rs. 03.00 crore will be available and the remaining funds will be raised through National Fisheries Development Board and State Government's Chanda to Banda Scheme.
