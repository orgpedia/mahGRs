circular
The court cases of the officers/ employees on the establishment of the Commissioner, Dairy Development Department are filed in the court in large numbers. It is observed that in most of the cases, after the adjudication, a belated proposal is submitted for filing an appeal. Many of the proposals submitted to the government are not complete. It takes a long time to correct errors. As a result, the prescribed time limit for appeals expires and subsequent appeals are dismissed on the ground of delay. As a result, the government has to bear the financial burden. In the meantime, the court's decision, which set a specific time limit for the proceedings, faces contempt petitions without proper proceedings. In this way, the following instructions are being given to avoid administrative delays and delays and take timely action.
Monthly review of the total number of court cases pending in the offices under the Dairy Development Department. In cases where urgent action is required to be taken, necessary action should be taken immediately within the prescribed time limit.
Legal Cell should be set up under the chairmanship of Assistant Commissioner (Administration), Commissioner, Dairy Development Office to streamline the handling of judicial matters. Through this cell, all the judicial cases should be recorded and directed to the concerned authorities regarding the action to be taken and the cases should be submitted to the regular commissioner (Dairy Development) every fifteen days.
(3) The certified copy of the court order should be obtained immediately as per the provisions of the Rules of Business of the Department of Law and Justice, 1984. The proposal should be submitted to the government with self-explanatory comments within 15 days, along with the comments of the public prosecutor, after obtaining the opinion of the public prosecutor as required.
