Regarding the implementation of the" Sell to Pickle" campaign in the state through the Agriculture and Allied Department based on the concept of Hon'ble Chief Minister.
The Government of Maharashtra
Department of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, Dairy Development and Fisheries
Government Resolution No.Sankiran-2020/ P.S. 138/3 A
Madam Cama Marg, Hutatma Rajguru Chowk,
Ministry of Health, Mumbai- 32
Date: 27th of October 2020
The proposal-
Agriculture is the mainstay of the state's economy. Although the share of agriculture in the gross national income is declining, the proportion of population dependent on agriculture at the national and state level is 69.55 per cent respectively. The share of small and marginal farmers in the state is 81 per cent. With about 83 per cent of the dryland area, the economic income of the state farmers is directly affected by global climate change and fluctuations in their international selling price as most of the major crops are linked to the global market.
In this era of globalization, the whole world has become a village, in which we have to find a local market to sell the farm produce, which is in demand in the global market and create a strategic framework to reorient the cropping system and farming system by adopting the strategy of' sell to ripen', from which the farmers can get more income. The Chief Minister is the concept of the state of Maharashtra. For this, it was under the consideration of the government that more planned efforts should be made by the agriculture and agriculture allied departments to take advantage of the opportunities in the domestic and global market directly to the farmers based on market-oriented agricultural development by making proper use of the strengths in the agricultural sector and the social capital and infrastructure being created in the state. The following decisions are being taken:
Government's decision
1. It is necessary to find out what the producers and consumers of agricultural products want and develop crop methods, agricultural processes, supply chains and marketing systems accordingly. For this, the campaign will help the farmers to sell their produce. Investments will be made through the respective schemes of various departments of the government to develop the necessary training, technical support, infrastructure and risk mitigation capabilities to enable productive farmers to access new and organized markets through processing industries, retail sales chains and agri-based entrepreneurs. For this, the Department of Agriculture will help in setting up crop-wise various value chain projects.

2. Objectives of' Sell to Pickle" Campaign
1) To focus on the cultivation of crops that are in demand in the market.
2) To produce better and better quality of food.
(3) The development of agriculture.
4) Developing a brand for the sale of agricultural products.
5) To provide increased market opportunities through value chain development projects.
6) Making policy changes for ease of doing business in agriculture.
Increase investment in agriculture.
8) Ensure sustainability of farm income and increase net income 9) Analyse market information and communicate it to the producers.
3. It will not be possible to immediately build or process large projects at all locations while working on the mission of" Sell to Pick." However, it is somewhat easier to connect the farmers with the consumers directly without the prevailing marketing system.
Apart from this, efforts can be made to increase the conscious cultivation of some crops according to the demand of the consumers, branding of geo-rated crops and ensuring fair prices for those crops. These include the crops which are currently being grown by farmers and are directly of consumer use without processing and those which are not being used without processing.
The farmers need to be guided to reduce the existing chain steps while delivering their produce to the consumers, minimum standards required for marketing techniques, counterfeiting, cleaning and drying, etc. which are low cost but make a huge difference in the price.

Availability and planning of funds
For the implementation of the' Sell to Pick" campaign, various schemes of the agriculture and allied departments as well as the departments of cooperation, marketing, NABARD etc. should be integrated. Firstly, facilities should be provided to the farmers groups under various schemes to sell their produce directly to the consumers. Processors/ Exporters/ Co-operative Warehouses/ Housing Societies should be roped in for sale of goods of these groups.
These groups will be selected and converted into Farmer Producer Companies (FPOs) for which priority subsidy will be provided under the schemes of Integrated Horticulture Development Mission, Nanaji Deshmukh Krishi Sanjeevani Project, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Udyog Unnayan Yojana (PMFME). In addition, 10000 Farmer Producer Companies will be set up to take advantage of the scheme. In addition, through well-organized groups/ companies. Value chains can be developed under the Balasaheb Thackeray Agribusiness and Rural Transformation (SMART) project. For this, the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF) scheme can be availed to get the necessary financial support. The benefit of the above schemes will be given to the groups on priority. For this, 40 to 50 per cent of the budget will be allocated.
6. A Supervisory State Level Committee is being set up for guidance, project approval and monitoring of interventions and impact of Agriculture and allied departments for implementation of" Sell to Pick" campaign.
