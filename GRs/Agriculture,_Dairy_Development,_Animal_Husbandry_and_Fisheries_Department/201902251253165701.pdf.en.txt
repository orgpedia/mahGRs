Government Resolution No.- Paviya-1017/ PR No. 87/ Padum-3
Madam Cama Marg, Hutatma Rajguru Chowk,
Ministry, Mumbai- 400 032.
Date: February 25, 2019
The proposal: The Minister (Finance) had announced the launch of a new scheme" Establishment of 349 Mobile Veterinary Clinics in the State to provide Animal Health Services at the doorsteps of the livestock rearers" in the Budget Session 2017.
2. Veterinary services like artificial insemination, drug therapy, vaccination, surgery, infertility check-up, pregnancy check-up, etc. are regularly provided to the livestock in the state through the Veterinary Institute. However, if the animal falls sick, the animal has to be taken to the nearest veterinary clinics. If the animal patient is not able to walk then the animal keepers have to arrange for the vehicle at their own cost. Most of the farmers are not able to bear the financial burden. As a result, the animals die due to lack of medical care. To increase the production capacity of livestock in the state, it is necessary to have good health and to provide best quality veterinary services. Therefore, in the remote, hilly, tribal dominated areas of the state and in the areas where the number of veterinary clinics is less compared to livestock, as well as in the areas where there are inadequate communication facilities, it is necessary to establish a mobile veterinary team to deliver veterinary services to the doorsteps of the livestock farmers.
Considering the above, the Cabinet in its meeting held on 12th February, 2019 has approved the establishment of 80 new Mobile Veterinary Teams in 80 Taluks in the first phase out of the 349 Rural Taluks to be set up in the State and taking into consideration the results of the comprehensive study of the functioning of these Mobile Veterinary Teams, it has been decided to form Mobile Veterinary Teams in the remaining Taluks in the next phase.
In view of the above, the Government was contemplating to set up 80 mobile veterinary teams in the State in the first phase to provide veterinary services to the animal patients at the doorsteps of the livestock rearers.
