Preamble- There is not a single shrimp seed production centre functioning in the state to supply the required seeds for shrimp conservation in saline water. The current products are based on shrimp seeds that are naturally available in salt water. At present, the entire import of the shrimp seed is being done from Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. Most of the shrimp conservationists in the state are small land holding farmers (0.5 to 2 hectares) who find the process cumbersome and costly, thus hampering the development of the land and leaving a large area devoid of shrimp development due to lack of shrimp seeding.
At present, rearing shrimp by importing shrimp seeds from other states is not economically viable. Therefore, it is necessary to increase the area under shrimp conservation by increasing the area under shrimp conservation and increasing the production. There is a huge demand for turmeric in the international market. Agricultural land is considered to be fertile. However, fish farming can produce a large amount of protein-rich food. Foreign currency can be obtained. It will also create job opportunities by developing the coastal areas. For successful and large scale growth of prawns, scientific techniques of conservation and quality seeds are required. In line with the above announcement made by the Hon'ble Minister (Finance), it is proposed to set up prawn seed production centres on the lines of' Nilkranti" scheme to be implemented with the financial assistance of the Central Government by encouraging private farmers to meet the local prawn seed requirement. for the approval of the Cabinet.
The meeting was held on 08.03.2018. The proposal of the Department. As per the approval of the Cabinet, approval was under consideration for setting up of 2 large shrimp seed production centres (1 each for Thane, Palghar and Raigad districts with 20 crore post larval capacity and 2 shrimp seed production centres, 1 each for Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg districts) and 5 mini shrimp seed production centres (5 shrimp seed production centres with 50 lakh post larval capacity, 1 each for Thane, Palghar, Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg districts).
