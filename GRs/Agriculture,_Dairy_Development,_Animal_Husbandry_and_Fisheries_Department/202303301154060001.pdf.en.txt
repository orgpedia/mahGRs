For this, village-wise groups of farmers should be formed, the farmers of these groups should be provided with crop production technology through crop demonstrations, agricultural schools, field visits and training, their capacity building should be done and an action plan should be prepared for the promotion of crop production technology. Also, farmer groups should be formed in consultation with the Village Agriculture Development Committee of the village in the respective taluks and such farmer groups should be formed a Farmer Producer Company or should be affiliated to an existing farmer producer company, post-harvest handling, retrieval, branding and marketing of the produce to get the right price for the farmers' goods should be achieved by the farmers' groups as well as the farmer producer companies. For this, financial assistance will be provided to these farmer groups to build infrastructure. The focus will be on storage, cleaning and recycling of goods and capacity building of farmers through manufacturing companies to connect them directly with buyers, processors and exporters as well as commodity markets.
