Read: 1. Crop Competition Manual, January 2002 2. Letter from the Commissioner of Agriculture No./ Worms/ V.P. 4/ Crop Competition/ 12089/2020, d. 16/04/2020
Introduction: In order to increase the productivity of the crop in the state, various experiments are done by the farmers in different areas and productivity is increased. If such experimental farmers are encouraged and honored for their productivity, their willpower and morale will increase.
New technologies will be used. This will help in increasing the income of farmers. The scheme is being implemented in the state with the aim that other farmers of the area will be guided and the total production of the state will be increased significantly.
At present, in this scheme, the farmer has to take the same crop for three consecutive years in his field to get the highest award at the state level, maintain consistency in productivity, unfortunately, the reduction in productivity in the event of untimely emergency/ natural disaster-like situation plagues the farmers. In order to avoid these issues altogether, the earlier system is being changed to enable the farmers to participate and compete on the productivity of the crop in a single year. The competition will now be held in a single year instead of three phases. The government has decided to give the awards at the state, division, district and taluka levels based on the productivity of the farmers.
After considering the proposal submitted by the Agriculture Commissionerate in this regard, the matter regarding the restructuring of the committees, eligibility criteria, various forms, the number of crop competition winners, the format, the increase in prize money, prescribing the schedule for the crop competition, and the need to change the criteria for the crop competition at different levels in accordance with the time, the government decided to revise the criteria for the crop competition from the 2020-21 rabi season.
