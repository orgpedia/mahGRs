In the Konkan region of the state, Sindhudurg and Ratnagiri districts produce a large amount of cashew. Paddy is the main source of livelihood for farmers here. The district also has a large number of industries that process cashew crops.
However, the farmers face many problems from the cultivation of this fruit to the pests that fall on it from time to time, as well as the processing and sale. As a result, all these factors affect the production of cashews. Therefore, considering the difficulties faced by the farmers from the cultivation to the processing and sale of the cashew fruit, the government was considering the formation of a committee to advise the government to formulate a definite policy for the overall development of the cashew fruit. Accordingly, the following decisions were taken:
Government Decision: Considering the difficulties faced by the farmers from the cultivation to processing and sale of the cashew fruit, a definite policy should be formulated for the overall development of the cashew fruit. The Committee is being constituted under the Chairmanship of Minister of State for Home (Rural), Finance and Planning.
