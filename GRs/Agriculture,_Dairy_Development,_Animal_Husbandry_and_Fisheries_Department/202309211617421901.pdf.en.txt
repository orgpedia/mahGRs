As a result, 80% of small and marginal farmers in the state were ineligible to get subsidy for cultivating orchards under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme because they did not have job cards. In this backdrop, the State Government has decided to implement the" Bhausaheb Phundkar Fruit Garden Plantation Scheme" from the Kharif season 2018-19 for the farmers who are not eligible to cultivate fruit orchards under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. The approval has been accorded vide Government Resolution dated 06.07.2018.

Following this, the government took decision on:
