Due to the unbalanced use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, fungicides and weedicides for the production of more food grains and hybrids and other crops, excessive use of water, soil erosion, less or no use of organic fertilizers, frequent use of the same crop, etc. the soil is becoming dead and hard due to the destruction of the organic elements in the soil. As a result, land degradation, soil degradation, agricultural productivity, agricultural productivity, and the cost of production increase. As a result, the health of humans and animals is adversely affected, threatening the environment as well as biodiversity.
There is an increase in the demand for high-quality healthy and toxin-free fruits, vegetables and cereals to increase the immunity of the human body.
