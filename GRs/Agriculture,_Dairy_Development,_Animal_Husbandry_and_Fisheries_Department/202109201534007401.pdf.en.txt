Reference: 1. Department of Agriculture and Padum Government Resolution No. 48/4-O, D. 05/10/2020 2. Letter from the Commissioner of Agriculture No.4/ Crop Competition/ Demand for Fund/ 24829/2021, D. 03/08/2021
Introduction: In order to increase the productivity of the crop in the state, various experiments are done by the farmers in different areas and productivity is increased. If the productivity of such experimental farmers is encouraged and honored, then their willpower, morale will increase and new advanced technologies will be used with more enthusiasm. This will help in increasing the income of farmers. The scheme is being implemented in the state with the aim that other farmers of the area will be guided and the total production of the state will be increased significantly.
At present, in this scheme, the farmer has to take the same crop for three consecutive years in his field to get the highest award at the state level, maintain consistency in productivity, unfortunately, the reduction in productivity in the event of untimely emergency/ natural disaster-like situation plagues the farmers. In order to avoid these issues, the government has decided to give prizes at the state, division, district and taluka level based on the productivity of the farmers.
In line with the revised guidelines from Rabi season 2020-21, Crop Competitions were conducted for 6 crops namely Rabi Sorghum, Wheat, Gram, Barley, Sesame and Black Gram for general and tribal groups. However, there were no competitions for 2 crops namely Jowar and Sesame due to less number of competitors. A total of 6053 farmers from the state participated in the competition for the remaining four crops of Rabi sorghum, wheat, gram and karadai. Accordingly, the results of the Rabi season 2020-21 for general and tribal groups were announced. The result was declared by the State Level Pick Competition Committee on 24/06/2021.
The first, second and third prize winners were selected on the basis of their performance in the state level competition.
The first, second and third prize winners will be selected from the respective district-level competitions.
