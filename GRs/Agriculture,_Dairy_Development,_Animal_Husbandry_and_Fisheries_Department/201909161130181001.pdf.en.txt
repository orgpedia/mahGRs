The Central Government has issued revised guidelines for the Sub-Mission on Agricultural Mechanization for the year 2018-19. The guidelines do not include rotavator in equipment running on tractor/ power tiller (below 20 BHP) for subsidy. Tractor wheels from 20 to 35 BHP are equipped with rotavators of 5 feet and above.
The farmers of the state have been given subsidy for the purchase of tractors/ power tillers under 20 BHP under agricultural mechanization in the past and are being given subsidy at present as well. The tractor/ power tiller requires a rotavator below 5 feet in the power running equipment. There was a huge demand for rotavators less than 5 feet wide from the farmers. Considering all these factors, as per the guidelines of Sub-Mission on Agricultural Mechanization, 2016-17 of the Central Government, 20 BHP has been provided for the following tractor/ power tiller type rotavator (less than 5 feet width) within the permissible subsidy limit. The proposal to provide subsidy from the State Sponsored Agriculture Mechanization Scheme, which was administratively approved under the Government Decision of 12th September, 2019, was under consideration of the Government. As a result, the following decisions were made:
Government Decision: 1. Under the State Sponsored Scheme of Agricultural Mechanization, subsidy is being sanctioned for rotavators (less than 5 feet in width) running on Tractors/ Power Tillers (less than 20BHP).
2. The subsidy limit for the said rotavator is as follows:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| The name of the devices                                                           | Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Small and Marginal Farmers and Women Beneficiaries | Other farmers.                 |
| The maximum limit of the grant                                                    | the amount of the grant                                                                | The maximum limit of the grant | Methods of subsidy |
| Tractor/ Power Tiller (less than 20BHP) Running Rotavator (less than 5 feet wide) | Rs 0.35 lakh                                                                           | 50%                            | Rs 0.28 lakh       | 40% |
