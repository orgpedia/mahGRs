Preamble: As per the directions given under the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Funding of Poultry Farming Areas in the State vide letter dated 30/6/2005, under the Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India, the State Government has been entrusted with the entire responsibility of ensuring effective utilization of the capital contributed by the Central Government and reimbursement of the same for its utilization on a recurring basis. Therefore, in order to make effective use of this working capital, the government has approved the opening of self-financing accounts for five centers in the state- Central Egg Harvesting Center, Pune, Kolhapur, Aurangabad, Nagpur and Duck Breeding Center, Vadsa, District Gadchiroli.
Out of these, the Central Egg Upliftment Center, Kolhapur and Aurangabad are currently closed, according to the Office of the Commissioner Animal Husbandry. The Accountant General's Office has been repeatedly intimating about depositing the unaccounted funds in the personal deposit accounts/ personal provident accounts, which have been closed for more than one year, in the accounts of the Government. Therefore, it is necessary to review/ reconcile at the level of the Commissioner Animal Husbandry whether the unutilized funds from the closed self-registration account under the Commissioner Animal Husbandry Office have been deposited in the government account or how, and how many self-registration accounts are in operation at present, and whether these self-registration accounts need to be continued or not. A committee had been formed for this.
GOVERNMENT DECISION: A Committee under the Chairmanship of Deputy Commissioner (Livestock and Poultry) is being constituted for the overall functioning and coordination of the Department of Animal Husbandry under the Commissioner of Animal Husbandry. :

(2) The Committee constituted as aforesaid shall review the self-registration accounts and ascertain as to how many self-registration accounts are actually required by the Office of the Commissioner Animal Husbandry at present. Since the funds are given as playing capital in the self-financing account running as per the instructions of the Central Government, it is necessary to keep the necessary funds in the balance. Therefore, the funds spent from the self-financing account should be recouped first and only then other expenses should be made from the budgetary provision received. The unaccounted money in the closed private provident account should be deposited in the government account and the same should be reported to the Accountant General's office. The committee will also have to submit its report to the government every three months.
