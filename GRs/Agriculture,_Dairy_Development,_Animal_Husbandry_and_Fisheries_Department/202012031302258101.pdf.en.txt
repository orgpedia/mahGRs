The details of whether the fishing license has been cancelled or not should be submitted to the office of the Commissioner (Fisheries) by the Assistant Commissioner of Fisheries of all the concerned marine districts.
The Assistant Commissioner of Fisheries of all the marine districts should propose action to the concerned Designated Officer regarding maximum punishment as per Section 17 (1) (a) (b) (c) and Section 17 (3) (a) (b) of the Maharashtra Marine Fishing Regulation Act, 1981, on priority against the Persisin fishing boats fishing with the help of LED lights.
