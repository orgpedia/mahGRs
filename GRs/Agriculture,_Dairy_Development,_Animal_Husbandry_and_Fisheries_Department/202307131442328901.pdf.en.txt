The Proposal:
According to the report submitted by the Director (Horticulture) through a reference letter, the proposed Taluk Seed Multiplication Centre, Kalambu Ta. The climate of Shahada, Nandurbar district is very conducive for the cultivation of mango, guava, citrus and lemon crops. During the kharif season, crops like jowar, bajra, tur, moong and urad are grown in the taluk. In this situation, the farmers here earn their livelihood by plucking the fruits of citrus fruits available naturally in the hilly areas and selling them on the roads.
After the month of March in the season of mangoes, the work of preparing mangoes from sugarcane is seen on a large scale.
2. Farmers get good employment or economic returns from citrus fruits and mangoes. Hence, the demand for mango, papaya, guava and mango is high among farmers. But due to non-availability of stems/ saplings as per demand, some farmers prepare and plant saplings at home. But the production/ income from it is very less as compared to the recommended one. Banana and papaya are also grown in Shahada, Taloda and Nandurbar taluks. But at present, due to low market price and inadequate marketing facilities, farmers are showing inclination towards cultivation of mango, lemon, guava and citrus fruits in this area. In such a situation, it is necessary to provide disease-free and quality improved stems/ plants of fruit crops like mango, guava, chikoo, citrus fruits to the farmers. In view of the urgency to partially convert it into a nursery, the Taluk Seed Multiplication Centre, Kalambu Ta. The matter of approving the conversion of Shahada, G.
