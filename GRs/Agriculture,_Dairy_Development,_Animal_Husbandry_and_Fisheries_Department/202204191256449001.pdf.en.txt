Approximately 76% of the total number of goats in the state are non-native breeds.

In the goat rearing business, there is a lack of livestock, directionless breeding of goats, lack of breeders for breeding, ignorance of improved methods of business of goat farmers, poor economic condition of goat farmers, non-purchase of goats on weight, non-sale of goats.
