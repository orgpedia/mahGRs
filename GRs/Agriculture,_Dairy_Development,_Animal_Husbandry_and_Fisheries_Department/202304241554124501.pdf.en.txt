2) Government Decisions, Planning Department (Rohyo Division), No. Mgraro-2022/ Q. No.174/ Rohyo-6A dated 14th December, 2022.
Introduction: Under the decision of the government here, the Planning Department has implemented the Convergence of Schemes of MGNREGA and various departments through the Convergence of Families Mission and the Sarvagya Gram Samriddhi Yojana.
In the Multidimensional Poverty Index published by NITI Aayog in 2021, one-third weightage has been given to each of the disadvantages related to health, education and living standards. The government must have at least a goal to bring every citizen of the country out of deprivation. The next objective will be to make every family well-off and prosperous so that every citizen of the country can lead a happy, contented and prosperous life. India has the largest number of cattle in the world. Livestock is called wealth in the country as well as in the state. However, in many places, regular production from these animals is not expected.
4. While every household in the State is being provided facilities, it has to be enabled to utilize every resource available to them.
In order to increase the usefulness of livestock, the following factors need to be taken into account: (1) Adequate utilization of fodder obtained through livestock to maintain the declining quality of soil in the State.
(2) Conversion of indigenous cows from hybrids to cows that give more milk.
(iii) Encouraging rearing of captive goats/ sheep (iv) Utilizing available fodder.
(5) To increase the usefulness of fallow land by developing pastures.

Government Resolution No: PAVIYA-1022/ PR No.349/ PADUM-3 (6) To increase the use of land in areas with low rainfall through pasture development.
(7) To make available to the landowners a small area of land and enrich them by building huts in it.
(8) To increase the green cover in the State by promoting pasture farming.
(9) Reduce the amount of burning of farm waste through the use of available fodder.
(10) To improve the quality of soil of the State by increasing the availability of organic kerb in the society through Vermi Compost/ NADEP (11) through the use of Angry Waste and Cow dung/ dung/ urine.
(1) To increase the income of the poor in rural areas by promoting integrated management in poultry farming.
(ii) To increase the income of the rural poor by encouraging the business of outsourcing of poultry.
(iii) Enrichment of rural households by promoting linkages between poultry and fisheries.
6. Increase the income of the people by providing training on economic use of all the livestock available with the family like milk, excreta, urine, meat and waste of fodder. In this way, by increasing the confidence of the people in economic efficiency, 100% captive animal husbandry should be established in the state and the loss of crops from domestic animals should be reduced to zero. Achieving some of these goals will take time. In some cases, you can get good results in a short time.
However, in the future, the Department of Animal Husbandry will work towards achieving all these goals. Most of these schemes have been implemented to meet the targets.
The salient features, achievements of each of the schemes so far, the need to work under each scheme and the actual and potential difficulties faced in this regard are given below: (a) Schemes currently being implemented by the Department of Animal Husbandry: (i) Distribution of milch animals under innovative schemes to promote milk production in the State.
(2) Allotment of 10+1 groups of goats/ sheep for rearing of goats/ sheep in a stationary manner.
(iii) Poultry farming business through the rearing of 1000 fleshy poultry birds.
(b) Successes achieved through the schemes in operation: (i) Many BPL beneficiaries have got sustainable sources of income.

(ii) Income from animal husbandry helps in raising the economic status of farmers.
(3) It is also helping to improve the living standards of the beneficiaries.
Difficulties in implementation of the scheme: (1) The above milch cows/ buffaloes/ sheep/ goats are not being reared in captive/ stationary manner by the beneficiaries allotted to them.
(2) The animal is released into the forest for grazing. As a result, the animals do not get nutritious food.
As a result, the dairy animals do not give milk in the right quantity. Milk is small. Also, milk does not contain enough fat. Hence, they are not getting the right price.
(iii) Goats/ sheep do not get nutritious food and do not gain weight properly due to straying for fodder, which leads to the spread of germs. Farmers are not getting proper price for their produce.
(iv) Mostly, the beneficiaries are illiterate and do not know the importance of captive rearing.
(v) The cattle rearers do not have proper knowledge of the market and are forced to sell their cattle in the nearby market, causing financial loss to them.
MGNREGA and Animal Husbandry Department will carry out convergence of schemes at the following 5 levels.
(1) To achieve the objective, the action of the Department of Animal Husbandry and the funds of MNREGA.
(2) Pasture development through MGNREGA and Gotha under MGNREGA can be called a combination.
(3) In order to generate income from the funds raised under MGNREGA, the Department should link its schemes to it. For example: under MNREGA, pasture and cow sheds and under the scheme of Animal Husbandry Department, distribution of goats, sheep, milch cows/ buffaloes in groups/ training/ vaccination/ animal health, pest control, castration, sterilization etc.
(4) Convergence from the pooling of funds of the Department of Animal Husbandry and MNREGA, especially to maintain the ratio of 60:40.
(5) Convergence of services of officers and employees of MNREGA and Animal Husbandry Department,
9. Sometimes, while carrying out works in the field of Animal Husbandry, it may be difficult to fit all the works in the ratio of unskilled and skilled in 60:40, in such a situation, other works can be included in the planning. However, works not related to the Animal Husbandry Department will be implemented through the Panchayat system.

The department should revise these earlier trainings for the purpose of universalization of animal husbandry.
Also, if this prior training is face to face, it is likely to have time and funding constraints. Design online training, video-based training, hybrid training, video-only training, training that answers questions from the workbook, etc., so that manpower and funding constraints do not adversely affect the work.
Similarly, a WhatsApp group of people involved in animal husbandry should be created in a taluka/ hospital area. People will face problems. A solution will be found. A doctor can also guide you. But the farmers should learn from each other rather than being guided by doctors.
