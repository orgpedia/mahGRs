In order to increase the availability of fodder to livestock during the drought situation in the State, in 2018-19, various varieties of fodder seeds and fertilizers are being supplied to the targeted beneficiaries at 100% subsidy for cultivation of fodder crops under Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana. A total of Rs. A sum of Rs. 35.00 crore has been sanctioned. Apart from this, schemes for the development of fodder are being implemented under the District Annual Plan and National Livestock Mission.
A balanced diet should consist of whole grains, vegetables and fruits. The Department of Animal Husbandry is expected to produce about 61.31 LMT of green fodder from the various schemes being implemented to provide fodder to the livestock during the drought situation in the State. By adding value to green fodder, the method of preparing millets is prevalent for better nutrition of livestock.
