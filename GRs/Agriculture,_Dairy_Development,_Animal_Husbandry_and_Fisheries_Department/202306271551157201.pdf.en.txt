Government Decision: A meeting was held with the representatives of milk producers cooperatives and private milk unions, animal feed companies and farmers' organizations on the issue of milk price in the state. on 22.6.2023. The meeting was held under the chairmanship of the Minister (Animal Husbandry and Dairying Development). During the meeting, representatives of milk producers' associations pointed out that there has been a huge fall in the price of milk and this has caused dissatisfaction among the milk producing farmers.
Milk collection in the state is mainly done by private and cooperative milk unions. Farmers get better price for milk as production is less. However, due to the increase in milk production during the milking season, the milk of farmers is accepted at a lower rate by various private and cooperative milk unions. This causes huge loss to the farmers.
In view of all the above, the following committee is being constituted to fix the prices of milk so that the farmers get the minimum price of milk, taking into account the operating cost of the private/ cooperative milk unions as well as the production cost of the milk producing farmers.
