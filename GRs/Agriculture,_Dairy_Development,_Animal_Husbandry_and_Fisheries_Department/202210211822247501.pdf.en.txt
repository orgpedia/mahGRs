This subsidy is given for certified and foundation seeds. In such cases, the difference amount is given to the farmers of Maharashtra State Seeds Corporation Limited (Mahabeej), Akola and National Seeds Corporation, Pune as incentive subsidy. Considering the amount due to the seed producing farmers, Maharashtra State Seeds Corporation Limited (MAHABIZ), Akola and National Seeds Corporation, Pune submit proposals to the Commissionerate of Agriculture, Maharashtra State, Pune. After examining the proposal, the appropriate proposal is submitted to the Agriculture Department through the Agriculture Commissionerate. Examine the proposal.
