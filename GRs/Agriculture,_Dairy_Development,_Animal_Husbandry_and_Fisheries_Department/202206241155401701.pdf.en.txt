Preamble: The Co-operative Societies in the Animal Husbandry/ Fisheries/ Dairying sector are audited by the Audit Board functioning under the Commissioner, Dairy Development.
However, as per the provisions of Rule 49 and 81 of the Maharashtra State Cooperative Societies Act, 1960, the qualification held by a recognised auditor is allowed to be carried out by other auditors or by the auditing agency.
On perusal of the proposals received from the interested cooperatives in respect of the schemes being implemented by the Government, it has been observed that the audit of these cooperatives is not being done/ has not been done as envisaged. In such a situation, the possibility of selection of ineligible beneficiaries as per the audit report received cannot be ruled out. To avoid this, the government was considering to get such cooperative societies (Dairy, Animal Husbandry and Fisheries Department) audited by the Audit Board under the Commissioner, Dairying.
In this regard, the Department of Cooperation has given the following feedback:" The audit of the Government Financial Aid institutions for at least 5 consecutive years is required to be done by the Government Auditors under the Audit Board (Padum), Maharashtra State, Mumbai. Because it is necessary to conduct audit by the government auditors under the Board of Audit (Padum), Maharashtra State, Mumbai for at least 5 consecutive years to check whether the government funded institutions have achieved the development of the institution and the members of the institution in accordance with the use of government funding approved and distributed properly. If such an audit is done only once in 5 years, then it will not be possible to check 100% whether the organization and the members of the organization have been developed according to the purpose of the government grant. Therefore, it is envisaged to make it mandatory for the Government financial institutions to be audited by the Government Auditors under the Audit Board (Padum), Maharashtra State, Mumbai for at least 5 consecutive years. " Considering the above feedback of the Cooperation Department, it will be mandatory for the cooperatives of the Dairy, Animal Husbandry and Fisheries Department who want to take advantage of the government schemes and the cooperatives who have taken advantage of the government scheme, to audit the audit board working under the Commissioner, Dairy Development for at least the next 5 years.
