Government Circular, Department of Higher and Technical Education, No.EBC 2018/ PR No. 38/ TANSI-4, dated 14.02.2018
Circular: Under the Rajarshi Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj Tuition Fee Scholarship Scheme, 50 percent of the tuition fee is reimbursed by the government to eligible students from economically weaker sections who take admission in various recognized courses under all agricultural universities in the state under the Department of Agriculture through centralized admission method/ prescribed method. From the academic year 2018-19 onwards, the reimbursement of 50% of the tuition fee will be credited directly to the bank accounts of eligible students.
Most of the educational institutions in the state insist on paying 100 per cent tuition fee at the time of admission while admitting students from economically weaker sections. The government has been receiving repeated complaints from students, parents, various organisations and public representatives that students are not being admitted without paying 100 per cent tuition fee. At the time of actual admission, such students are expected to take only 50 per cent of the amount credited to them by the educational institutions. The remaining 50 per cent of the scholarship amount will be transferred directly to the bank accounts of the students. Accordingly, it is hereby informed that all the concerned educational institutions while admitting students from economically weaker sections should not insist that the eligible students pay 100% of the tuition fee or the full amount at the time of admission. Students belonging to economically weaker sections who are entitled to 100% reimbursement of tuition fees should not be forced to pay tuition fees at the time of admission. Also, students who are eligible for 50 per cent reimbursement of tuition fee are allowed to be admitted if they pay 50 per cent of the tuition fee at the time of admission. In this manner, strict instructions are being issued that if the educational institutions insist or demand that the eligible students from the economically weaker sections pay the full amount of tuition fees at the time of admission, action will be taken against such institutions. This should be brought to the notice of all the agricultural universities in the state and all the educational institutions under their control. If any such complaint is received, action will be taken against the concerned authorities.
The circular should be published by the respective universities through all the media. The circular should also be published on the university's website.
