Reference: 1) Letter No. 1-15/2022-RKVY/ 1, DT. December 12, 2022 2) Department of Agriculture and Padum letter No. RKV-2022/ CR. 227/14-A, DT. 06 January, 2023 3) Letter from the Commissioner of Agriculture No.KrA/ V.P.2/ R.KrVO/ M.M.M. Mission-P.A.R.A./ 3219/2023, d. January 27, 2023 4) of the State Level Project Sanctioning Committee (SLSC) under the National Agriculture Development Scheme. Meeting to be held on 11th January, 2023. The date is January 30, 2023.
The proposal: At the initiative of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, the United Nations has declared the year 2023 as the" International Year of Millets." These foods are very important because of their nutritional value. Therefore, these cereals have been considered as nutritious cereals. These crops also have the potential to control the increasing lifestyle diseases in the society due to increasing urbanization.
The area and production of nutritious cereal crops in the state is a matter of concern. To increase the production of these crops in the state and to increase their use in food, it is necessary to promote and publicize.
Accordingly, the" Maharashtra Nutri Cereal Mission" will be implemented in a total of 34 districts of the state over a period of two years from 2022-23 and 2023-24 under the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana. The area under nutritious cereals is more, but in the districts with more production than the state average, the crop production is more and the area under cultivation is less. Therefore, it is necessary to increase the districts with less productivity than the state average and those districts where there is no area.
Central Government Reference No. 1 here. As per the feedback received through the letter dated 12.12.2022 and subsequent to the meeting of State Level Project Sanctioning Committee (SLSC) under National Agriculture Development Scheme held on 11.01.2023, Rs. 49.27 lakh has been approved. 4 is here. Issued by letter dated January 30, 2023. Accordingly, it was under consideration of the Government to approve the" Maharashtra Nutri Cereals" Mission under the National Agriculture Development Scheme for the years 2022-23 and 2023-24.
