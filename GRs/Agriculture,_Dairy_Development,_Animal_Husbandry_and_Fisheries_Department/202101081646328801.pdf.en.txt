The Proposal:
With a view to promote cooperative poultry farming in rural areas, the Government had adopted a policy for setting up of cooperative poultry farms through financial guarantee from the National Cooperative Development Corporation, New Delhi. Accordingly, in the State of Maharashtra, a total of 73 Poultry Farming Societies have been approved from 1986-87 to 1997-98 on the basis of National Cooperative Development Corporation, New Delhi.
The scheme has been implemented by the Central and State Governments with a view to develop and conserve poultry in rural areas and to generate employment.
A total of 73 projects of Cooperative Poultry Farming Societies in the State have been funded by the National Cooperative Development Corporation (NCDC) through State Guarantee Funding in the form of loan and share capital from the State Government.
Under this scheme, the National Cooperative Development Corporation, New Delhi has revised the norms of financial assistance under the scheme of financial assistance to cooperative poultry institutions by the government from time to time and accordingly, the projects of cooperative poultry institutions have been funded by the state government as per the norms.
A total of 73 projects of cooperative poultry farming institutions have been sanctioned by the State Government.
Funding is provided under the program. Of these, 13 are currently operational and 26 are closed. 31 institutions have been taken into liquidation and 3 institutions have been fully debt-free. The condition of recovery of loans expected by the state government from these 70 institutions is very unsatisfactory and therefore, objections have been raised from time to time by the auditors in the audit of the department regarding this scheme and also by the Public Accounts Committee. A sub-committee appointed by the government in 1994 to review the projects funded earlier was also

As there is unsatisfactory loan recovery, it is recommended that new projects should not be funded under the existing scheme. According to this, the government has not approved any new projects after 1994.
The recovery of poultry cooperatives sponsored by the National Cooperative Development Corporation is very unsatisfactory and there is no response from the institutions to the recovery of loans. The National Cooperative Development Corporation (NCDC) has sanctioned a total of 70 existing, closed and defunct Cooperative Poultry Farming Societies (13 existing, 26 closed and 31 defunct). As on 31.03.2020, a total of Rs. 14514.87 lakh is due to the Government. Out of these, the outstanding dues of the existing 13 institutions at the end of March, 2020 are Rs. 2515.84 Lakhs, the outstanding dues of closed institutions at the end of March, 2020 is Rs. 8833.94 lakhs and 31 defaulting institutions Rs. 5283.95 Lakhs.
Considering the unsatisfactory condition of the cooperative poultry institutions, the National Cooperative Development Corporation sponsored poultry cooperative institutions will waive off 40 to 50 percent of the interest at the end of 14 years, depending on the stage of principal and interest. One Time Settlement for recovery of shares outstanding as on 31.03.2020. The Cabinet of Ministers in its meeting held on 22nd December, 2020 has taken the following decisions:
Government Decision: The National Cooperative Cooperative Societies sponsored by the National Cooperative Corporation, which are running and closed co-operative poultry farms, will agree to a fixed rate of interest at the end of 14 years of the loan provided to such poultry co-operative societies, according to the stage of the principal, interest due, and the state government will pay the interest as follows. Approval of the Government is hereby accorded for recovery of the share capital due at the end of 31.03.2020 and waiver of interest and penalty on the balance.
