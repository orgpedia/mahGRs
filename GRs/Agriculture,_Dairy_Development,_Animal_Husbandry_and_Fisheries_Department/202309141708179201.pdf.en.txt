(2) Department of Agriculture and Forestry No. 33011/8/2023 (663574)-MAG-ADF-4, D. 08.09.2023 under the Chairmanship of Additional Chief Secretary (Agriculture). The minutes of the meeting held on 01.09.2023.
Introduction: The State of the Union. Below Average Rainfall till the end of 08.09.2023. The low rainfall has also affected crop sowing and is likely to adversely impact fodder production and availability of fodder required for livestock in the state.
Even during the average rainfall, there is a shortfall of about 44% fodder considering the available livestock and available fodder. This will further aggravate the situation of fodder shortage in times of scarcity. Effective measures need to be taken to address this.
Animal husbandry and dairying are important occupations in the rural economy of the state, providing year-round employment and regular economic income. In times of scarcity, livestock farmers are limited in providing nutritious fodder to livestock due to reduced fodder yield. As a result, the low quality of feed available to the livestock farmers has a far-reaching adverse effect on the health of the animals as well as on the milk production.
Corn is a nutritious food because it is a healthy food. It also increases milk production. Also, it is a good choice as it is nutritious and long-lasting. The following are the benefits of feeding chicken to cattle.
(a) Continuous milk production.
2) The immune system of the animal remains intact.
3) The reproductive capacity of cows and buffaloes is maintained.
4) Reduced labor costs.

In the above background, during the measures taken by the Relief and Rehabilitation Department in times of scarcity, it is necessary to give priority to providing fodder to the cattle instead of other teas. To ensure uniformity in the procurement price, the government was considering fixing the base price for maize fodder.
Government Decision: During the measures to be taken by the Relief and Rehabilitation Department to overcome the possible fodder shortage situation in the state, it is necessary to provide millets prepared from maize fodder to the cattle in the scarcity/ scarcity-prone areas to keep their health good and not to adversely affect the production capacity. The price of a maize seedling is Rs. 6.50 per kg subject to the following conditions:
1. The murgha to be purchased should be in the form of silage bale in an airtight condition.
The acidity (pH) of the sillage bile to be purchased should be 4.0 to 4.2 and there should be no fungal infection in it.
The amount of butyric acid in Silage Bail should be less than 0.2 percent and the amount of lactic acid should be more than 3 percent.
4. The stubble prepared from maize fodder should contain 65-70% moisture and 30-35% dry matter.
5. The quantity of dry matter in maize husk in Silage Bail should be as follows:
