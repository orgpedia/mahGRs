Madame Cama Marg, Hutatma Rajguru Chowk, Mantralaya, Mumbai-400 032.
Date: 9th of August 2018
Read: 1. D.O. No.Misc 2014/ C.R.29/ Try.Adm.5 of Finance Department, Dy. December 2, 2016. Sanleco-2017/ PFMS/ 45 dated 12th June, 2017
3. Decision of the Government of the Synchronization of Agriculture and Padum Department. June 16, 2017
The Proposal:
As per the policy of the Government, it has been decided to adopt Public Financial Management System (PFMS) for Centrally Sponsored Schemes and Centrally Aided Schemes of the Agriculture Department. The Nodal Officer, State Plan Manager and First Level Agency for the implementation of this system have been announced under the Government Decision of Reference No. 3. However, some of the officers have retired and some have been transferred. Therefore, the newly appointed officers are required to be registered with the State Planning Manager and First Level Agency on the Public Financial Management System.
But since the appointment of the State Plan Manager and First Level Agency has been made in the form of designation and name under the Government decision of Reference No. 3, the Government decision has to be issued again and again if the concerned officer retires or the concerned officer is transferred. To avoid this re-orientation, the government was considering the appointment of State Plan Managers and First Level Agencies only by designation. Accordingly, the Government is taking the following decisions by superseding the Government Resolution of Reference No. 3.
The government has decided to declare a nodal officer for implementation of Public Financial Management System (PFMS), State Plan Manager and First Level Agency for each Centrally Sponsored and Centrally Aided Scheme.
Accordingly, the Deputy Secretary/ Joint Secretary (Budget and Planning) is being declared as the nodal officer of the Department for Centrally Sponsored Schemes and Centrally Aided Schemes of the Department of Agriculture and the State Level Scheme Manager and First Level Agency are being declared as follows.
