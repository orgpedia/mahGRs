The Proposal:
Read No. 1 here. As per the Government decision dated 30.10.2015, to promote milk production in the State, 06/04/02, administrative approval has been given to the innovative State Level General, Scheduled Caste Sub-Plan and District Level Tribal Area Appropriation for distribution of milk hybrid cows/ buffaloes. As per the decision of the government, a milch animals purchase committee has been formed to purchase milch animals to the selected beneficiaries under this scheme. However, due to lack of clarity in the government's decision regarding the group head, member and member secretary of the committee, the matter of determining the structure of the milch animals purchase committee was under the consideration of the government. Accordingly, the government has issued the following circular.
Government Circular: 06/04/02 Distribution of milk hybrid cows/ buffaloes groups to promote milk production in the state. The structure of the Milk Procurement Committee here is explained as follows in the General Guidelines, Terms and Conditions on the implementation of the scheme on page 3 of the Government Decision No. 11.
