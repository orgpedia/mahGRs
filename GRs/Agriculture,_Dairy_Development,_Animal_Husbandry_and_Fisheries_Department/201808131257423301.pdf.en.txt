In this regard, it is necessary to effectively control the Shendri Bonded Weed Management Campaign at the district level.
Under the CropSap scheme, the government is taking the following decisions to appoint a committee at the district level to avoid financial loss due to pest disease of the camphor crop and to coordinate at the district level, to conduct regular reviews and to implement the camphor control program as a campaign, especially for the control of pest on cotton crop.
Government's decision:
Approval is being given to constitute the following committees to plan, implement and review the measures to be taken in the cotton growing districts in terms of management of Sendri Bondi weeds on cotton crops at the district level.
