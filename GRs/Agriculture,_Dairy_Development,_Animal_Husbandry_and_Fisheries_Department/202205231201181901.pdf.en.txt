Preamble: Dated 25.6.2021. In the meeting chaired by the Minister (Dairy), the representatives of the farmers' organizations were mainly agitating for the" guaranteed price" to the milk producing farmers. The government provides fair and remunerative price (FRP) for sugarcane. The farmers have been demanding a fair and remunerative price (FRP) for milk. In response to this demand, The Minister (Dairy) assured the representatives of the farmers' organizations and other dignitaries present that the government will immediately consider the demand and take necessary action in this regard. As per the discussion in the meeting, the proposal to bring an Act on the lines of" Fair and Remunerative Price" (FRP) for milk should be brought before the Cabinet. Minister (Dairy).
Incidentally, it may be mentioned that the Government has consistently provided substantial grants/ financial assistance by intervening from time to time in the volatile situation of the dairy sector. However, providing subsidy from time to time is not helpful for the dairy sector. This is because the participation in dairy farming in the state is only 0.5 to 1% and the remaining 99% of the dairy sector is run by private and cooperative. In the case of private sector, the decision on the price to be paid to the milk producing farmers for the purchase of milk and the selling price for the purchased milk is completely taken by the private traders mutually.
Since the central government has not fixed the minimum support price (MSP) for milk, the government cannot impose any restriction on the private sector regarding the rate given for milk.
Considering all the above, the government was considering the formation of a cabinet sub-committee to examine the financial implications/ burden, scope and sensitivity of the subject if the Act is to be implemented to provide fair price for milk.
