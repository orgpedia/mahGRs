Government circular
It has come to the notice of the Government that some social workers or other persons who complain to the Government or the field office about certain issues/ matters. But without any understanding of the subject matter/ without adding any evidence/ without collecting documentary documents, just make a complaint of 1-2 pages out of personal grudge or just for the purpose of harassment or for other reasons. The General Administration Department has already issued orders from time to time on how to file a complaint and not to make an anonymous complaint and what documents should be attached to the complaint. The complainant is required to give his name/ address/ telephone number/ mobile number/ signature in the complaint, but this is not done.
Some employee unions complain on their letter pad and since no proof/ documents are attached, it is not possible to verify the complaints and the time of the government's field office is wasted. Therefore, if any anonymous complaint comes or if a complaint comes without evidence, it will not be taken into consideration, this matter should be brought to the notice of the concerned complainant and the case should be closed.
If the complaint is made in the prescribed manner, is not anonymous and is accompanied by proper documentary evidence, the complaints regarding such administrative delay should be examined by the competent authority. In some cases, if required, the Regional Deputy Commissioner may inquire into the grievances of some of the districts under him through the machinery of other districts under him. This will help to get the right facts.
If any criminal complaint is received, it should be forwarded to the concerned State Women Commission/ State Child Rights Commission/ Police. Also, if there is a complaint of corruption, it should be transferred to the regional office of the Anti-Corruption Bureau and its report should be sought and sent to the government along with the report for appropriate action.
