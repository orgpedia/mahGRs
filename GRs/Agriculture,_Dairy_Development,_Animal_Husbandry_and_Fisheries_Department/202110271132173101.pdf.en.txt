Introduction: The state has a large vegetable area. The Punyashlok Ahilyadevi Holkar Nursery Scheme is proposed to be implemented under the National Agriculture Development Scheme with a view to increasing the income of farmers by promoting vegetable production. As the proposed cost ceiling and subsidy limit for the project are in line with the existing expenditure and subsidy limits under the Centrally Sponsored National Horticulture Mission, the proposal for approval of the project to be implemented under the National Agriculture Development Scheme would have been submitted to the State Level Project Sanctioning Committee set up for implementation and monitoring of the National Agriculture Development Scheme for approval. As the proposal was approved by the chairman of the committee and the chief secretary, the matter of issuing an appropriate government decision in this regard was under the consideration of the government.

The format of Punyashlok Ahilyadevi Holkar Nursery Scheme will be as follows: (1) Importance of the scheme: Maharashtra is a pioneer in horticulture and a large number of fruits and vegetable crops are grown and produced commercially in the state. They are also exported in large quantities. In the last 2 to 3 years, the trend of farmers towards exportable and poison-free production of crops is increasing. In view of this, the demand for pest and disease free vegetable plants produced in a controlled environment of vegetable plants is increasing in a big way. Therefore, there is scope to set up small nurseries producing quality stems/ saplings in every taluka of the state.
