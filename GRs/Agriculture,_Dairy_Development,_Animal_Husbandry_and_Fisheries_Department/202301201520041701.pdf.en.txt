The Proposal:
The Department of Agriculture implements various Central and State sponsored schemes as well as externally aided projects. After the annual action plan of the centrally sponsored schemes is finalised, the government receives funds in one or two tranches in a year. Similarly, state sponsored schemes also receive funds in a phased manner. Although the Agriculture Department receives funds in a phased manner, the agricultural sector operates on a season-wise basis and about 75% of the area under cultivation in Kharif and Rabi seasons is covered by various crops in the Kharif season itself. Therefore, the Kharif season is very important for the economy and farmers of the state. It is necessary to implement the elements that will complement the crops of this season in the pre-Kharif and post-season period. This includes tools and equipment.
As per the decision of the government, administrative approval has been given for the implementation of the State Sponsored Agricultural Mechanization Scheme. Under this scheme, component number-3 of the Central Government's Agriculture Mechanization Sub Mission, providing subsidy to individual beneficiary farmers for the purchase of agricultural implements/ machines and component number-4, providing subsidy to agricultural implements/ machines banks are implemented as per the guidelines of the Central Government's Agriculture Mechanization Sub Mission.
For the year 2022-23, Rs. Rs 400 crore has been allocated for this. Department of Finance Budget as per the provisions of the Government Resolution dated 4th June, 2022
