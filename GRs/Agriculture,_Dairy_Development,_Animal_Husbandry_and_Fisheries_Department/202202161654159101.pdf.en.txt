The Proposal:
The State Tourism Policy was announced on 4th May, 2016 with a view to increase the tourism sector in the State by 10% per annum and to contribute 15% of the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) and to create one million jobs in the tourism sector by 2025. Accordingly, the State Agro Tourism Policy has been approved under the Government Resolution dated 28th September, 2020.
According to this policy, the agro-tourism centers in the state are being run by individual farmers and institutions. At present, the agro-tourism centres run by farmers or by farmers' organizations are not getting the benefit of the schemes of the Agriculture Department. Considering the similarity between the objectives of the central government and the state government's schemes and agri-tourism policies, if the agri-tourism centers get the benefit of the schemes of the agriculture department, the agri-tourism centers will be self-sufficient and the reach of the schemes will increase in the rural areas.
