Kharif paddy and summer paddy crops have been notified for the notified areas in the state, for which the threshold production and the average production of the current year has been determined by taking rice into account.
4. Crop-wise insurance premium rate and insurance premium subsidy: Under this scheme, the insurance premium rate will be charged at a realistic rate. However, the rate of premium per hectare to be paid by all farmers for Kharif and Rabi seasons is as follows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| A.A.                          | crops                                                        | Insurance premium to be paid by farmers                                 |
| Kharif season                 | Rabi season                                                  |
| Crops and cereals             | 2% of the sum insured or the actual rate whichever is lower. | 1.5 per cent of the sum insured or the actual rate, whichever is lower. |
| Cash crops (Kapus and Onions) | 5% of the sum insured or the actual rate whichever is lower. | 5% of the sum insured or the actual rate whichever is lower.            |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Under this scheme, the difference between the crop-wise premium per hectare and the actual premium to be paid by the farmers will be considered as the rate of normal premium subsidy. The central share of the insurance premium subsidy has been capped under the new amendment. As per the existing guidelines of the Central Government of the scheme, after deducting the farmer's share of the minimum insurance premium received through e-tendering, the remaining amount was being given to the insurance company by the State and Central Government in equal proportions. However, as per the revised guidelines of the Central Government dated 17 th August, 2020, the cap on Central share of insurance premium subsidy shall continue to apply. As per the revised guidelines of the Central Government, the Central Government will pay 30 per cent to the crops of dry districts and 25 per cent to the crops of horticultural districts.
The State Government's premium subsidy to the insurance companies will be paid through the Agriculture Insurance Company of India (AIC) in various stages as per the procedure prescribed by the Central Government under the guidelines of the scheme.
5. Insurance Coverage Amount and Crop Insurance Premium to be Paid by Farmers: Under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, the crop-wise coverage amount for the year 2022-23 in the State has been generally fixed as per the crop loan rates fixed by the District Level Crop Loan Rate Committee. Similarly, there is a difference in crop-wise crop loan rates within the districts and crop loan rates have been approved at higher rates in some districts than the rates of the State Crop Loan Rate Committee. In this regard, the insured amount of the district where the rate is fixed higher than the maximum rate fixed by the State Crop Loan Rate Committee shall be the limit fixed for that crop.
The details of district wise, crop wise insurance cover amount, insurance premium rate, insurance premium subsidy etc., for District Groups (Cluster) No. 1 to 12 are enclosed in Form A-1 to A-66.

The State Level Crop Insurance Coordination Committee has notified crop-wise insurance sector components taking into account the average production in the last 5 years of the highest production in the last 7 years, area under the crop and the available manpower to carry out adequate crop harvesting experiments in the current season. In doing so, major crops in all the districts of the state have been included. The required number of crop cutting experiments have been planned as per the standard method of estimation of yield for all the notified crops.
At present, 12 crop harvesting experiments are planned at the Revenue Board and Revenue Board block level.
Accordingly, while the Revenue Board or the Revenue Board is planning the crop harvesting experiment at the regional level at the block level, the District Collector of the concerned district is being given the freedom to plan the crop harvesting experiment at the gram panchayat level for at least 12 crops. The Collector should plan the crop cutting experiments for the notified crops in the notified area for crop insurance as per the prescribed method in accordance with the available resources, manpower at the local level. Crop insurance should be used to calculate the average productivity of all these crop harvesting experiments to determine the average productivity of the notified crop of the notified area.
Under the scheme, for Kharif 2022 and Rabi 2022-23, the average productivity in the insurance sector component of the current season will be determined by giving 90% weightage to the yield obtained through crop cutting experiments for paddy, soybean and cotton crops and 10% weightage to the technical yield. While determining the technical output, the production based on the technology obtained through Maha-Agritech projects will be within the limit of 30% lower/ higher tolerance limit of the production obtained through crop cutting experiments. In order to get accurate and timely production forecast, it is necessary to conduct crop harvesting experiments with the help of satellite images, as well as use modern techniques for crop production forecasting, e.g. The central government has suggested the use of drones (Dynamic Remotely Operated Navigation Equipment), smartphones, etc.
With a view to obtain accurate data in a transparent manner, it has been made mandatory to use the mobile app developed by the Central Government for crop harvesting experiments under this scheme. No other system/ app should be used for crop harvesting experiments. The selection of the plot should be done by the random method prescribed for crop harvesting experiment or by using remote sensing technique if possible.
7. Insurance Coverage: Under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, farmers will get insurance cover for losses due to non-avoidable reasons for Kharif 2022 and Rabi 2022-23.
7.1.Prevented sowing/ planting/ germination due to adverse climatic factors:

(a) The criteria for grant of compensation shall be as follows: (i) If the expected production of the notified crop in the notified area is less than 50% of the average production of the previous 7 years of the notified crop, all the notified insurance areas shall be eligible for such assistance.
Based on the representative suggestions, the concerned Collector should issue a notification regarding the payment of compensation for the notified insurance area for a particular crop and group of crops by meeting the necessary provisions for determining this risk.
The amount of damage and the compensation to be paid will be determined according to the joint inspection of the state government officials and the insurance company.
Farmers who have paid the insurance premium amount before the notification of the loss to be announced by the concerned Collector or the insurance premium amount has been deducted from their account will be eligible for this assistance. All the banks should ensure that the insurance premium of all the loanee farmers is deducted within 15 days of the sanction of crop loan in case of willing loanee farmers and the same is applicable to all the willing loanee farmers. Otherwise, the concerned banks will be responsible for the compensation of the farmers who have been deprived of insurance coverage due to the fault of the banks.

However, this provision should only be used in exceptional circumstances.
10.3. Determination of compensation based on average yield at the end of the season. (a) Technological basis for determination of compensation for notified crops other than paddy, soyabean and cotton. If the average yield per hectare of the insured crop in a given area falls below the threshold yield, it is assumed that all the insured farmers in that area have suffered a loss.
The threshold yield or guaranteed yield of an insurance component shall be the average yield of 5 years out of the best of the previous 7 years in that season for all crops x the risk level. Under the scheme, the risk level for all crops has been fixed at 70% for Kharif and Rabi seasons 2022-23.
Average production in the last 7 years of the threshold production season best 5 years x 70% (Risk Level)

GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: PROPEVIO-2022/ P.S. 72/11-A
2. Formula for determining compensation:
Average annual production
Compensation- The sum insured (Rs. It's per. (a) the production
(b) Procedure for determination of compensation for paddy, soyabean and cotton crops based on technology: 1. The compensation to be determined under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana is 90% weightage to the produce obtained through crop cutting experiments in the insurance sector unit as determined by the Government.
The average production at the insurance sector component level will be determined by giving 10% weightage to the production.
The production is based on the technology obtained through Maha-Agritech projects while determining the technical output
30% of the yield obtained through harvesting experiments will be within the limit of lower/ higher tolerance limit. If
Average yield per hectare of an insured crop in a given area
If the production is less than the production, it will be assumed that all the insured farmers in the area have suffered losses.
The threshold yield of an insurance component is the best 5 out of the last 7 years for that season for all crops.
Average output for the year will be x risk level. Kharif and Rabi seasons for all crops under the scheme
The risk level has been fixed at 70 per cent for 2022-23.
Threshold production= 5 years best average production in the last 7 years of the season X 70% (Risk level)
3. Formula for determining compensation:
Average Production= (Crop Harvesting Experiment yield× 0.90)+ (Technical Yield x 0.10) The production based on the technology obtained from the Maha-Agritech projects while determining the technical yield is the crop
30% of the yield obtained through harvesting experiments will be within the limit of lower/ higher tolerance limit.
For example, while implementing the scheme, the average production assuming 10% technical yield is as follows: 1000 kg/ ha.
The production achieved on the basis of technology is 1500 kg/ ha.
Technical production Cap@ 30% 1300 kg/ ha.
Average yield (1000x 0.90)+ (1300 x 0.10) 900+130
1030 kg/ ha.
Threshold production- Average production for the current year
The amount of insurance cover (Rs. It's per. (a) the production
Fixed T.Y. The threshold yield will be determined on the basis of the average yield of the last 5 years out of the previous 7 years for the notified crops and the level of risk determined.

GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: PROPEVIO-2022/ P.S. 72/11-A
4. The data of production at the insurance sector component level under the MahaGritech project will be taken into account while determining the average production based on technology. If these data are not received in time, the production data obtained through crop harvesting experiments will be taken into account while determining the average production.
General Instructions regarding Crop Harvesting Experiment: 1. If the crop harvesting experiment fails to cover the area under the crop as per the number prescribed in the insurance area component, the following action shall be taken.
Where there is not enough area under the crop, adverse climatic conditions/ infrastructural facilities do not allow sufficient crop to be harvested, the concerned insurance sector shall first assume the average yield of the nearest equivalent insurance sector unit for the unit. Only if it is not possible to do so, the insurance sector concerned assumes the production of a higher unit than the unit. However, this provision can be used only in exceptional circumstances and at least for insurance sector entities, and not to prevent crop harvesting experiments. The district level machinery needs to ensure that adequate crop harvesting experiments are carried out in all the notified insurance area units as planned. The threshold product will not be released before the insurance claim is settled.
It will be mandatory/ necessary for the State Government/ concerned field staff to provide full opportunity to the insurance companies to co-witness the crop harvesting experiments and provide electronic/ physical copies of the relevant photographs and charts immediately. Field level staff/ officials engaged in crop harvesting
In order to coordinate with them and to mobilize manpower accordingly, the schedule of crop cutting experiment should be informed to the crop insurance company at least 7 days in advance.
Crop insurance companies will be required to appoint one of their skilled representatives at the district level for at least three months during the harvesting season to control, coordinate and obtain necessary information about the crop harvesting experiment in the district. For this purpose, the district administration should make arrangements to facilitate the exchange of information on crop harvesting experiments by providing the necessary space and facilities in the office of the District Superintendent Agriculture Officer.
If the distance between two rows of tur is up to 180 cm, then it should be considered as a continuous crop and its production should be recorded in the crop harvest. If the sowing distance between two rows of turmeric is more than 180 c.m. then the amount of increase in the distance between the two rows does not reduce the production of turmeric.
Crops occupy the open space. Because of this, there is a problem in determining the production of tur by recording the distance between the crop and removing the distance between the two rows of tur. Therefore, if the distance between two rows of tur is up to 180 cm, then the crop should be harvested by considering it as a continuous crop of tur and the production should be fixed. However, if the distance between two rows is more than 180 cm, then the distance between the next two rows will be 180 cm, excluding the plot for harvesting the crop. The site should be selected within the m.
10.4. Localised Disasters: Under this component, the loss of notified crop due to damage caused by localised natural calamities such as inundation of insured area, landslide, hailstorm, cloudburst or lightning, will be determined by conducting panchnama at individual level.
The risk will be applicable if the crop is damaged due to increased water level or overflowing well or flood water entering the field and the farm remains submerged for a long time.

GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: PROPEVIO-2022/ P.S. 72/11-A
The crop report prepared by the district level officers, local media reports and photographs etc. should be used.
4. The data from the Automatic Weather Station authorized under the Mega Project will be used to determine the compensation. The following tips should also be used.
Acute Drought Situation- Data collected with the help of satellite under MahaAgritech, Maha-Relief Project as per the Drought Code of 2016.
(ii) Drought conditions or rainfall declared by the Government.
3. Abnormal increase or decrease in temperature as compared to long-term average.
4. Widespread outbreak of pests and diseases.
5. Natural calamities including floods resulting in extensive crop loss 5. Differences in planting area: In order to avoid over-reporting of sown area and over-insurance coverage, stakeholders should verify all land records, bank documents, revenue documents and loan proposals etc. covered under the Sundur Scheme and take appropriate action. The scheme provides for crop rotation and protection against losses due to local calamities. However, if any discrepancy is found between the sown area and the insured area, such insurance proposals will be cancelled. Below are the steps to be followed in this regard.
The provision of difference in area of cultivation will be applicable to the major crops for which the general sowing area data at the block level will be available on the National Crop Insurance Portal using remote sensing or other technology from MNCFC. Data from any other source, including the state government, will not be considered.
However, if the area covered is more than the sown/ sown area reported at the Taluk level, such irregularity/ discrepancy shall be brought to the notice of the Department of Agriculture, Government of India and Ministry of Farmers Welfare, Government of India in writing after the last date of participation but before finalizing the matching of applications and documents received by the banks. The list of bank branches should also be mentioned. So that the government can take cognizance of these cases and the concerned banks will make appropriate corrections before finalizing the season data.
(2) The decision of the Government of India in respect of discrepancies in the insurance sector shall be final. If the difference between the sown area and the insured area reported by MNCFC is more than 30% at the taluk level, all the insured area units in such taluk will fall under the area discrepancy category.
Accordingly, the excess area will not be treated as insured and the premium amount of the concerned farmers will be forfeited and dedicated to the Government of India Technology Fund.
4) As per the sector reform component, the amount of insurance premium reimbursed by the insurers will be transferred to the Central/ State Government in the ratio of 50:50.
5) The details regarding the area improvement coefficient considered in the insurance compensation will be made available on the National Crop Insurance website.
13.No Liability for Damage Compensation: The liability for damage as per the provisions of the scheme shall be borne by the insurance company concerned. Under this scheme, insurance companies will bear the liability of up to 110 per cent of the total deposit insurance premium amount in the district group in a year. However, in case the amount of crop insurance compensation payable in a year is more than 110% of the sum assured, the State Government will bear the burden of more than 110% of the premium amount and if the due crop is more than 110% of the premium amount.
Page 46 of 17.
# Page 18
GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: PROPEVIO-2022/ P.S. 72/11-A
If the amount of insurance compensation is less than the total deposit insurance premium amount in the district group, then the insurance company will keep a maximum of 20 percent of the insurance premium amount and return the remaining insurance premium amount to the state government. Below is an example of how this is done.
Situation-1: If the amount of deposit insurance premium in the district group is 100 crore and the compensation payable is 115 crore, then the insurance company will pay a compensation of Rs 110 crore and the state government will pay Rs. 5 crore.
Situation-2: If the premium amount deposited in the district group is 100 crore and the compensation payable is 75 crore, then the insurance company will pay a compensation of Rs. 20 crore and Rs.
5 crore to the State government.
Method of payment of compensation to farmers:
The insurance companies are required to reimburse the farmers insurance premium received by them and the advance insurance premium received from the government (first installment) for claims arising out of sowing/ transplantation due to adverse weather conditions/ local calamities during the season without waiting for the payment of the final insurance premium (second installment). As per Section 64B of the Insurance Act, the insurance company is required to pay the compensation in such cases by using the insurance premium received for the affected area, the farmer's share and the advance insurance premium (first installment) paid by the state government.
2) Claims for post-harvest losses based on production figures are required to be made on receipt of the second installment of insurance subsidy from the Government. The government is required to disburse the second installment based on the interim insurance participation data received on approval of applications on the portal within 15 days after the deadline for insurance registration. The remaining insurance premium is to be paid by the government, if applicable, after full verification of the insurance registration data for the season.
(3) In the provision of fixing the compensation at the end of the season, the compensation for the notified crops in the notified area shall be determined by the competent authority of the insurance company on the basis of the insurance proposal received from the bank/ insurance representative after receiving the production data as per the schedule prescribed by the State Government.
4) The compensation to the farmers participating in the scheme will be transferred by the financial institution to the concerned bank/ financial institution through electronic fund transfer system and thereafter, the detailed information of the compensation in writing will be provided by the insurance company. After receiving the compensation amount, the bank/ financial institution shall credit the compensation amount in the account of the eligible farmer within one week and submit the certificate to the insurance company. This information will also have to be published on the notice board and insurance website by the bank.
5) If the farmers have participated in the insurance scheme through insurance agents, the compensation amount will be directly credited to the farmers' account through the insurance company and they will be informed about it and the information of such farmers will be required to be published on the insurance website.
6) The compensation to be paid to the farmers as specified above shall also be paid in respect of loss due to sowing/ non-sowing due to adverse climatic conditions, loss due to local natural calamities or post-harvest losses.
7) Complaints of farmers and other stakeholders involved in the insurance scheme will need to be addressed by the insurance company without delay.

GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: PROPEVIO-2022/ P.S. 72/11-A
At least 10 crop harvesting experiments should be carried out in the Mandal/ Mandal group notified as insurance area unit and at least 16 crop harvesting experiments should be carried out in the notified block. Crop harvesting experiments based on the notified area applicable to the Mandal or group of Mandal and Taluka should be considered for determining the compensation under this scheme.
The figures declared by any government department/ institution in respect of losses due to drought, scarcity situation and flood should not be taken into account while determining the compensation under the scheme. For this, the average income data collected through crop harvesting experiments and based on the crop survey estimation experiment conducted at the regional level for the estimation of crop production by the state government should be taken into account.
22. The field work of crop harvesting experiment has been entrusted to the field staff of Revenue, Agriculture and Rural Development departments respectively. The Collector, Chief Executive Officer, Zilla Parishad and District Superintending Agriculture Officer should control the crop harvesting experiment in the notified insurance area through the Tahsildar, Block Development Officer and Taluk Agriculture Officer respectively for effective implementation of the crop harvesting experiment in their respective areas. Under this scheme, the central government has made it mandatory to use a mobile app for crop harvesting experiments. Otherwise, the central government will not disburse the amount of the insurance premium subsidy. This should be brought to the notice of all the field officers and employees and implemented accordingly.
Payment of insurance premiums and cases:
The banking system used in the National Agriculture Insurance Scheme and the National Crop Insurance Program under the Prime Minister Crop Insurance Scheme will continue to be applicable to cooperative banks.
