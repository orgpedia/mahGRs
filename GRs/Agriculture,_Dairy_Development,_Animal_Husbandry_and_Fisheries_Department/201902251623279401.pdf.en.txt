Introduction: The registration of ground water fisheries cooperative societies was being done on the basis of the norms laid down by the Department of Fisheries in the contractual policy for pond/ reservoir fishing and the provisions of the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960 and Rules, 1961. The government has decided to implement a revised policy on the leasing of ponds/ reservoirs for fishing. Under the 97th Constitutional Amendment, the Department of Cooperation has adopted a policy for qualitative development of cooperative institutions by bringing about a paradigm shift in the functioning of cooperative institutions. The Government Decision dated 26/06/2014 was issued by adjusting all the previous Government Decisions and Circulars together to incorporate the above changes in the functioning of Fisheries Cooperative Societies and to bring about coherence and uniformity in the policy of the Department of Fisheries and the policy of registering Groundwater Fisheries Cooperative Societies (Primary) and Groundwater District Fishermen Societies on the water bodies.
The fishermen have submitted their representations regarding the policy of registration of the Groundwater Fisheries Cooperative Society, the Federation of Fisheries Cooperative Societies to be formed on the water body and the Groundwater Fishermen Union in accordance with the stay given in the Lake Contract Policy. Also, with the change in the policy on leasing of ponds/ water bodies, it was necessary to change the policy on the criteria for registration of institutions. Therefore, after considering all these aspects and concluding the Government decision on registration dated 30.06.2017, it was under the consideration of the Government to issue a self-explanatory and all-inclusive and all-encompassing revised Government decision.
