About 5.59 lakh hectare area of 140 taluka orchards in the state. Every year 55-60 lakh saplings are produced. The government has allocated Rs 18 crore for this.
The work is being done on contract basis by labourers. As some of the workers have gone to court, they have to pay the amount as per the court order. Also, due to the changing climate, the natural conditions have to be broken for the work on the agriculture-like nursery. This does not stop spending within the limits of the approved budget provision. Therefore, it is necessary to spend more. If the works are stopped due to lack of funds, it may affect the production of stems/ plants and alternatively the horticulture sector of the state. For this, the Commissionerate of Agriculture had requested for approval to spend the pending payments of the financial year 2019-20 within the limit of 10 percent of the available provision for the financial year 2020-21.
