Nanded district of Maharashtra has a population of 33,61,292 as per the 2011 census and comprises 16 talukas. The land in Nanded district is very fertile and there is ample scope for horticultural farming due to the Vishnupuri Dam in this area. Vasantrao Naik Marathwada Agricultural University, under Parbhani, Nanded district does not have a Government Agriculture/ Affiliated College at present. Therefore, if the government agricultural college is started in this district, it will be convenient for the students who have completed higher secondary education to get agricultural knowledge in their own district.
If the students get education in agriculture, it will be a great help in improving agriculture and in turn, the economic situation. It will also create extension workers, gram sevaks, krishi mitras and expert mentors at the village level. Apart from this, it will be possible to provide agricultural education, agricultural advice and services to the farmers so that they can do farming in a modern way, which will increase the productivity of the farmers' crops and in turn increase their economic status and help the country progress. At present, there is no government agriculture college in Nanded district, so it is necessary to establish a government agriculture college in Nanded.
According to the criteria of the fifth dean committee of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, 30 hectares of land is required for the proposed Government Nanded Agricultural College. At present, a total of 105.73 hectares of land is available under Vasantrao Naik Marathwada Agricultural University, 52 hectares of land under the Agricultural Technology School in Nanded district, 36.33 hectares of land at Bafna Tea Point and 17.40 hectares of land at Dhanegaon Farm under the Cotton Research Center. With this, 30 hectares of land will be available for the establishment of Government Agriculture College in Nanded.
