Read- Commissioner Animal Husbandry, Pune No. RONI/ ANRO/ 86/2016/6677/ 78/2021, Choice-12 dated 19.8.2021.
The Proposal:
The Quality Control Laboratory, Goregaon, Mumbai carries out pre-export inspection of animal and meat products using modern machinery and issues inspection reports/ certificates for export. The laboratory has been accredited by NABL (National Accreditation Board of Testing Calibration Laboratories). The laboratory has also been awarded the APEDA Designated Laboratory status. The institute receives service charge every year from the testing certificates of meat products conducted by this laboratory. However, the expenditure on maintenance of machinery, required technical manpower, fuel, electricity charges, prescribed daily expenses etc. has to be borne by the Regional Joint Commissioner, Mumbai Division, Mumbai with the approval of the Commissioner Animal Husbandry from time to time. It takes time to get that approval. Meanwhile, the possibility of laboratory infection cannot be ruled out. Also, there are security issues when you buy a product. Considering all these factors, the Government was considering to allow the Institute to open its own Private Accounting Account with Reserve Bank of India to spend 10% of the service charges collected from Quality Control Laboratory, Goregaon, Mumbai for the essential laboratory materials and accessories. Accordingly, the government has taken the following decisions:
