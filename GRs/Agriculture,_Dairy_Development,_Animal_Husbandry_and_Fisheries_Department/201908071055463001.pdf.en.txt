The Proposal:
In the Konkan region, the paddy crop is around 4.50 lakh. The area has potential for increased productivity. Out of this, about 1.50 lakh ha area has potential for sowing of pulses and pulses during Rabi/ Summer season. However, very few of these areas are cropped twice. After the paddy crop, the fertility of the land decreases by growing paddy again in the next year, so it is possible to grow pulses after the paddy crop and crops like groundnut where irrigation facilities are available. This will help maintain the fertility of the soil. Accordingly, the Government was contemplating to launch a programme for development of rice seed chain for implementation of demonstration based on cropping pattern of paddy crop under Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana in 2019-20. The government is taking the following steps:
GOVERNMENT DECISIONS: 1. In the year 2019-20, a programme of Rs. 360.00.lakh for development of rice seed chain under National Agriculture Development Scheme is being administratively approved as under: (Rs. million).
