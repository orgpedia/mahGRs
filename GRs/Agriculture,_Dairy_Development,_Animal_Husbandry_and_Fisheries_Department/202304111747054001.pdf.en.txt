The proposal-
Marine weed and algae farming is a type of soil-less agriculture. Most of the single-celled plants grown for this purpose fall into the category of microorganisms. It is also called phytoplankton, microphytes or planktonic algae. In algae farming, macros are large-sized algae that are grown and harvested. The commercial and industrial use of these algae is also very high. According to the 2019 report of the Central Institute of Seaweed Research (CMFRI), the production of seaweed in India was 18,400 tons. Considering that seaweed and algae farming are beneficial in reducing carbon emissions and its utility in wastewater treatment, biofuels and industrial applications, it is necessary to promote algae farming.
In the Budget Session of 2023-24. The Deputy Chief Minister and Finance Minister in the budget speech have announced the formation of a study group on seaweed and algae farming. Therefore, the matter of setting up a study group on marine weed and algae farming was under the consideration of the government.
Government's decision:
The Government is approving the constitution of the following Study Groups under the Chairmanship of Principal Secretary/ Secretary (Fisheries) to promote seaweed and algae farming in the coastal areas of the State:
