Agriculture: Agriculture is the most important industry in the state. However, the problem of labor for agricultural work is serious. The current wage rates and the resulting cost of farming, the lack of laborers, the lack of timely agricultural work and the income from direct farming are making the agricultural business difficult.
The government aims to double the income of farmers by 2022. For this, the sowing and post-harvesting process needs to be done through mechanization. If mechanization is used on a large scale, it is possible to increase agricultural production and increase the income of farmers.
About 80% of the farmers in Maharashtra are small and marginal landholders. The farmers are unable to purchase the machinery/ implements required for mechanization due to their financial condition. Farmers need assistance. Under the Centrally Sponsored Sub-Mission on Agricultural Mechanization, the programme of Agricultural Mechanization is implemented in the State. Similarly, under the National Food Security Mission, National Oilseeds and Oilseeds Mission and Integrated Horticulture Development Programme, a small scale mechanization programme is also implemented. However, it is not possible to supply agricultural implements to the farmers under these schemes as per the demand from the farmers. Earlier, a large amount of funds were being provided for agricultural mechanization through the National Agriculture Development Scheme. However, at present, the funds provided by the central government under the National Agriculture Development Scheme have reduced drastically. Therefore, it is not possible to provide much funds from the National Agriculture Development Scheme for agricultural mechanization. Also, subsidy is not admissible for high-cost machinery like tractors, sugarcane harvesters, power tillers in the National Agriculture Development Scheme. However, due to the huge demand for this machine, there are limitations in the effective implementation of the centrally sponsored agricultural mechanization scheme.
Therefore, considering the demand for agricultural implements by the farmers, the proposal of the state government to implement a separate agricultural mechanization scheme was under consideration, the government is taking the following decisions.
Government Decision: Administrative approval is being accorded for implementation of State Sponsored Scheme of Agricultural Mechanization from 2018-19.
The scheme should be implemented as per the guidelines of the Centrally Sponsored Sub-Mission on Agricultural Mechanization.

Under this scheme, the Central Government's Agriculture Mechanization Sub Mission Component No. 3- Grant of subsidy to individual beneficiary farmers for purchase of agricultural implements/ machines and Component No. 4- Subsidy to agricultural implements/ machinery banks should be implemented.
Under this scheme, the subsidy should be provided within the limit fixed by the Central Government for the machines and tools that are permissible as per the guidelines of the Agriculture Mechanization Sub-Mission of the Central Government. The subsidy will be transferred to the beneficiary's bank account through DBT.
Beneficiaries who have applied for the demand of implements/ machines under the Centrally Sponsored Sub-Mission on Agricultural Mechanization or other schemes, however, could not get the implements/ machines sanctioned from the said schemes due to lack of funds, should be given the benefit of the scheme by giving prior consent within the limit of subsidy available from this scheme.
The eligible beneficiaries, who have given prior consent, shall purchase the same machines/ tools which have been certified by the competent authority of the Central and State Governments as per the standards set by the BIS or other competent agencies.
7. The selected eligible beneficiaries will be given the amount of payment for the purchased machine/ tool for the proceedings from payment to the vendor to payment of subsidy to the beneficiaries. In the guidelines for implementation of the Mission for Enhanced Cultivation of Prosperous Farmers for 2018-19 issued vide Government Resolution dated 27.04.2018, vide Para No. 4.5. 4.5.10 to 4.5.14 in agricultural mechanization.
The beneficiaries of the Agricultural Mechanization Sub-Mission or any beneficiary under this scheme who have been given the benefit for the same machine/ tool should not be given the benefit again for the same machine/ tool within a period of 5 years.
If a farmer has submitted a proposal for subsidy by purchasing machines/ tools without prior consent, such a farmer will not be eligible for subsidy.
The Commissionerate of Agriculture should immediately develop an online system for accepting applications from farmers for selection of beneficiaries under agricultural mechanization.
Under this scheme, priority should be given to small and marginal farmers.
12. Priority should be given to Farmer Producer Companies, Farmer Groups to provide the benefit of subsidy under Agricultural Equipment Bank.
The subsidy amount should be credited to the loan account of the individual beneficiaries/ institutions who have taken loans from the bank and purchased machinery and implements for setting up the Agricultural Equipment Bank.
There is a huge demand for a tool/ machine, however, such tool/ machine is not included in the sub mission of agricultural mechanization, such tool/ machine is included in the state sponsored agricultural mechanization scheme, National Agriculture Development Scheme. The approval will be given by the State Level Project Approval Committee headed by the Additional Chief Secretary (Agriculture) and the State Level Approval Committee headed by the Chief Secretary.
