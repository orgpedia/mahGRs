GOVERNMENT DECISION NO. SHEVI-2018/ PR.No. 193/11-A,
Since the family of a farmer is not covered under the prevailing Gopinath Munde Farmers Accident Insurance Scheme, insurance coverage is not admissible to such persons in case of accidental death or disability of any member of his family. Hence, no financial benefit is provided to the farmer's family in case of an accident. Therefore, farmers and public representatives have demanded from time to time that financial benefits should be paid to farmers and their families in case of such accidents. Also Ma. In line with the announcement made by the Minister (Finance) in the budget speech, the government was considering to make the existing scheme more comprehensive by insuring about 3.04 crore people by including about 1.52 crore farmers who are not registered as farmers and 1 member of the family of the farmer who is not registered as a farmer under the newly published Agricultural Census 2015-16. Accordingly, approval is being given to implement the revised form of the scheme by revising the previous government decision on Gopinath Munde Farmers Accident Insurance Scheme.

Accidents due to natural calamities like lightning, lightning, flood, snakebite, scorpion bite, electric shock, road accidents, vehicle accidents, and accidents due to any other reason, cause death or disability to many farmers. A car accident can cause a family to lose income and create a difficult situation. In order to provide financial benefit to such accident-affected farmers/ their families, the government is approving the implementation of Gopinath Munde Farmers Accident Insurance Scheme for a total of 2 persons in the age group of 10 to 75 years, i.e., all the tenant farmers and any 1 member of the family of the farmer who is not registered as tenant account holder (parents, spouse of the farmer, son and unmarried daughter).
For the purpose of this scheme, one member of the family who is not registered as a tenant account holder shall be considered to be a parent, spouse of the farmer, son and unmarried daughter.
