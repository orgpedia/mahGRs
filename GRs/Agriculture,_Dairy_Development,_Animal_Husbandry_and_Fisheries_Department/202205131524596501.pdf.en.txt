The state of Maharashtra is endowed with vast aquatic resources.
This includes water, soil and soil. The state has 720. I have a long coastline with 456 fishing villages and 173 fish landing centres. water resources, for example. There are rivers, ponds, reservoirs, tanks, farmlands, etc. There is a huge scope for groundwater fisheries in the state and this sector has the potential to generate employment in rural areas. Fish is a rich source of protein, vitamins and minerals. However, the State Government is making continuous efforts to increase fish production to ensure availability of protein and increase per capita income of fish in the State.
Fishing is a source of income and employment for many fishermen. Therefore, various schemes are implemented by the state government with a view to develop the fisheries sector (marine, brackish water, groundwater) such as storing fish seeds in newly created ponds, cage fish culture, fish feed manufacturing factory, fish boat conservation, pond building, ice factory, fishing boat mechanization etc. However, in the fisheries sector, at times, climate change, overexploitation of natural resources, construction activities in the sea/ bay, fishing practices, unseasonal storms, etc. have adverse effects on the environment and fisheries, leading to many challenges.
For example, reduction in fish production, livelihood issues of fishermen, etc.
The Government was considering to constitute a Technical Committee to address the new challenges in the fisheries sector, emerging issues/ problems, increasing fish production, providing ventilation to fishermen, various issues related to fisheries, etc. The government was also considering setting up a review committee to take a decision on the report.
Government Decision: Technical Committee constituted under the Chairmanship of Commissioner Fisheries at the field level to suggest measures to address the emerging issues/ concerns related to the fisheries sector
