The Proposal:
150 crore in the State. The area is under cultivation in Kharif season, out of which 42 lakh is this. The area under cotton crop is about 46 lakh. The area is under soybean cultivation. The average production of cotton and soybean is 451 kg per annum. and 928 kg per kg.
254 per kg in the State. And 860 kg per hector. Both these crops are major crops of the state but due to various reasons their productivity is less as compared to the country's productivity. Similarly, in the case of these two crops, it has been found that the productivity of some farmers in the taluk using the right technology is very high, but the productivity of other farmers living in the same taluk and in the same agro-climatic zone is very low in comparison.
In this context, Ma. The Deputy Chief Minister in his Budget Speech for 2022-23 has announced that" Vidarbha and Marathwada have significant cotton and soyabean cultivation, Rs 1000 crore will be provided over the next 3 years for a special action plan to bring the productivity of all farmers there at par with progressive farmers and for value chain development."
Accordingly, in order to increase the productivity of the farmers of Maharashtra by holding detailed discussions with the scientists of the National Research Institute of Cotton and Soybean Crops, scientists of the 3 agricultural universities of the state, progressive farmers, private organizations and officials of the Agriculture Department, as well as to increase the participation of farmers in the value chain of these crops, the government was considering a special action plan for the next 3 years for the development of the value chain along with the increase in the productivity of crops such as cotton, soybean and other oilseeds such as groundnut, sunflower, karadai, mustard, sesame and jowar.

Government Decision: 1. Administrative approval is being accorded for implementation of" Special Action Plan for Productivity Enhancement and Value Chain Development of Cotton, Soyabean and other Oilseeds crops" for next 3 years (2022-23 to 2024-25). The total outlay for this special action plan is Rs. Rs 1000 crore will be allocated for this.
Under this special action plan, the talukas whose productivity of cotton and soybean crops is less than the state's average productivity will be selected on priority. The technology used by the progressive resource farmers with higher productivity in each taluka, as well as the technology recommended by agricultural universities, should be extended to other farmers in the taluka. For this, village-wise groups of farmers should be formed, the farmers of these groups should be provided with crop production technology through crop demonstrations, agricultural schools, field visits and training, their capacity building should be done and an action plan should be prepared for the promotion of crop production technology.
3. The component-wise details to be implemented under this Special Action Plan are as follows: )

Government Resolution No: VICTO-2122/ P.No. 39/4 A
Form of the special action plan and the procedure for implementation:
The general modalities of implementation of the said Special Action Plan shall be as follows, however, detailed and technical guidelines in this regard shall be issued at the level of Commissioner (Agriculture). Under this special action plan, the following procedures should be followed to increase the productivity and strengthen the value chain of cotton, soybean as well as oilseed crops such as groundnut, sunflower, karadai, mustard, sesame and jowar.
Taluks having productivity below the state average should be selected on priority for the above programme.
100 in selected taluks where the productivity is low. The area should be selected for grouping of farmers.
In these taluks, farmer groups should be formed in consultation with the Gram Krishi Vikas Samiti of the concerned village and the farmer producer company of such farmer groups should be formed or the existing farmer producer company should be affiliated.
(iv) the number of women members in the group of farmers. caste/ religion. Tribal, small and marginal farmers should be selected on priority.
v. The progressive high yielding farmer of the concerned village in the Farmers Resource Bank shall be preferred for selection as the group promoter of that group of farmers. So that they can explain the technology used by such farmers to other farmers.
vi. The concerned agricultural officers should hold meetings with the farmers of the groups and find out what are the specific problems for increasing the production.
vii. Productivity enhancement plan of the group based on the crop component of the increase in production should be prepared and examined by the scientists of the Agricultural University and Krishi Vigyan Kendras and their technical guidance should be taken from time to time while implementing the plan.
(viii) The average productivity of the farmer group for the last few years should be taken into account. According to the productivity plan, the target of productivity increase should be decided by discussing with the farmers and scientists how much productivity increase is expected after using the technology.
Considering the need for standardized seeds of new varieties for increased production, this special action plan will focus on strengthening the seed chain. Vasantrao Naik Marathwada Agricultural University, Maharashtra, has been established to develop new varieties that are resistant to pests and diseases, resistant to changing climatic conditions, for adequate production of basic and breeder seeds through agricultural universities.

The funds will be provided to Punjabrao Deshmukh Agriculture University, Akola and Mahatma Phule Agriculture University, Rahuri for development of infrastructure required for seed production. Similarly, the seed production program should also be implemented at the Taluka Seed Multiplication Center of the Agriculture Department.
The post-harvest handling, processing, banding and marketing of the produce should be done by farmers groups and farmer producer companies to ensure remunerative prices for the produce. For this, financial assistance will be provided to these farmer groups to build infrastructure. The focus will be on storage, cleaning and recycling of goods and capacity building of farmers through producer companies to connect them directly with buyers, processors and exporters as well as commodity markets.
Benefits should be provided to the beneficiaries of the project by integrating the existing schemes of the department like drip and drip irrigation, farm ponds, agricultural machinery and implements, agricultural processing and value addition, etc. to develop the infrastructure on the farm for increasing the productivity of crops.
5. Implementation of this special action plan. The Committee is being constituted under the Chairmanship of the Minister (Agriculture) as follows.
