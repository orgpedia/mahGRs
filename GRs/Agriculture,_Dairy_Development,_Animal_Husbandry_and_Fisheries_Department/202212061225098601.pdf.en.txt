Introduction: In order to increase the productivity of crops in the state, various experiments are carried out by farmers in different areas and productivity is increased. Such experimental farmers are encouraged and honored for their productivity, their willpower, morale are boosted and new technologies are used with more enthusiasm. This will help in increasing the income of farmers. Also, the scheme of inter-state crop competition is being implemented with the aim that other farmers of the area get guidance and add value to the total production of the state.
At present, there is a demand from the field level for changes in the crop competition due to many reasons such as excessive productivity in the crop competition crops, long time in declaring the results of the crop competition, competitive farmers not being able to have officials present at all places at the time of harvesting the crop, and not knowing whether there is consistency in the productivity of the concerned competitors as the state level prize depends on the productivity of a single year. Therefore, it is necessary to bring more transparency in crop competition, to increase the area and production of secondary and nutritious cereal crops, to give necessary publicity and publicity to more and more farmers to participate in the crop competition. For this purpose, the government was considering changing the procedure before the crop competition.
Considering the proposal submitted by the Commissionerate of Agriculture in this regard, to revise the guidelines of the crop competition, the earlier decision regarding the crop competition has been taken keeping in view the need to revise the criteria prescribed for different levels of crop competition in accordance with the time keeping in view the need for reconstitution of the committees, eligibility criteria, various forms, number of winners of the crop competition, format, increase in prize money, prescribing the schedule for the crop competition as well as changes in the criteria prescribed for different levels of crop competition. The Government decision dated 05.10.2020 was under consideration to modify the criteria for the crop competition for the year 2022-23.
Government Decision: Keeping in view the need to increase the area and production technology of the deprived/ neglected and nutritious cereal crops, more and more farmers will participate in the crop competition.
