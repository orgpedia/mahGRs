Under this scheme, insurance premium will be charged at a realistic rate and to reduce the burden of insurance premium on farmers, the insurance premium to be paid by farmers has been limited to 1.5 per cent for Rabi season and 5 per cent for cash crops.
Under this scheme, the risk level has been fixed at 70 percent for all crops.
The threshold yield of the notified crops in the notified area shall be determined by taking into account the risk level of the crop whose average yield of the last 7 years is multiplied by the average yield of the last 5 years.
7. Risk Factors: The scope of risks under the scheme has been widened to include the following.
7.1.Prevented Sowing/ Planting/ Germination of crops due to adverse climatic conditions.
7.2 Mid-season Adversity (7.3) Reduction in yield from sowing to harvesting due to natural fires, lightning, hailstorms, storms, cyclones, floods, inundation of fields, landslides, droughts, rain interruptions, pests and diseases, etc.
7.4 LOCALIZED CALMITTIES 7.5. Post-harvest losses due to natural causes. (Post Harvest Losses) 3.Your Crops and Farmers: Under this scheme, insurance cover will be provided to food crops, pulses crops and cash crops. This scheme will be implemented for the following 6 crops at the level of Revenue Board/ Mandal Group or Taluka notified by the Government for the Rabi 2019-20 season in the State.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Pick category      | Notified crops                                                                           |
| Cereals and pulses | Wheat (in the garden), Rabi sorghum (in the garden and in the field), gram, summer rice. |
| Wheat crops        | summer ground.                                                                           |
| Cash crops         | Onion.                                                                                   |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The summer rice crop has been notified for the notified area in the state, for which the threshold income and the average income of the current year have been determined by assuming rice.
4. Crop-wise insurance premium rate and insurance premium subsidy: Under this scheme, the insurance premium rate will be charged at a realistic rate. However, the rate of premium per hectare to be paid by all farmers for Rabi season is as follows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| A.A.              | crops                                                                   | Insurance premium to be paid by farmers                      |
| Crops and cereals | 1.5 per cent of the sum insured or the actual rate, whichever is lower. |
| 2                 | Cash crops (Onion)                                                      | 5% of the sum insured or the actual rate whichever is lower. |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Under this scheme, the difference between the crop-wise premium per hectare and the actual premium to be paid by the farmers will be considered as normal premium subsidy and this subsidy will be given equally by the central and state governments. The Central Government through the Agriculture Insurance Company of India (AIC) will pay the premium subsidy to the insurance companies.

The State Level Crop Insurance Coordination Committee has notified crop wise insurance sector components taking into account the average yield of the last 5 years of the highest yield of the last 7 years, area under the crop and the available manpower to carry out adequate crop harvesting experiments in the current season. In doing so, major crops in all the districts of the state have been included. The required number of crop cutting experiments have been planned as per the standard method of estimating yield for all the notified crops.
In addition, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana will be implemented on a pilot basis for the main crop at the Gram Panchayat level in the following districts of each revenue division of the state in the Rabi Season 2019-20. The details are as follows:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
| A.A. | the Revenue Department | the District | the main pick-up |

Also, 12 crop harvesting experiments are planned at the Revenue Board and Revenue Board block level in the current situation. Accordingly, while the Revenue Board or the Revenue Board is planning the crop harvesting experiment at the regional level at the block level, the District Collector of the concerned district is being given the freedom to plan the crop harvesting experiment at the gram panchayat level for at least 12 crops. The Collector should plan the crop cutting experiments for the notified crops in the notified area for crop insurance as per the prescribed method in accordance with the available resources, manpower at the local level. Crop insurance should be used to calculate the average productivity of all these crop harvesting experiments to determine the average productivity of the notified crop of the notified area.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, crop harvesting experiments are conducted using satellite images to obtain accurate and time-bound estimates of the yield obtained from crop harvesting experiments, and state-of-the-art techniques for crop yield estimation, e.g. The central government has suggested the use of drones (Dynamic Remotely Operated Navigation Equipment), smartphones, etc. Accordingly, pilot projects should be taken up at the State level by Central Research Institutions.
With a view to obtain accurate data in a transparent manner, it has been made mandatory to use the mobile app developed by the Central Government for crop harvesting experiments under this scheme. No other system/ app should be used for crop harvesting experiments. The selection of the plot should be done by the random method prescribed for crop harvesting experiment or by using remote sensing technique if possible. The location of the plot should not be disclosed until the harvest to avoid any moral hazard.
7.Form Protection: Under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, farmers will get insurance cover for losses due to unavoidable reasons.
7.1. Unsown/ Unsown Area due to Adverse Climatic Factors: Insurance cover shall be provided only for the notified major crops which have not been sown/ transplanted in the notified area on a large scale due to adverse conditions of insufficient rainfall, other climatic factors, if the sown/ un-sown area is more than 75% of the normal area.
7.2. Standing Crops from sowing to harvesting: Comprehensive insurance cover will be provided against loss of crop yield due to unavoidable risks such as drought, rainfall, flood, inundation of area, widespread infestation of pests and diseases, landslide, natural fire, lightning, storm, hailstorm and cyclone.
7.3 On Account Payment of Claims due to Mid-Season Adversity Insurance cover shall be provided in case of adverse weather conditions during the season, but not earlier than 15 days before the normal harvest, if the expected production of the farmers is expected to fall by more than 50% of the average production due to floods, rain interruptions, drought, etc.
7.4) Post-harvest losses: The crop which needs to be dried after harvesting by spreading or tying straw in the field, the damage caused by hailstorm, cyclone, cyclone and unseasonal rain within two weeks (14 days) after harvesting/ harvesting of the notified crop spread in the field for drying will be determined by conducting panchnama at individual level subject to the criteria.

GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: PROPEVIO-2019/ P.S. 146/11-A
Based on the representative suggestions, the concerned Collector should issue a notification regarding the payment of compensation for the notified insurance area for a particular crop and group of crops by meeting the necessary provisions for determining this risk.
The amount of damage and the compensation to be paid will be determined according to the joint inspection of the state government officials and the insurance company.
Farmers who have paid the insurance premium amount before the notification of the loss to be announced by the concerned Collector or the insurance premium amount has been deducted from their account will be eligible for this assistance. All the banks should ensure that the insurance premium of all the loanee farmers is deducted within 15 days after the sanction of crop loan in the case of loanee farmers and the same is applicable to all the loanee farmers. Otherwise, the concerned banks will be responsible for the compensation of the farmers who have been deprived of insurance coverage due to the fault of the banks.
The advance amount of compensation will be given up to a limit of 25% of the expected compensation amount and this assistance will be adjusted from the final compensation.
(6) If the adverse event occurs 15 days before the normal withdrawal time, this provision shall not apply and no compensation shall be payable.
7. The notified insurance sector component shall be taken into account for determining the compensation.

(3) The above provisions shall apply if the expected loss of the affected crop in the notified insurance area is more than 50% of the average yield.
4) Compensation formula: Threshold income- Expected income
Compensation amount Rs.- x Insurance covered amount X 25% Threshold Income
(e) Conditions: (1) In order to be eligible for this provision, farmers are required to participate in the scheme by paying the insurance premium, irrespective of the eligibility criteria such as sanction/ disbursement of loan to farmers before the notification in this regard.
2) After receiving the insurance premium subsidy (first installment) from the government, the insurance company will be compensated for this provision.
3) The farmers who are eligible for the above provisions will be compensated by the insurance company within 1 month after the report of the damage and notification is issued by the Collector.

GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: PROPEVIO-2019/ P.S. 146/11-A
Deposit insurance premiums with the respective banks within 7 days of the announcement.
The list of farmers along with the amount has to be sent to the concerned insurance company. However, this provision should only be used in exceptional circumstances.
10.3 Determination of Compensation Based on Average Yield at the End of the Season 1. The compensation to be determined under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana will be based on the average figure of income obtained from crop harvesting experiments in the insurance sector unit as determined by the Government. If the average yield per hectare of the insured crop in a given area falls below the threshold yield for that year, it is assumed that all the insured farmers in that area have suffered a loss.
The threshold yield or guaranteed yield of an insurance component shall be the average yield of the last 5 years out of the best of the previous 7 years in that season for all crops x the risk level. Under this scheme, a uniform risk level of 70 per cent has been fixed for all crops.
Threshold Income= 5 years average income best among the last 7 years of the season× 70% (Guaranteed Income) 3.
Average annual income- the average annual income for the year.
Insurance cover (Rs. It's per. (a) the threshold income
4. If the crop cutting experiment fails to cover the area under the crop as per the number prescribed in an insurance area component, the following action shall be taken.
In cases where there is not enough area under the crop, due to unfavourable climatic conditions/ infrastructure, adequate crop harvest may not be possible, the concerned insurance sector shall first assume the average income of the nearest equivalent insurance sector unit for the unit.
