Letter from Commissioner Animal Husbandry, Pune Poultry-2/ PR No.726/ CH Transfer/ 1121-22/2022, Pasai 13, Pune, Dy. 20.01.2022 2. Meeting of the Board of Directors of Maharashtra Livestock Development Board. Resolution No. 01.02.2022 passed. 83 (3)
The Proposal:
There are five centres in the state at Pune, Kolhapur, Nagpur and Aurangabad. At present, these areas are home to improved breeds of poultry birds like CARI, Kaveri, Gram Priya, Kadaknath, Giriraj, Vanraj etc.
Foundation stock is being maintained. Through this foundation, farm animals of rural areas are produced and distributed eggs of improved breeds of poultry birds, one-day-old chicks on a no profit no loss basis. At the same time, training on poultry farming is provided to the educated unemployed and farmers from time to time through these centers. This training is greatly benefiting the farmers, women and educated unemployed youth of the rural areas to set up businesses. It helps in rearing improved breeds of indigenous poultry and promotion and propagation of new improved breeds.
During the year 2020-21, due to the stress on the State's economy due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the budgeted funds could not be fully disbursed and the poultry birds could not be reared under the infrastructure flocks as per the capacity in all the above institutions. The bird house in Aurangabad has a total capacity of 4,500 birds and due to lack of funds, the basic flock here was sold. At present, the breeding of birds has been stopped. Duck Breeding Centre, Vadsa, Gadchiroli has a base flock of 350 ducks of Khaki Campbell breed with 50% of the original capacity.
Poultry feed payments are pending in the above areas due to lack of funds. Lack of timely availability of funds is creating difficulties in procuring poultry feed for the foundation herd as well as new chicks.

Government Decision No: Poultry-2022/ P.S. 13/ 4 or 4
A total of 58 posts of different cadres are working in four centralized egg hatchery centers and 6 in duck breeding center Vadsa, district Gadchiroli for managing these centers. The expenditure incurred on establishment and management of the areas is met from the mandatory expenditure of the State Government.
Due to the lockdown in March 2020 and the global corona pandemic, the state government has not released enough funds. Since all the central incubation centres were dealing with live birds, there was a big problem of food availability. As a solution to the lack of funds, the number of birds on the territory was reduced or the entire basic flock was sold.
Since these measures are not long-term but require continuous and timely supply of poultry feed and medicines, vaccination and timely availability of fresh feed and other essentials for each new batch of birds. Accordingly, there is a need to bring in autonomy in implementation to facilitate availability of funds at all times.
As per the constitution and by-laws of Maharashtra Livestock Development Board, the Board can look after all livestock related affairs, all poultry related matters of the Central Egg Harvesting Centre can also be taken care of in a practical manner. Similarly, since the Maharashtra Livestock Development Board is an autonomous body, immediate decisions will be taken in the meeting of the Board of Directors for funding activities so that food and other essentials for poultry birds can be made available immediately as detailed above.
Considering all the above, the government was considering transferring the permanent movable property of the four centralized egg-laying centers and duck breeding centers in the name of the Commissioner of Animal Husbandry, Pune to the Maharashtra Livestock Development Board. The government has taken the following decisions:
Government's decision:
The Central Egg Harvesting Center Pune, Kolhapur, Nagpur and Aurangabad and Duck Breeding Center, Vadsa G. Gadchiroli are five areas in the state, in which the government's approval is being given to transfer the permanent movable property to the Maharashtra Livestock Development Board with the sanctioned posts of officers/ employees in the name of Commissioner Animal Husbandry, Pune.
If the government is unable to provide funds in time for daily and essential activities related to the living birds in the area, such as bird feed, vaccines, medicines, purchase of birds/ eggs for the infrastructure herd, payment of electricity dues, then the Maharashtra Livestock Development Board should provide funds from its own resources. The Maharashtra Livestock Development Board should reimburse the amount spent from this fund after the government disburses the funds under the mandatory expenditure.

However, the expenditure on salaries and allowances of officers and employees of the said area and other incidental non-salary mandatory expenditure is not included in the index no. 24030472 should be paid from the funds received from the government on a regular basis. The area is currently receiving funds from the government under mandatory expenditure, which will be made available in the prevailing manner.
