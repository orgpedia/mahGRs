The Proposal:
in the state. The Maharashtra Animal Preservation (Amendment) Act, 1995 has come into force with effect from 4th March, 2015. Under this law, the slaughter of all bovine animals is prohibited. Hence, the slaughter of cows and calves, which are not useful for agriculture, for carrying ojis and for breeding, has been banned.

The approval was granted pursuant to a Government Resolution dated April 26, 2017. The Cabinet in its meeting held on 08.03.2019 has approved the implementation of the new revised scheme by scrapping the said scheme. Accordingly, an order was issued on March 8, 2019 to implement the scheme in the state.
In the said Government Resolution dated 08.03.2019, Paragraph 4 (2) states that this scheme is being implemented in 139 revenue sub-divisions of 34 districts in the financial year 2019-20.
However, the model code of conduct came into force in the state in September, 2019 in line with the general elections. President's rule was also imposed after the elections. Since then, the country has been under a lockdown from March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
