circular
Since certain aspects need to be fulfilled/ implemented/ done by the Commissioner (Agriculture) and the implementing agency for the effective implementation of the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, the following instructions are being issued in this regard: 1. As the data of cumulative crop harvesting experiments of Kharif and Rabi crops are not received by various district level agencies within the prescribed time frame, the insurance companies are not able to provide the crop productivity data for calculation of compensation within the prescribed time frame. Therefore, the accurate data of crop harvesting experiments should be submitted in the prescribed time frame as per the instructions given from time to time.
Grievance redressal committees constituted at various levels as per the guidelines and orders issued by the government should immediately dispose of the complaints received regarding Kharif and Rabi compensation and new insurance registration.
(3) In order to redress the grievances at the local level as per the provisions of the scheme, all the concerned insurance companies participating in the Kharif and Rabi seasons should ensure that their offices are opened at the district and taluka level and the appointed representative is regularly present in their offices.
Where the insurance company could not find a place to open the office due to some technical reasons, the representative of the insurance company in the office of the District/ Taluk Agriculture Officer should be provided a place for grievance redressal on a temporary basis.
Also, if the representative of the insurance company is not present at the district/ taluka level, the report should be submitted to the Commissionerate without delay.
4. Farmers and bank representatives should be advised to submit applications within the stipulated time frame without expecting last date/ extension as the last date for registration for Kharif and Rabi season is usually crowded with large number of applications.

5. Meetings with the representatives of all the banks should be held from time to time and appropriate instructions should be given to them regarding the submission of the loanee farmers to the insurance company within the stipulated time frame as per the provisions of the insurance scheme and in no case the bank will hesitate to implement the scheme.
Extensive awareness and extension programmes should be carried out at the local level and farmers should be encouraged to participate in the scheme by explaining the importance of the scheme. Workshops on crop insurance scheme should be organised at the district and taluk levels.
Since complaints are being received from banks and facilitation centres that the online applications of farmers are not being uploaded on the insurance company/ website within the stipulated time, every participating farmer should mention his/ her correct mobile number while submitting the insurance registration application and also challenge the farmers to ensure that their registered mobile number is accessed after their application is uploaded on the website by the facilitation centre/ bank.
8. Crop-wise sowing report for Kharif and Rabi season should be submitted in a regular and accurate manner as per the instructions given by the Government from time to time.
As per the guidelines of the scheme, regular meetings at the district level should be organized and notifications should be issued within the stipulated time frame in various situations such as sowing/ sowing/ not sowing, local disaster situation/ crop loss in the middle of the season, etc.
10. Crop harvesting training at district and taluka level should be done in a very strict manner. The crop harvesting experiment should be carried out jointly by the Revenue Department, Rural Development Department and Agriculture Department and all the concerned officers/ staff should be present for the training program.
Action should be taken as per the guidelines. The Collector should ensure that the crop harvesting experiment is completed within the stipulated time.
While planning the crop harvesting experiment for Kharif 2019 and subsequent seasons, the crop harvesting experiment should be planned by considering the factors such as Jirayat, Horticulture, etc. especially in the areas where there is low rainfall (Trigger-1) and the crop condition is fragile (Trigger-2-vegetation condition) as per the Drought Manual.
12.P.C. In respect of harvesting, a committee has been constituted for planning, training, implementation, control and collection as per the instructions of the Centre under the chairmanship of the Resident Deputy Collector. The Collector should check whether it is functioning properly.
13.Every user should register in time to register their experiments on the mobile app.
The village committee, concerned farmers and insurance company representatives are invited to co-witness the experiment.
