The Proposal:
As per the Maharashtra Agricultural University Act, 1983, a state level body" Maharashtra Council of Agricultural Education and Research, Pune" has been constituted by the state government in 1984 to effectively coordinate the activities of all agricultural universities in the state, especially those related to education, research, extension education and other matters of common interest. The Maharashtra Council of Agricultural Education and Research, Pune and the four agricultural universities in the state do not have the right to draw and disburse their own salary allowances, contingency expenses payments, medical payments and provident fund.

Therefore, it is under reference to the Director General, Maharashtra Council of Agricultural Education and Research, Pune to declare the Controller and Drawing and Disbursing Authority for the Council of Agriculture, Pune and the four Agricultural Universities in the State.
Accordingly, it was under the consideration of the government to declare Controlling Officer and Drawing and Disbursing Officer for Maharashtra Council of Agricultural Education and Research, Pune and four agricultural universities in the state.
Government's decision:
The Maharashtra Council of Agricultural Education and Research, Pune and all the four agricultural universities in the state have been given the demand No. D-3 Account Head- 2415 for the head of accounts relating to Agricultural Universities and Councils of Agriculture is being declared as Controller and Drawing and Disbursing Officer as mentioned in the table below
