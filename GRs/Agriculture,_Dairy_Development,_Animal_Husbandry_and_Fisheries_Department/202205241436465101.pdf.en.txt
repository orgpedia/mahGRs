Read:- 1) Letter from the Commissioner, Dairying No.Aduvi-18/ A.S.A./ 2022-23/2041, Dy. Letter dated 12/04/2022
Preamble: Under the 27 Small Constructions Objective, budgetary allocation is made for the offices of Worli Dairy, Aarey Colony and Dairy Project Dapchari under the Commissioner, Dairy Development. For this purpose, the officers of the Engineering Service, who are to be appointed by the Public Works Department instead of the original officers of the Dairy Department, have been declared as" Drawing and Disbursing Officers."
It has been observed that the works of the Public Works Department under the office of Worli Dairy, Aarey Colony and Dairy Project Dapchari are being undertaken in excess of the funds available under this objective. This has led to a lot of responsibility. Against this backdrop, the government was considering declaring officials working at the parent establishment of the Dairy Development Department as" Drawing and Disbursing Officers" instead of those appointed by the Public Works Department.
GOVERNMENT DECISION: In the above background, it is being approved to declare the original officers of the Dairy Department as" Drawing and Disbursing Officers" instead of the officers of the Engineering Service to be appointed by the Public Works Department for the purpose of disbursing funds to the offices of Worli Dairy, Aarey Colony and Dairy Project Dapchari under 27-Small Construction:
