Date: July 20, 2023
Reference: 1) Crop Competition Manual, January, 2002. Crop Competition-2022/ S.No. 113/4 J, Dy. 06th December, 2022 3) Letter from the Commissioner of Agriculture vide No. 6th June, 2023
Introduction: In order to increase the productivity of crops in the state, various yogas are performed by farmers in different parts and productivity is increased. By encouraging and honing the productivity of such experimental farmers, their willpower, morale are increased and new advanced technologies are used with more enthusiasm. This will help in increasing the income of farmers. Also, the scheme of inter-state crop competition is being implemented with the aim that other farmers of the area get guidance and add value to the total production of the state.
At present, in this scheme, the farmer can get the highest award at the state level.
The same crop has to be grown continuously for three years in their own fields, the productivity has to be maintained, unfortunately, in the event of untimely emergency/ natural calamity like situation, the decrease in productivity can be disastrous for the farmers.
To avoid this, the previous system is being changed so that farmers can participate and compete on the productivity of that crop in a single year. Henceforth, the competition should be held at the taluk, district and state level and not at the state level. Such demands are being made at the local level. For this purpose, the matter of changing the procedure before the crop competition was under the consideration of the government.
Considering the proposal submitted by the Commissionerate of Agriculture in this regard to revise the guidelines for crop competition, the earlier decision regarding crop competition was taken keeping in view the need to reconstitute the committees, eligibility criteria, number of winners, format, prescribe schedule for crop competitions and change the criteria prescribed for crop competition at different levels in accordance with the time. The Government decision dated 6 th December, 2022, to modify the criteria for crop competition from the Kharif season 2023 onwards was under consideration of the Government.
Government Decision: Considering the need to increase the area and production technology of the deprived/ neglected and nutritious cereal crops and with a view to ensure that more and more farmers participate in the crop competition, the norms for crop competition were discussed in the meeting. The Government has decided to amend the following Crop Competition Norms by amending the Government Decision dated 06.12.2022.
