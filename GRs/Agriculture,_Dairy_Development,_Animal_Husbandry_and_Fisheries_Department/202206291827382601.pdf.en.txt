Agriculture and Padum Department Government Resolution No. 0619/ No. 164/14-OD. 18.11.2021
Proposal of the Commissioner (Agriculture), State of Maharashtra No. Mridsa/ Mrida-6/ Co. B/ 11210/2022 D. 23.03.2022
The Proposal:
About 82% of the state's agriculture is rain-fed. Uneven distribution of rainfall in different parts of the state and dry spells are major natural problems. In such a period, due to lack of irrigation facilities, the production of crops is greatly reduced or if there is too much water stress, the crops are also destroyed and the farmer has to face financial loss. The solution is to promote the creation of farm pond infrastructure on the farm to store the water flowing through streams, rivulets, rivers, etc., or to draw water from other irrigation facilities such as ponds, wells, bore wells, etc., whenever there is heavy rainfall.
There is no scheme of the government with substantial financial provisions to help farmers finance digging of fields, therefore, the budget of the Maharashtra government for 2022-23 is presented in the Assembly. In his budget speech, the Deputy Chief Minister (Finance) said," The Chief Minister Sustainable Agriculture Irrigation Scheme will be expanded to include farm ponds and the subsidy amount for farm ponds will be increased by 50 percent to Rs. 75 lakh," he said. Accordingly, the Chief Minister proposed to increase the subsidy for farm ponds by 50% by including individual farm ponds in the Sustainable Agriculture Irrigation Scheme. The Cabinet in its meeting held on 06.06.2022 has approved and the matter of issuance of Government Resolution in this regard was under consideration of the Government, accordingly, the Government is taking the following decisions.
