Limits on consumption, higher production costs, inadequate irrigation facilities, mainly on rainfall
Dependent agriculture, different climatic conditions in different regions, as well as storage and processing
and lack of access to markets, lack of accurate agro-climatic advisories, as well as, for agriculture
Due to the low availability of credit, farmers are able to make long-term investments.
The limitations present are the major challenges faced by agriculture in Maharashtra. In addition, the crops
Production includes the total rainfall, the amount of rainfall, the incidence and distribution of pests and diseases, etc.
The factors also lead to a large number of fluctuations. As a result, the agricultural growth rate is also high.
There are ups and downs. Measures to maintain this growth rate
It needs to be done. To overcome these challenges and increase the income of farmers.

Also, the crop density improved, the area under the crop increased twice. Rainy section
Or there was a reduction in the impact on crops that received excessive rainfall. For this, a wide varamba-sari method is used.
There was an increase of 20-25% in the area sown. 60-70% Water due to micro-irrigation and water conservation
And it saves energy. With the construction of about 11,120 farm ponds, the water storage capacity has been increased.
Also, the adoption of climate-resilient farming practices has led to savings in labour costs.
Agro-produce as well as silk industry, seed production in shednets, fisheries, processing.
