Reference: 1. Department of Agriculture and Padum, Government Resolution No. 716/ No. 82/ Government Room, Dy. 17.01.2018 2. Department of Finance Government Decision No. 51/20/ Koshasra-5, D. 13.3.2020.

The Proposal:
The World Bank assisted Nanaji Deshmukh Krishi Sanjeevani Project (PoCRA) is being implemented in 5142 villages of 15 districts of the state since 2017-18.
The project covers 8 districts of Marathwada and 6 districts of Vidarbha and Jalgaon district which are affected by farmer suicides. Under this project, efforts are being made to develop climate-resilient farming methods to deal with the adverse effects of climate change on agriculture. For this purpose, various activities are being undertaken under the project, including providing financial assistance to farmers and Farmer Producer Organizations/ Groups for various agriculture related activities (farm machinery and implements, orchard plantation, micro irrigation irrigation, irrigation kits, farm ponds, processing plants etc.). The Maha-DBT portal of the state government was not developed when Nanaji Deshmukh started implementing the Krishi Sanjeevani project. Therefore, to facilitate the farmers to avail the benefits of various aspects of the project, for all stages from applying to receiving the direct subsidy, the project has developed an online DBT system with the help of Kotak Mahindra Bank in lieu of opening the bank account of the project with them, through which the subsidy is being transferred directly to the farmers' bank account for the last 2 years.
As per the Government decision dated 13.3.2020 referred to the Department of Finance, it has been decided to close the accounts opened for depositing funds of any government schemes in private or co-operative sector banks from 1.4.2020 and open the accounts only in nationalized banks.

GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: NADECR 4618/ PR No. 50/8-A
At present, work has been undertaken to develop/ integrate a system for implementation of Nanaji Deshmukh Krishi Sanjeevani Project through Maha-DBT portal but it will take some time for the system to be ready and fully operational.
At present, opening an account with a nationalised bank of the project will disable the online DBT system being operated by Kotak Mahindra Bank. Therefore, till the time a separate system is developed for Nanaji Deshmukh Krishi Sanjeevani Project on Maha-DBT portal, the government was considering to exempt the continuation of the bank account opened for the project in Kotak Mahindra Bank so that there is no interruption in the implementation of the project and problems do not arise in the distribution of subsidy to the farmers. The government has taken the following decisions:
Government's decision:
In order to ensure that there is no interruption in the implementation of the project and difficulties in the disbursement of subsidy to the farmers till the DBT system is developed/ integrated for Nanaji Deshmukh Krishi Sanjeevani Project through Maha-DBT portal, it is being approved to exempt the bank account opened in Kotak Mahindra Bank of the project from the relevant Government Decision dated 13.3.2020 of the Department of Finance.
This Government Resolution is being issued as per the concurrence received under the Informal Reference No. 191/20/ Co. P.-5, dated 28.8.2020 of the Department of Finance.
