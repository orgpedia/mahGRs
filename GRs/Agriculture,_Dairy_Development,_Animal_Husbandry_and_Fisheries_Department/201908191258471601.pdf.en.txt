The Proposal:
About 55% of the population depends on agriculture for their livelihood. About 80% of the total 225 lakh hectares area under crops in the state is dryland and the productivity of crops in this area fluctuates continuously due to the vagaries of rainfall. As a result, with a view to stabilize the income of farmers by ensuring continuous rain in dry areas and proper planning of available local resources, the government has decided to implement the" Dry Farming Campaign" scheme in the state to stabilize dry farming. 1 The decision has been approved. The scheme covers human resource development, protected irrigation facilities, mechanization, demonstration of improved varieties of dryland crops, soil testing, protected/ controlled cultivation, primary agricultural practices and marketing.
However, the various components to be implemented under the scheme include the existing National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture, Rainfed Area Development Programme, Agriculture Mechanization Sub Mission, Integrated Horticulture Development Mission, Agriculture Extension and Training Programme, etc.
It is a centrally sponsored scheme. Besides, the State Government has also Chief Minister

Food Processing Schemes, Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyaan, Farm Farms, Minor Irrigation Development Programmes, etc.
Plans have been made. These schemes also include the items under the scheme under the Dryland Agriculture Mission.
Also, the proposed works in all the villages selected earlier under the dryland farming campaign have been completed. Therefore, in the year 2019-20, again, with the aim of providing sustainable irrigation to the farmers in the drought prone areas without selecting new villages, the government was considering to implement the" Mukhyamantri Saswat Krishi Sinchayee Yojana" by restructuring the Dry Farming Mission in the drought prone areas as well as in the suicide affected and Naxal affected districts.
Government Decision: (a) 1. Subject to the provisions of Sec. The Government has approved the implementation of the scheme of Dry Farming Mission as per the decision taken on 12th March, 2014 and administrative approval is being given for the implementation of Mukhyamantri Saswat Krishi Sinchayee Yojana for the farmers of the suicide affected districts and the districts declared as Naxalite affected by the Central Government from time to time.
2. Approval is being given to implement the" Mukhyamantri Saswat Krishi Sinchayee Yojana" in 149 taluks declared as drought prone and 14 suicide affected districts of Amravati and Aurangabad revenue divisions and Wardha in Nagpur division and Chandrapur, Gondia and Gadchiroli districts declared as Naxal affected by the Central Government.
The scheme will be implemented from 2019-20.
The form of the plan:
Under this scheme, subsidy will be provided to the farmers in the areas mentioned in the above paragraph 2 to the maximum extent for the following:
