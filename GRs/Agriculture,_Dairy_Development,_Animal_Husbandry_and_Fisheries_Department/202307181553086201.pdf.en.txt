Background: The post-bifurcation Thane district remained predominantly an urban area as most of the rural areas of all the tribal-dominated taluks of Thane district were included in the newly created Palghar district. Therefore, as there is no need to keep the posts under the ATMA scheme for the Thane headquarters, the transfer of the posts ensured under the ATMA scheme for the Thane headquarters to the newly created Palghar district has been decided. 1 was communicated to the Commissioner (Agriculture).
(2) The Commissioner (Agriculture), As per the order, the sanctioned posts, including Project Director (ATMA) District Thane, have been transferred to Palghar district and Palghar will be the headquarters of the ATMA scheme for Thane and Palghar districts. Accordingly, the work of the Aatma system in the above two districts is being handled by the office of the Project Director (Aatma), Palghar. Therefore, the officials of the Thane district's Aatma system have to frequently go to the office of the Project Director (Aatma) Palghar from Thane district for work.
In view of the above administrative difficulties, the matter of declaring the District Superintendent Agriculture Officer, Thane as Project Director (Atma) Thane was under consideration of the Government.
Government's decision:
District Superintendent Agriculture Officer, Thane is being declared as Ex-officio Project Director (ATMA), Thane for Thane district. Accordingly, along with the officers/ employees of the Thane district's Atma system, the smart room and its officers will remain in Thane.
