Karad, G. Satara, 3) Lonere, Ta. There is scope for establishing nurseries as irrigation facilities are available in the area of Mangaon, G. Raigarh. If the nursery is established, the requirement of saplings under the Bhausaheb Phundkar Fruit Garden Plantation Scheme and Maharashtra Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme will be met. If a nursery is established, no separate posts will have to be created for that nursery. It will not affect any sectoral component and will not be a financial burden. If nurseries are established on these areas, the area of orchard cultivation will be greatly increased by making available grafts/ saplings to the farmers of the area. This will help raise farmers" income. The area will benefit financially from the sale of saplings/ plants. As a result, local farmers in the surrounding areas will get a large number of employment opportunities, considering this, the matter of giving approval to set up a fruit orchard was under the consideration of the government.
