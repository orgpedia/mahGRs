Direction
Dairy farming is an important link between agriculture and industry. For this, the dairy sector needs to be strengthened. Dairy farming in the state is managed at three levels- Primary Milk Society, Taluka Milk Society/ Union and District Milk Union. There is a need for financial coordination between the members of the milk cooperative societies/ associations and the milk producers to ensure that the business is sustainable.
Since the ripening period for milk is from October to March, milk production increases during this period. It is observed that in order to control their business as milk production is increasing, the institutions/ associations are reducing the milk procurement rates. In such a situation, the members of the organization/ union as well as the milk producers have to face financial loss.
Since April-September is the lean season for milk production, the production of milk during this period is less as compared to the production of milk during the lean season. In the absence of milk shortage, milk cooperative societies/ associations procure milk from their milk producer members by paying higher milk procurement price to keep their business stable. Organizations/ associations and their members get financial benefit from the milk being available at a reasonable price.
As part of the measures to ensure that the milk producers do not have to sell milk to the cooperative milk societies/ unions at a lower price during the lean period, the Government has issued Government Directive No. MLK 2015/ Q.No.72/ Padum 8, D. The Cooperative Milk Societies/ Unions in the State have been mandated to pay the same milk procurement price to the milk producing farmers from the date of the Government decision issued from time to time, considering the milk procurement rate fixed by the Government as the standard rate.
Therefore, the government needs to take measures to maintain consistency in milk procurement rates besides the above direction so that the milk producers are able to pay the fixed milk procurement rates to the cooperative milk societies/ unions and balance the business.
Accordingly, the Government vide Section 79A of the Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act, 1960, directs as under:

Government Resolution No: MLK 2018/ PR No.72/ Padum 8
In order to enable the cooperative societies/ unions and members to recover the financial loss during the procurement period of milk from the additional finance received during the procurement period and to ensure stability in the procurement price of milk in the dairy sector, the cooperative milk societies/ unions and milk members should deposit a reasonable amount per litre each in a separate bank account as" Milk Price Stabilisation/ Fluctuation Fund" and utilise the same to recover the financial loss during the procurement period. If it is found that no such action has been taken, it will be deemed to be a violation of the provisions of the above Act.
