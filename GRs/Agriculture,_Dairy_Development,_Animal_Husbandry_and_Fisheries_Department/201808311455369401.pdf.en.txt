The Proposal:
It is the policy of the Government to discontinue two or more schemes launched for a limited period for the same purpose in the State, schemes whose duration has expired, and schemes which are being misused at the district or State level. Similarly, the policy of the Government is to reduce the number of schemes in the State by merging the schemes with similar objectives implemented by the State Government and incorporating them in other schemes.
The state government had declared 14 districts in Vidarbha and Marathwada as affected by farmer suicides due to crop failure, debt burden and other reasons. In the wake of increasing farmer suicides in Yavatmal and Osmanabad districts, the Prime Minister said that the Government is committed to the development of agriculture through comprehensive agricultural development and convergence of existing schemes. The Government had approved the implementation of the Motiramji Lahane Krishi Samriddhi Pariyojana during the period 2016-2017 to 2018-19 vide Government Resolution dated 04.06.2016. In addition, the state government had taken up the Nanaji Deshmukh Krishi Sanjeevani Project with the help of the World Bank to overcome the problems of farmers in 14 districts affected by farmers' suicides and to ensure that the farmers were not stressed due to declining income and were restored to their previous condition from time to time.
The government plans to implement the project in Jalgaon district, including 14 districts affected by farmer suicides in Vidarbha and Marathwada, from 2018 to 2024.
