GOVERNMENT CLEARING: Considering the increasing participation of private and cooperative sector in dairy farming, the government has a policy to reduce the government's involvement in it. Due to this, the amount of milk collection at many government milk schemes and government milk processing centers in the state has reduced significantly. Considering the scope of the cooperative sector while reducing the participation of the government in this sector, the policy decision to transfer the land/ machinery of the government milk scheme to the cooperative milk center on a temporary or permanent basis has been taken in the context of No. 1 here. The decision was taken on 11/11/2002. As per the provisions of this Government decision, the price/ rent rate of the dairy or cold storage units which are ready to be transferred to the permanent cooperative societies on a buy-sell basis as well as to accommodate the employees working in the respective societies at the time of transfer on lease is exempted.
As on 11/11/2002, a large number of manpower was engaged at the concerned Government Milk Scheme/ Refrigeration Centre at the time of decision making. Therefore, there was scope for transfer of manpower to reduce the financial burden on the government. However, at present, there is another class-4 employee working in many milk centers. (For maintenance of machinery) So there is no scope for transfer of staff. In such a situation, there is a demand from the cooperative milk unions to transfer 50 percent of the employees to the government milk scheme/ cold storage centers.
As explained above, many Government Milk Schemes/ Refrigeration Centres are not in a position to transfer staff as there are no employees working in them. In such a situation, the condition of transferring the above 50 percent employees is absent or the provision can be taken advantage of.
Hence, the order should be quashed. The government has taken the decision. The following amendments to the provisions of 11/11/2002 are being approved:
Rule 6. (1) (a) reads," The lease rent shall be 1% of the value of the property including the book value of building, machinery etc. and the market value of the land in the dairy or cold storage unit."

instead of
The lease rent will be 10 per cent of the market value of the building, machinery etc. and the market value of the land at the dairy or cold storage centre.
2. Rule 7. (b) says," The value of land shall be 50 per cent of the market value. " Instead
" The price of land will be as per the market rate. " Apart from the above changes, the other provisions affecting the said amendments shall stand automatically repealed.
