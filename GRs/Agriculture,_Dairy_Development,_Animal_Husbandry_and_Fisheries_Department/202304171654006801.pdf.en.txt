Introduction: The Department of Agriculture implements externally aided projects, various Central and State sponsored schemes. The Centrally Sponsored Schemes receive funds from the Central Government in a phased manner during the year after the finalization of the Annual Action Plan. Similarly, for state sponsored schemes, funds are also received from the Finance Department in a phased manner. Though the agriculture department receives funds in a phased manner, the activities of the agriculture sector are carried out seasonally. Also, about 75% of the area under Kharif and Rabi crops is covered in the Kharif season itself. Therefore, the Kharif season is very important for the economy and farmers of the state. Therefore, for implementation of various schemes under Kharif crops during pre-Kharif and post- Kharif seasons, Reference No. A standing order has been issued under Section 1.
The Department of Planning No. 2. To expedite the implementation of Government schemes by making them people-oriented, all the administrative departments have been asked to review the Central and State Government schemes being implemented by the department and decide the district-wise targets of the schemes to be implemented under this initiative and to issue self-explanatory instructions to the field officers regarding the action to be taken to achieve the set targets.
In this background, the Government is issuing a circular to implement the campaign" Fair Government Schemes for the Development of All Common People" through the Agriculture Department so that the farmers can be provided timely financial assistance through various schemes of the Agriculture Department for the purchase of their agricultural inputs and the construction of agricultural infrastructure before the Kharif season.
