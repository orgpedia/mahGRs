Read:- 1) Department of Agriculture and Padum, Government Decision No. Fig. 1208/ Q. No. 72/15-A, D. 22/05/2009.
Letter from the Commissioner (Agriculture) No. KRIYA-2021/ UBIC/ Reorganization/ Akola/ 16498/ MBW/ 2021, Dy. 24/05/2021
Introduction: Refer No. The structure of the Department of Agriculture has been determined according to the government decision of 1. According to this diagram, the office of the Sub-Divisional Agriculture Officer for the offices of the Taluk Agriculture Officer, Patur and Balapur is located at Akot. Taluk Agriculture Officer, farmers of Balapur and Patur have to go to Akot subdivision for agricultural work. Balapur taluka is 70 km from Akot and Patur taluka is 80 km from Akot. It is inconvenient for the farmers.
Also, considering the villages of both the taluks, the Akot Sub-Divisional Office is very far away for the majority of the farmers, so it is not affordable to the farmers from the point of view of communication and from the financial point of view, it is very inconvenient. As a result farmers are facing problems. From Akola, Balapur taluka is 30 km and Patur taluka 26 km. I.
is far away. As Akola is close to the farmers of Balapur and Patur taluka, farmers often come to Akola city. Therefore, the proposal to connect these two taluks with Akola subdivision was under the consideration of the government.
Government Decision: Under the decision of the present Government, it is being approved to reorganize the offices of Taluk Agriculture Officer, Balapur and Patur in Akola district as follows: After the re-organization of the sub-divisions of Akola district, the following taluks and mandals will be included under the Akola and Akot sub-divisional offices.
