In the meeting held on 7/3/2018 and the State Level Steering Committee of CropSap Scheme, Shri.
In the meeting held on 11/04/2018, it was decided to implement the Integrated Crop Sap Scheme for the management of pest diseases on major fruit crops and other crops in the state and the matter of granting administrative approval to the revised Crop Sap Scheme was under consideration of the government. Under the project, it was proposed to issue revised instructions to the farmers to conduct strict and regular examination of pests and diseases at various stages of the crop, receive guidance and advice from experts in this regard and guide them in a time-bound manner. Following is the government's decision:
Government's decision:
The Integrated Pest-Disease Surveillance and Advisory Plan (CropSAP) scheme for management of pests and diseases in major crops like Soyabean, Cotton, Paddy, Tur, Gram, Mango, Pomegranate, Banana, Tamarind, Orange and Chikku is being approved from 2018-19. In 2018-19, administrative approval is being given for a programme with a budget of Rs. 4147.08 lakh (Rs.
The following guidelines are being prescribed for the implementation of the Pest and Disease Surveillance and Counselling Scheme in 2018:
1) The main crops to be covered under the CropSap scheme are soyabean, cotton, rice, tur, gram and major fruits like mango, pomegranate, banana, guava, orange and chikoo.
2) The CropSap scheme for soybean, cotton, paddy, tur and gram should be implemented with the participation of field staff of the Agriculture Department and for this mobile application and computer system developed by the National Informatics Centre, Pune should be used.
3) In the computer system developed for this scheme, agricultural assistants and agricultural supervisors should be registered as scouts and the Mandal Agriculture Officer, Taluk Agriculture Officer, Sub-Divisional Agriculture Officer and District Superintending Agriculture Officer should be registered as supervisory officers for their subordinate areas and they should be given the responsibility of conducting random pest and disease surveys.

4) Information on pest and disease survey should be made available to the Commissioner (Agriculture) for the initial period of Kharif season by computer operators and other essential human resources through the National Informatics Centre as per requirement to overcome the difficulties in filling the information on the online website through mobile. Also, with their help, the staff of the agriculture department should be trained to fill the information.
The Director (Horticulture) should develop a mobile application and computer system for fruit crops under the revised CropSap scheme with the help of National Informatics Centre, Pune in the next six months and use the computer system developed for the HortSap project by National Centre for Integrated Pest Management Research, New Delhi for survey and reporting.
6) To provide accurate information about the pest and disease survey for the crops included in the scheme and to manage it online through computer system, agricultural assistants and agricultural supervisors as well as supervisory officers registered in the system
Complete training on computer systems should be completed before the Kharif season begins.
(7) A State Level Steering Committee (Agriculture) is being constituted at the State level under the Chairmanship of the Commissioner for planning and control of the scheme and its composition is mentioned in Annexure-A.
8) Under the CropSap scheme, farmers should be advised through mobile app and SMS about the management of major pests and diseases on crops.
9) In order to ensure the participation of farmers under this scheme, the farmers should be provided with the facility of submitting (uploading) photos or information about pests and diseases in their fields to the Department of Agriculture through computer system or mobile app.
For this purpose, first of all, after receiving a request from the mobile number of the concerned farmer to get advice on the outbreak of pest disease on the crop, after determining the identity of the farmer through OTP (One Time Password), the farmer should take further action by receiving information about the outbreak of the crop and receiving advice and guidance from the experts. For this, it should be ensured that the necessary provisions are made in the proposed computer system.

Government Resolution No: KIRONI-1418/ PR No. 55/4 A
The Agricultural Assistant and the Agricultural Supervisor will be responsible for conducting separate meetings, meetings and demonstrations for providing necessary advice to the farmers at the village and taluka level of the concerned crop area through mobile SMS immediately after receiving guidance and advice from the experts through the system in a strictly regular manner, before the rate of pests and diseases reaches the economic loss level or near the economic loss level (during the yellow phase). Accordingly, it will be the responsibility of the Mandal Agriculture Officer and the Taluk Agriculture Officer to ensure that the proceedings at the village level are carried out regularly. It will be mandatory for the sub-divisional agricultural officers to review this at the divisional level every fortnight.
11) The District Superintending Agriculture Officer and the Divisional Joint Director of Agriculture should review the action taken as above. Also, the directions and advice of the concerned experts should be made available through the system within two days on a regular basis by taking a free record of the matters received by the agricultural universities for guidance and advice on pests and diseases on the crop. This will also need to be reviewed by the heads of departments at the university level.
12) The complaints/ information raised by the farmers and field staff regarding the pest and disease outbreak on the crop on this system, the advice given by the experts accordingly and the detailed details of the various remedial schemes taken by the Taluk Agriculture Officer, Circle Agriculture Officer, Agriculture Supervisor and Agriculture Assistant will be made available on the project website in the open for the information of all concerned.
13) It will be mandatory to make available a separate updated list of villages which have reached the economic loss level (ETL) or are near the economic loss level (when in the yellow phase) before the pest disease reaches the economic loss level (ETL) on the project website in an open format for the information of all concerned.
At the level of Commissioner of Agriculture, the Director (Horticulture) will supervise the planning of fruit crops and the Director (Extension and Training) of other major crops will supervise.

3. Sanderi Bonded Weed Management: In the Kharif season of 2017, there was a large outbreak of Sanderi Bonded Weed on the cotton crop. In order to avoid its repetition in 2018, the State Level Steering Committee of the CropSap Scheme, as decided in its meeting on 2018/04/11, should strictly follow the instructions mentioned in paragraph 2 above regarding management of Shendri Bondi weeds. To this end, the Administration has approved the provision of funds from the funds of the Action Plan referred to in paragraph 1 above for the following:
A. Farmers Training: One day training should be organized for the cotton farmers of 545 mandals of the cotton growing districts and those who will submit information to the government about the pest and disease outbreak by installing pheromane traps at their own cost for the management of Atma Nirbhar Kisan Mitra Shendri Bond. These farmers should be registered on the computer system through OTP. In this way, 100 farmers should be selected per circle. In this training class, farmers should be trained by expert trainers of the agriculture department, scientists of the agricultural university and the agricultural science center.
B. Survey: Under the regular CropSap scheme, the field officers/ staff of the Agriculture Department should carry out the survey work through pheromone traps for other crops including Shendri Bondi weed on cotton crop.
The Taluka Agriculture Officer should purchase the pheromane traps and lures through the Maharashtra Kashi Udyog Vikas Nigam for surveying and inspecting the crops at various critical stages in the village assigned to the agricultural assistants and agricultural supervisors working under the project. to each of the farmers and

Government Resolution No: KIRONI-1418/ PR No. 55/4 A
Considering the number of pheromone traps required for the crop area assigned to the supervisor, the total number of pheromone traps required for the taluk should be reported to the Maharashtra Agro Industrial Development Corporation and the corporation should accordingly make adequate availability of pheromone traps to their distributor. The detailed record of the pheromane trap purchased in this way should be taken in the repository register and its immediate use should be done by the concerned to prevent the possible pest and disease outbreak on the assigned crop area.
The progressive farmers of the village/ farmer friends under ATMA should be encouraged to submit the information regarding pest and disease outbreak on computer system by conducting survey through pheromane traps at their own cost for at least 10% of the average sown area of the cotton crop.
For this, they should be given appropriate support for local availability of pheromane traps. The farmers of Shendri Bond Alli in the area will themselves conduct a survey and get information on the system.
They will present and take necessary measures according to the advice of experts in the outbreak of pests.
Mass trapping under Integrated Management System (IM): Mass trapping of cotton bollworms in 20 cotton growing districts with a maximum area of 100 hectare per village in 204 villages at 100% subsidy will help in stopping the further life cycle of the pest. It is to be planned by the District Superintendent Agriculture Officer and implemented by the Agriculture Assistant and Agriculture Supervisor. Under this experiment, 20 pheromone traps should be set up per hectare and 1.50 lakh eggs per hectare of parasitic insects like Trichogramma bacteria should be broadcast twice. A total of 15 Trico cards per hectare should be made available to the farmers.
Emergency Tenders: In case of outbreak of Shanderi Bonded Locust, immediate measures will be taken in villages above the level of economic loss and farmers will be provided with biological/ chemical pesticide tenders worth Rs. 750/- per hectare or 50% subsidy subject to a ceiling of 2 hectares. In addition, if necessary, the Commissioner (Agriculture) should submit a separate proposal to the government from time to time. These emergency tenders should be used for management of pest diseases in cotton crops as well as soybean, paddy, tur and gram crops. The pesticide will be supplied through Maharashtra Insecticides Limited (MIL), a subsidiary of Maharashtra Agro Industries Development Corporation (MAIDC). 2.50% of average sown area of cotton crop (1 page 6 of 11)

Government Resolution No: KIRONI-1418/ PR No. 55/4 A
The funds to be made available for pesticide inputs should be utilised for a total area of 1.07 lakh hectares (lakh hectares) and 7,000 hectares of other crops. District Superintending Agriculture Officers should register block-wise demand for pesticides recommended by the Central Insecticides Board and the Maharashtra Agro Industries Development Corporation should make available these pesticides at the taluk level or provide subsidy through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) scheme for the medicines purchased by the farmers themselves in the area limits of the district.
A. Pheromane traps by Maharashtra Agro Industries Development Corporation and Trichogramma Bacterial Parasitic Insects supplied by Agricultural Universities, Krishi Vigyan Kendras, Biological Pesticides Production Laboratories of Agriculture Department will be used for survey and demonstration under the project. Since subsidy is not paid to the farmers for these things, the entire fund for this should be paid to the concerned institution. Firstly, the demand for pheromone traps and lures to the Maharashtra Agro Industries Development Corporation should be registered jointly by the Agriculture Commissionerate. However, the Commissioner (Agriculture) shall ensure that the demand registered with the Corporation is properly utilised after the supply is made.
4. The Commissioner (Agriculture) has referred to the above mentioned matters in respect of the said Revised CropSap Scheme as well as the above Reference No. 9 The said Government Decision is being issued in pursuance of the proposal submitted to the Government under the letter herein and the detailed necessary guidelines in this regard should be issued to all concerned from the Commissionerate level without delay. The improved computer system of the scheme should be made operational immediately. The Commissioner (Agriculture) should ensure that this scheme is implemented in the form of a special campaign as it is very important from the point of view of increasing the maximum crop yield of the farmers at a low cost and increasing their income. Necessary steps should also be taken to publicise and publicise the scheme.
Since there is no provision for disbursement of funds on Budget Distribution System (BDS) for participating institutions other than Agriculture Department under the scheme, the funds allocated for them are being withdrawn at the level of Commissioner of Agriculture and transferred to their bank accounts through RTGS and the funds allocated to these participating institutions under CropSap Scheme in 2017-18 are being approved for spending at their level in 2018-19.
In the first phase, Rs. 10.50 crore has been allocated for the implementation of CropSap Scheme in 2018-19.
