Preamble The Goat/ Sheep group distribution, State level and District level schemes have been in operation since 2011-12 and while providing benefits to the beneficiaries under both the schemes, the benefits of goat-sheep and goat-male sheep are being provided as per the price basis prescribed in the relevant Government decisions. However, due to the increase in the prices of goats and sheep from time to time, there is a difficulty in providing goats and sheep at the rates prescribed in the government decision, and there is a frequent demand from the beneficiaries and public representatives to revise the rates under the said schemes. Accordingly, in order to bring uniformity between the State level scheme and the District level scheme, the Government was considering to increase the said price taking into consideration the prevailing market price of goats/ sheep excluding the sub-components of goat/ sheep shed, food and water utensils, health facilities and medical treatment in the schemes being implemented by the Government vide its decisions dated 02.07.2011 and 16.09.2011 respectively. Accordingly, as per the approval received in the Cabinet Meeting held on 12.5.2021, the following Government Decision is being issued.
Government Resolution 2. Reference No. The Government Decision dated 02.07.2011, Government Preamble dated 16.09.2011 and Government Decision dated 11.11.2011 are being superseded and the following revised schemes are being approved for implementation from 2021-22.
