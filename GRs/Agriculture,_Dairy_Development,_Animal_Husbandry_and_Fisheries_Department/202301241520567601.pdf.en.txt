Mantralaya, Mumbai- 400 032
Date: January 24, 2023
Read:- 1) Central Government's letter dated 17.06.2021 on Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana Guidelines
(2) Proposal No. Fish/ S/ 053101/
1002/2020-21, dated 16.03.2021
Preamble- To tackle the problem of malnutrition in the state, it is very important to increase the availability of protein rich fish feed. Fish is an important part of the protein diet.
The Fisheries Department of the State is striving to increase the availability of high quality protein content by increasing fish production in the State. At present, efforts are being made to increase the fish production by using the available area and resources to increase the marine fish production of the state, but there are some limitations in this, and the fish production by marine fishing has been stable for the last few years. However, in view of the growing population, it is necessary to increase the availability of high-protein fish feed, provide alternative means of livelihood to fishermen, etc., by increasing fish production through culture fisheries in the marine sector along with capture fisheries.
With a view to create a Blue Revolution in the State by enhancing fish production by using sustainable scientific methods for development in the fisheries sector, the Government of India has implemented the Blue Revolution Scheme from 2015-16 to 2019-20 and now the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana is being implemented for a period of five years from 2020-21 to 2024-25.
The scheme has been approved by the central government and state governments have also been asked to implement it.
The main objectives of Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana are to increase fish production, increase export value from fisheries, reduce post-harvest losses, increase the amount of fish in the per capita diet, double the income of fish farmers, create new jobs.

As per the guidelines of the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana, prior permission from the State Government or other competent authorities is required/ mandatory to implement the cage conservation scheme/ project in the sea. Allotment of area earmarked for conservation is for a period of at least 10 years
A clear condition of being on lease is mentioned in the guideline. The government was considering a policy for cage fish farming in the sea and the adjoining bay area in the 720 km coastal area of the state. The government has taken the following decisions:
Government Decision: The Department of Fisheries is granting permission for cage farming in the sea and adjoining bay area in the 720 km coastal area of Maharashtra. The project should be publicized through workshops, training classes, newspaper advertisements in the coastal districts of the state. The outline of the project for cage fish culture will be as follows.
Mariculture: A specialized branch of fisheries that involves the raising of fish for fish production and other products in enclosed areas of the sea, such as cages, pens, or in brackish tanks, ponds, or raceways. In this way, there is an opportunity to create sustainable alternative to fish production through conservation in the marine sector. It is also a means of introducing new skills and technologies and diversifying the fisheries sector in a sector that is largely traditional and somewhat stagnant in the economy. Mariculture can increase employment and income in areas with marginal economies and advanced coastal zone management objectives through improved marine resources, planning and management. The export of fish and fish products produced using the model system will provide a source of foreign exchange to the country. At present, less capital is required to do this business, which will provide an easy opportunity to the socio-economically weaker groups.
Open sea cage fish culture is one of the emerging modern technologies of intensive fish production in the marine conservation sector.
Since it is being considered as a major option to increase fish production, it is expanding rapidly in many parts of the world. The open sea cage fisheries in India are still in the early developing stage. It is located in Maharashtra.
There is an urgent need today to consider open sea cage fish culture as a commercial venture to increase fish production in a sustainable manner. On page 22, however,

Government Resolution No: Matsyavi- 1120/ PR No. 201/ Padum 14
The State of Maharashtra does not have any leasing policy for this new technology and it is necessary to formulate a policy for leasing out the water area required for cage fish conservation in this area i. e. in the sea.
Current Status of Marine Fisheries in Maharashtra The State of Maharashtra has a total coastline of 720 km. At the end of February 2021, there are 15010 licensed fishing boats operating in the coastal areas of the state, out of which 13485 are mechanical and 1525 are non-mechanical. As many as 173 fish landing centres have been announced along the state's coastline and there are 456 fishing villages along the state's coast. As per the Marine Fisheries Census 2010 conducted by the Central Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI), the total population of fishermen in the State is 3,86,259. There are 274 fishermen cooperatives in the state, including those in the mechanical and non-mechanical sectors. The total fish production of the State during 2018-19 was 4167 MT. In the marine fisheries sector, fishing is regulated under the Maharashtra Marine Fisheries Regulation Act 1981 in the marine catchment areas (up to 12 nautical miles) of the state.
Objectives of open sea cage fisheries policy.
In order to maximize the economic benefits to the State by maintaining the balance between fisheries and environment and to increase fish production, the Government has formulated a policy for leasing out marine areas with the following objectives:
To promote offshore marine fisheries that are compatible with the principles of conservation of natural resources without harming the environment.
2. To devise a new strategy for fish culture and its systematic management for sustainable fish production.
Increase the availability of fish protein per capita and double fish production in the next five years.
4) Using traditional methods as well as advanced technology.
To develop skills among the fishermen community and to strengthen the organisation of self-help groups, especially among women.
6.Encourage traditional fishermen to adopt cage culture in the offshore open sea areas so that they adopt the newly developing fish culture method instead of the traditional method of fishing and provide all necessary support to the fishermen in this regard.
Creation of gainful rural employment for the fishing community.
8. Generating substantial revenue for the State.

To regulate offshore marine fisheries for better and sustainable resource utilization for domestic and export market development.
attracting private sector investment.
To promote private-public investment in fisheries entrepreneurship and research activities for offshore marine fisheries activities so that the interests of the fishermen are coordinated for both the concerned fishing community and the State.
12. To ensure that the interests of other users of maritime waters are not affected.
Policy and procedure for leasing of water bodies for marine cage conservation- Leasing and leasing procedures/ Standard Operating Procedure (SOP).
3.1 PRINCIPLES Principles to be considered for formulating a policy for the conservation of fisheries in the open sea cage system.
• The division of the open sea water area is diversified with the characteristics of the open sea fishery region. GIS format partition plans will be prepared as and when required with the help of competent institutions/ research institutions.
Common property use conflicts will not be a hindrance/ impediment to navigation, fishing and other uses when the state allows for marine conservation such as cage fisheries in the open sea.
The holding capacity is limited to the biological production in the open sea and the State shall determine the limit in this regard after consulting with the competent agencies/ research institutions.
The leasing authority leasing policy and management will be entrusted to a single entity so that the objectives are established to the fullest extent.
The principle of environmental protection" polluters will compensate" will be applied to the open sea, so that environmental damage is minimized. Also pre-assessment environmental impact and post-assessment environmental impact (environmental impact assessment) can be requested.
• Conservation of aquatic ecosystems.
Page 22 of 4.
# Page 5
Government Resolution No: Matsyavi- 1120/ PR No. 201/ Padum 14
As the aquatic ecosystems are sensitive to changes due to human activities, conservation/ preservation of local aquatic biodiversity will be considered while undertaking marine conservation.
3.2 Classification- Division of marine waters for cage fisheries (Zonation)
Area for conservation of open sea/ cage fish A- Ecologically and strategically sensitive areas in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), active fishing zones, landing centres/ harbours, navigation routes, areas in the vicinity of these, defence establishments or other buildings or socially important facilities, industrial effluents, faeces, water pollution, heavy discharge of fresh water by rivers, dumping of explosives, sites where infrastructure such as underwater pipelines, telecom cables, etc., exist and where there are cracks (historical) Therefore, you should avoid this area when choosing a place.
(b) Area for conservation of open sea/ sea cage fish Area B Offshore marine fishery activities in the form of open sea/ sea cage fish farming are permitted in the area. This area will be further classified based on the distance from the coast.
The zonation and demarcation of marine area for marine conservation in the form of offshore marine fisheries purposes will be done in consultation with all concerned agencies and interested persons in the nature of experts and the information will be notified to the public and stakeholders.
Commissioner Fisheries, Maharashtra State, Mumbai will be the Chairman of the Committee and a State Level Expert Committee will be constituted under his Chairmanship. These committees will help in dividing the coastal/ marine area into different zones. Further, where cage culture is allowed in the offshore open sea, the committee will issue detailed Geographical Indication and a committee will be constituted at the district level under the chairmanship of Assistant Commissioner Fisheries to allocate space. Area proposed to be covered prior to commencement of fishing/ aquaculture activities-A or

3.3 Offshore Aquaculture Input Management 3.3.1) Place selection While undertaking marine/ marine cage fisheries, it shall be given utmost importance that the environment is not disturbed as per the nature of the place.
(a) Suitable sites for various marine conservation activities such as open sea cage culture, sea weed culture, bivalve culture, crab culture/ fattening, pen culture rearing, seed production/ hatchery and nursery shall be identified in consultation with competent agencies/ research institutions/ marine surveyors. The availability of space plays an important role in determining the economic viability of fisheries. such as the cost of cage construction, the availability of fish seed,
Page 22 of 6.
# Page 7
Government Resolution No: Matsyavi- 1120/ PR No. 201/ Padum 14
Marine cage space has a direct impact on fish mortality, production and overall profitability in fisheries.
b) The best water quality must be available in the selected area to avoid impractical conditions and achieve maximum growth of culturable or caged fish. Also, providing communication facilities for proper and safe installation of cages (setting up of sets), supply of fish boats required for cage culture, catch and marketing of fish. Before choosing a place for the conservation of cage fish, in addition to the quality of the water and fish in the place, information on the biological and natural classification of species suitable for conservation should also be known.
c) Change of location after multiple breeding at the same place should be made mandatory because- 1. Cage aquaculture may lead to spread of diseases, transmission of parasites and changes in aquatic flora and fauna.
2. Unabated use of antibiotics and their release into aquatic environment can lead to the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria.
Uneaten food, feces and other debris accumulate at the bottom of the cage, resulting in a decrease in dissolved oxygen and a lack of oxygen (hypoxia).
3.3.2. the conservation of species
3.3.2.1) species
The following criteria must be met when selecting species for fisheries/ conservation in the open sea cage system:
Acceptance/ preference of fish culture, marketing suitability (market value), high value species of commercial importance should be selected.
2. Choose a species that is easy to care for, easily adaptable to the cage environment, fast growing, as well as resistant to pests and diseases.
3. Select the species which have the ability to accept artificial feeding in a captive environment. Out-of-home food
(a) Natural foods. the fish, or
(b) Artificial foods. Pelletized feed 4. Cultivation of species banned by State/ Central Government.
Page 22 of 7.
# Page 8
Government Resolution No: Matsyavi-1120/ PR No.201/ Padum 14 3.3.2.2) Seeds of species
The quality of the seeds of the species is very important in cage culture.
2. Seeds will be required to be procured from the list prepared by the Fisheries Department of the approved Marine Seed Production Centre (Fish Hatcheries) in the country.
3. Preference should be given to seeds produced in Indian production centres which have screening systems for viral and bacterial diseases.
(Certification required)
C-Bass (Gitada), Silver Pompano (Narba), Cobia (Modusa), Shevand, etc.
5. When fish seed is imported for cage culture, it should be quarantined for a period of 14 days and tested for viral and bacterial diseases.
6. Seeds with genetic deformities should not be taken for cage culture.
7. Species wise size and number of cages to be stocked will be decided by the Fisheries Department.
3.3.3 Material, Design and Installation of Marine Cages The material used for construction of marine cages should be strong enough to withstand the harsh/ rough/ stormy weather conditions of the Indian Ocean. The structure of the cage net should ensure proper flow of water which will increase the water quality, reduce the pressure on the cage, improve feed conversion and help in storing more fish in the cage. Adequate spacing must be maintained. The use of chemicals and paints that are harmful to the environment should be avoided.
3.3.4 Feed 1. Any material/ raw material used for feeding shall be in conformity with the guidelines prescribed by the Department/ Competent Authority from time to time.
Page 22 of 8.
# Page 9
Government Resolution No: Matsyavi- 1120/ PR No. 201/ Padum 14
2. The feed should have physical properties suitable for consumption of fish with minimal loss of nutrients in water e.g. proteins/ carbohydrates etc.
Food should be good in terms of taste and digestibility.
Have a good food conversion ratio (FCR) and high growth rate. (Low FCR at High Growth Rate) This will reduce the expenditure on food.
Food should have optimum water stability.
Food should be free from chemicals and antibiotics.
7. For cage fisheries, only feed made from high quality raw material will be allowed.
Choose foods that are high in protein and fiber.
3.3.5) Good management practices
1.Avoid excessive stocking of fish seed.
2. The growth of fish should be verified/ checked at regular intervals.
3. Feed the farmed species with good quality and adequate quantity of feed.
4.Continue to clean and change your bedding regularly.
Avoid the use of antifouling paints and chemicals.
Physical, chemical and biological water quality should be regularly checked.
7. Regular monitoring of fish behaviour to assess health status.
3.3.6. Disease and Treatment Protocol (Regulation) Good hygiene always prevents diseases in fisheries. However, in the event of an outbreak of any disease
No antibiotics of any kind shall be allowed to be used in fish hatcheries, fish seed nurseries or cages.
2. Fish seeds should be vaccinated against common viral or bacterial diseases as per international standards before starting their use in cage culture.
