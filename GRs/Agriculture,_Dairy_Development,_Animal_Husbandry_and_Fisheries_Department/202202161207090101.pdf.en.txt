Sale Price/ 2021/8065, Dated 10.11.2021.
Various types of processing plants have been set up at various government dairies, government milk processing centers and milk plants etc. in the dairy development department. Most of the farms have been established for more than 30 years. Considering the increasing participation of private and cooperative sector in dairy sector, the Government has taken a policy decision in 2002 to phase out milk business. Therefore, many milk schemes/ projects are in limbo.
As a result, the equipment is outdated and beyond repair.
Therefore, it is necessary to disassemble the device.
The machinery and materials in the dairy and plant of the Dairy Development Department have been purchased about 30 years ago. Therefore, the purchase price of the purchased equipment/ material at that time is much lower than the cost of the new equipment/ material today. Hence, there is difficulty in determining the" hand price" of the machinery/ material to be specified as per the prevailing procedures of the Government. In this background, the government was considering to implement the government decision/ circular/ order issued by the Deputy Department of Dairy under the Padum Division and the Commissioner, Dairy Development in connection with the deletion and to lay down the procedure for the deletion of old and outdated machinery/ materials in the government milk scheme and cold storage center/ project.
Government Circular: Government Milk Scheme and Government Milk Refrigeration Center/ All Government Dairy Houses/ Aarey Colony/ Dapchari Project which are not in use and cannot be used elsewhere.

1) Government Circular No.DFP-1091/ Q.No. 4/ Regulations of the Department of Finance, d. 18/6/1991 lays down the procedure for determining the hand price of the equipment/ material to be specified. However, most of the machinery/ material in the Government Dairies and Refrigeration Centres and Dairy Plants under the Commissioner, Dairying have been procured about 30 years ago. Therefore, the then purchase price of the purchased equipment/ material is very less as compared to the cost of the new equipment/ material. In view of this fact, the committee should directly inspect the equipment and materials to be specified in the Government Milk Scheme/ Government Milk Refrigeration Centers and determine the depreciation value by considering the various components used in the machinery and materials such as brass, copper, aluminum, etc. Central Government approved Valuer (e.g. Insurance) with a view to increase revenue before finalization of valuation
