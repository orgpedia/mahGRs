The work of PM Kisan Yojana has been recorded at the national level as it has been implemented very well in the state. However, since March 2021, the functioning of the scheme has been adversely affected. In this regard, Govt. Minister of State (Finance) and
Minister of Agriculture and The Chief Secretary, State of Maharashtra has directed to hold meetings with the representatives of these various organizations from time to time and complete the work of the scheme in coordination with all the departments.
