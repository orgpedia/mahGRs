Introduction: Maharashtra is an industrial state with about 64 percent of the population working in agriculture and agro-based activities. The state has abundant marine and terrestrial fisheries resources.
2. Lack of trained and skilled manpower in the State and the expected growth rate in fisheries and aquaculture in the State. There is also a need for professionally competent trained manpower for the growth of fisheries and aquaculture development. This will play a major role in the development of the state. This will improve the lives of fishermen and fish farmers and also give a fair return to the entrepreneurs.
By 2025, there will be an estimated additional manpower requirement of about 32 lakh in the fisheries and allied sectors, especially in fisheries and value chain entrepreneurship development. There are three Fisheries Science Colleges functioning at Ratnagiri (Konkan), Nagpur (Vidarbha), and Udgir, Latur (Marathwada). Each college has a student strength of 40 and a maximum of 120 trained manpower can be available every year. This manpower is not enough. Due to lack of trained manpower, there is a lack of planning and entrepreneurship in the fisheries sector in the state.
Considering the abundant water resources of Amravati Division in Vidarbha, a total of 55,891 hectares of water area is available for fisheries and conservation in Amravati Division for Western Vidarbha under the projects of Major, Medium and Minor Irrigation Department and Zilla Parishad Lake. Aquaculture work has not yet started in big reservoirs like Upper Wardha, Benwala, Katepurna. Fisheries is an important agro-business and it is possible to increase the income of the general farmers by creating a supplementary livelihood through fisheries and conservation in the farmer suicide-prone Amravati region. Therefore, a new College of Fisheries Science needs to be created.
Despite the huge scope for employment and livelihood generation in the fisheries sector, there is no fisheries science college functioning in western Vidarbha at present. This College of Fisheries Science will be able to spread the technology in fish conservation in all the districts of Amravati division and create employment on a large scale. The proposal was submitted by the department
