The Proposal:
The State Government has taken a policy decision to transfer the subsidy given to the beneficiaries under various Central and State sponsored welfare schemes of the Government in cash to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) system, instead of in kind. 2 of the Planning Department. As per the Government decision dated 05.12.2016.
In accordance with the above Government decision of the Planning Department, the Department of Agriculture has decided to implement the direct benefit of subsidy through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) system in respect of agricultural implements to be distributed on subsidy under various Central and State sponsored schemes being implemented by the Department of Agriculture, as well as in respect of tenders for seeds, pesticides, micro-elements, organic fertilizers, micro-irrigation and irrigation devices. The above decisions have been taken by the government.
3. Reference No. 2 of the above Government Resolution No. As per Section 6 (e) of the Act, it is mandatory for the beneficiary farmers to purchase agricultural inputs from the authorised dealer in a cashless manner.
For this, the concerned farmer should pay the amount to the seller from his own bank account linked to his Aadhaar number. Accordingly, transactions such as NEFT, RTGS, IMPS, etc. should be done through electronic fund transfer or demand draft/ cheque. Also, you need to provide proof of the claim. However, farmers in rural areas do not have access to e-payment facility. Since the subsidy amount is low, the tender distributors do not accept cheques. Also, the farmers buy the produce on credit. Therefore, since it is not possible to use the cashless method mandated by the government, the subsidy cannot be given to the beneficiary farmers through the DBT system. As a result, the farmers are deprived of the benefits of government subsidies. Further, as demanded by the Commissionerate of Agriculture earlier, the approval for cash transaction for the financial year 2017-18 has been granted in 2017-18. Nevertheless, the farmers
