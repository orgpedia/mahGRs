Apart from the account holders, the farmers who do farming by family or lease are eligible to participate in this scheme.
Under this scheme, insurance premium will be charged at a realistic rate and to reduce the burden of insurance premium on farmers, the insurance premium to be paid by farmers has been limited to 2 percent for Kharif season, 1.5 percent for Rabi season and 5 percent for cash crops.
Under this scheme, the risk level has been fixed at 70 percent for all crops.

Crops and farmers covered under the scheme:
Under this scheme, insurance cover will be provided to food grain crops, sugarcane crops and cash crops. This scheme will be implemented for the following 15 crops at the level of revenue board/ mandal or taluka/ taluka as notified by the government for the kharif season in the state.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Pick category      | Notified crops                                                    |
| Cereals and pulses | Rice, Kharif Jowar, Bajra, Nachni, Maize, Tur, Moong, Urad, (8)   |
| Wheat crops        | Soybeans, groundnuts, sesame seeds, sunflowers, and pumpkins. (5) |
| Cash crops         | Cotton, kharif onion. (2)                                         |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paddy crop has been notified for the notified area in the state for which the threshold income and the average income of the current year have been determined by taking rice into account.
All farmers, including those cultivating notified crops in the notified areas, are eligible to participate in the scheme. The scheme is mandatory for farmers who take crop loans from various financial institutions and will be optional for non-loanee farmers.
4. Crop-wise insurance premium rates and insurance premium subsidy:
Under this scheme, the insurance premium rate will be charged at a realistic rate. However, the rate of premium per hectare to be paid by all farmers is as follows.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| A.A. | crops                         | Insurance premium to be paid by farmers                      |
| 1    | All cereals and legumes       | 2% of the sum insured or the actual rate whichever is lower. |
| 2    | Cash crops (cotton and onion) | 5% of the sum insured or the actual rate whichever is lower. |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Under this scheme, the difference between the crop-wise insurance premium per hectare and the actual premium to be paid by the farmers will be considered as general insurance premium subsidy and this subsidy will be given equally by the central and state governments. The premium subsidy from the state government to the insurance companies will be paid by the Agriculture Insurance Company of India (AIC).

Similarly, there is a huge variation in crop-wise crop loan rates within the districts and crop loan rates have been approved at abnormal rates in some districts as compared to the rates of the State Crop Loan Rate Committee. In this regard, the Crop Loan Rates of the districts which have fixed higher rates than the lending rates fixed by the State Crop Loan Rate Committee have been reviewed.
The details of district wise, crop wise insurance cover amount, insurance premium rate, insurance premium subsidy etc. in District Cluster Nos. 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 and 8 are enclosed in Form A-1 to A-34 (excluding Form A5, A10, A15, A19).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this regard, the possibility of identifying the notified area at the gram panchayat level and conducting crop harvesting experiments was discussed. However, since it is not possible to do so in reality, it has been decided to implement the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana at the level of Revenue Circle, Revenue Circle Group, Taluka. In this regard, 12 crop harvesting experiments are planned at the revenue board and revenue board block level in the current situation. Accordingly, while the Revenue Board or the Revenue Board is planning the crop harvesting experiment at the regional level at the block level, the District Collector of the concerned district is being given the freedom to plan the crop harvesting experiment at the gram panchayat level for at least 12 crops. The Collector should plan the crop cutting experiments for the notified crops in the notified areas for crop insurance in accordance with the resources, manpower available at the local level. Crop insurance should be used to calculate the average productivity of all these crop harvesting experiments to determine the average productivity of the notified crop of the notified area.
Under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, crop harvesting experiments are being conducted with the help of satellite images to get accurate and timely estimates of the yield obtained from crop harvesting experiments.

10. Method of determining compensation:
10.1: Determination of compensation based on average earnings at the end of the season.
The compensation under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana will be determined as per the provisions of the National Agriculture Insurance Scheme. The compensation to be determined will be based on the average figure of production available from the crop harvesting experiment in the insurance sector unit determined by the government. If the average yield per hectare of the insured crop in a specified area falls below the threshold yield for that year, it will be assumed that all insured farmers in that area have incurred a loss. The threshold yield or guaranteed yield in an insurance component shall be the average yield× risk level for all crops for the last 7 years (minimum yield of 5 years excluding 2 years of natural calamity/ drought etc.). Under this scheme, a uniform risk level of 70 per cent has been fixed for all crops. For determining the threshold yield, the average yield of the crop for at least 5 years excluding 2 years of natural calamities/ droughts etc. in the last 7 years will be taken into account.
As per the Government Decision No. 2014/ PROCESS 257/ M-7, dated 14.01.2015 and SCY-2015/ PROCESS 311/ M-7, dated 09.11.2015 and SCY-2016/ PROCESS 01/ M-7, dated 23.03.2016 of the Department of Revenue and Forest, the years 2014 and 2015 have been declared as drought years. The notified area and crop-wise threshold income for Kharif season 2018 has been made available on the website of the Department of Agriculture http:// www. krishi. maharashtra. gov. in.
Compensation formula:
Average annual income- the average annual income for the year.

4. Differences in sowing area: It has been observed during the last period of the scheme that at some places the area covered by insurance is more than the sown area and more insurance coverage is taken. To avoid this, the stakeholders should take appropriate action in terms of land record documents, bank documents, revenue documents and loan proposals. At present, computerized documentation of land records is not available at all levels and it is important for everyone to inspect the farm at an individual level. In this case, the following methods will be used.
If the difference between the insured area and sown area for the current year is less than 10% or 10%, the difference in sown area should not be taken into account.
If the difference between the insured area and the sown area for the current year is more than 10%, the difference in the sown area will be taken into account and the compensation will be reduced by taking into account the area improvement coefficient. The amount of insurance will be determined.
The premium of the reduced sum insured (farmer's share, state share and central share) will be reimbursed to the Central Government and the amount will be used for technology upgradation/ research etc.
Liability for compensation: The liability for compensation under the provisions of the scheme shall be borne by the insurance company concerned.
