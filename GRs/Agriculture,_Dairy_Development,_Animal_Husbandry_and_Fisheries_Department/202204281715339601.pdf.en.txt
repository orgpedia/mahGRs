Government's decision:
For the local level schemes of the Department of Animal Husbandry, target-wise funds under 31 Subsidiary Grants (Non-salaried) to the respective District Councils are made available through the Department of Animal Husbandry. The funds made available every year by the Animal Husbandry Department for the schemes/ veterinary institutions under the District Council must be spent for the purpose for which they have been made available. The matter has been brought to the notice of the Government through various media like starred questions/ unstarred questions etc. by the public representatives regarding the plight of many veterinary institutions under the Zilla Parishads. Also, the quality of services provided to farmers needs to be improved. It has also come to the notice of the government that the maintenance of machinery in many institutions is not being done on time, there is not enough stock of essential medicines, lack of basic facilities, pending electricity payments, etc. It is, therefore, necessary to ensure that the funds made available to the Zila Parishads under the Auxiliary Grants (Non-Salaried) Scheme by this Department are spent for the same purpose.
However, all the concerned should be directed to submit a fact-finding report on how much funds have been given to the Zila Parishads under the 31-Assistant Grants (non-salaried) for the schemes of the Animal Husbandry Department under the said target, how much of these funds have been spent on the schemes/ clinics of the Animal Husbandry Department through the Zila Parishads, whether these funds have been spent on the schemes of the Animal Husbandry Department or how. Accordingly, it is decided to constitute the following Committees at the Divisional level and at the State level in order to submit a fact-finding report in this regard and to take measures to ensure that the said funds are spent for the intended purpose:
