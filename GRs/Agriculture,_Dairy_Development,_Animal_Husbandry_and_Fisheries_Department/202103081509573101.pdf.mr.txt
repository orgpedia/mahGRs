(4) Revised Pay for Teachers and equivalent cadres : (i) Pay Fixation Method
The revised pay structure for different categories of Teaching and equivalent cadres positions
is based on the following:
a) The formula followed by the 7th CPC is followed in the academic pay structure, moving
from the concept of Pay Band and Academic Grade Pay to that of Academic Levels and
Cells.
b) The First academic level (corresponding to AGP of Rs.6000) is numbered as academic
level 10. Similarly, the other academic levels are 11, 12, 13A, 14 and 15.
c) Each cell in an academic level is at 3% higher than the previous cell in that level.
d) The Index of Rationalization (IOR) is 2.67 for present AGP less than Rs.10, 000 and 2.72
for the AGP of Rs.10, 000 and above.
e) The entry pay for each level is as follows:
------------------------------------------------
| Level | Academic Grade Pay (Rs.) | Entry Pay (Rs.) |
| 10 | 6,000 | 21,600 |
| 11 | 7,000 | 25,790 |
| 12 | 8,000 | 29,900 |
| 13A | 9,000 | 49,200 |
| 14 | 10,000 | 53,000 |
------------------------------------------------
f) The Pay matrix based on the above propositions on Academic Levels, Cells and Entry Pay
is at Appendix -I
g) For fixation of pay of an employee in the Pay Matrix as on 1st January, 2016, the existing
pay (Pay in Pay Band plus Academic Grade Pay) in the pre-revised structure as on 31st
December, 2015 shall be multiplied by a factor of 2.57. The figure so arrived at is to be
located in the Academic Level corresponding to employee's Pay Band and Academic
Grade Pay in the new Pay Matrix. If a Cell identical with the figure so arrived at is available
in the appropriate Academic Level, that Cell shall be the revised pay, otherwise the next
higher cell in that Academic Level shall be the revised pay of the employee. If the figure Page 3 of 24
# Page 4
Government Resolution No.: MAPAVI 2019/C.R. No. 37/ MAFSU
arrived at in this manner is less than the first cell in that Academic Level, then the pay shall
be fixed at the first cell of that Academic Level.
h) If a situation arises whenever more than two stages are bunched together, one
additional increment equal to 3 percent may be given for every two stages bunched,
and pay fixed in the subsequent cell in the pay matrix.
