issues were taken into account. The following points are included in the statement of the Sharad Joshi Vicharmanch Farmers Union:
1. Taking advantage of the Corona outbreak in the state, some dairy farmers have increased the price of milk by Rs. 10 to Rs 7. Many milk societies are not providing purchase/ receipt of information by registering dairy professionals after the farmers have given milk. In Pune-Satara district, the milk testing system is not being used even though it is available.

No records of milk quality (3.5 F and 8.5 SNF) are maintained. There is a huge gap between the collection and sale stocks of many milk institutions. There is a difference of 1 crore litres between the total milk production and demand. Raids should be conducted on those who do not give milk purchase invoices, check the production and actual milk stock.
3. Procurement and storage of milk should be checked. Private and cooperative milk societies are fleecing farmers by selling cattle feed at three times the MRP.
This should be investigated. Milk price hiked by Rs 40 The milk price of cow and buffalo should be announced at Rs 50.
The issues highlighted by the Sharad Joshi Vicharmanch Shetkari Sanghatana in their statement are mainly related to milk adulteration, non-issuance of purchase receipt after the milk is supplied by the milk plant operator, huge gap in collection and sale of milk by the milk societies, financial exploitation of farmers by private and cooperative milk societies by selling at triple the rate without writing MRP on animal feed. Since these issues pertain to the Food and Drug Administration, Commissioner, Dairying, Controller, Weights and Measures and Co-registrar, Cooperative Societies (Dairy) Authorities, they are requested to take action as follows:
1) Milk is adulterated in large quantities in the state. This could harm people's health. If this adulteration is controlled, it will be possible to supply clean and quality milk. A joint team of officials under the Commissioner, Food and Drug Administration and the Commissioner, Dairy, was formed to check adulteration of milk. The appointments have been made in accordance with the Government Decision dated 3rd March, 2020 issued by the Department of Medical Education and Pharmaceuticals.
As the action to be taken by this team needs to be done in a more efficient way, the team heads of the concerned district Assistant Commissioner (Food), Food and Drug Administration and District Dairy Development Officer, Dairy Development Department should take up the strike campaign. The action taken by this team should be done by the Controller Commissioner, Dairy and the progress report of the action taken under this should be submitted to the government every 15 days.
2) Non-issuance of purchase invoices of milk procured from milk producing farmers, keeping raw records of milk procurement, not using milk testing systems despite availability, not keeping quality records of milk, discrepancies between milk production and actual milk stock and such complaints are received by the government and the concerned authorities from time to time. All the District Dairy Development Officers, Dairy Development Department, Joint Director, Co-operative Societies (Dairy), Maharashtra State, Mumbai and Controller, Valid Metrology are concerned with them on these complaints.
