Government Decision No: WISA 1815/ PR No. 244/1 A Therefore, orders were issued to the concerned suppliers to replace or repair the said material. In this regard, due to non-replacement of defective/ defective material given to the concerned suppliers despite timely intimation to the concerned suppliers, the suppliers were blacklisted for 2 years for supplying to the Agriculture Department as per the Government Decision dated 31.7.2010 mentioned in No. 2 here.
As per the proceedings under the Vidarbha Package, the Assurance Committee of the Vidhan Sabha had suggested that these companies should be blacklisted permanently as these suppliers can supply substandard material even after two years. Accordingly, the matter of permanently blacklisting the concerned supplier companies from supplying to the Agriculture Department was under the consideration of the Government.
GOVERNMENT DECISION: In pursuance of the above proposal, the following manufacturers are being blacklisted permanently for supply of substandard/ defective materials under the Vidarbha Package to the Department of Agriculture.
