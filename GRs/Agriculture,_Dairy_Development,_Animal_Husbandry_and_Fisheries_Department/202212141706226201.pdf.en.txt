The Proposal:
Globally famous Nagpur orange is widely consumed in Vidarbha.
In our state, where the summer temperature goes up to 45-46 degrees Celsius. In such places also orange crop can be taken in a better way. The total area under orange crop in Maharashtra and central India is 2,78,000 hectares. At present, the total production of citrus fruits is 10.48 million tonnes, which includes orange (3.25 million tonnes), followed by paper lemon (2.10 million tonnes) and monsby (1.36 million tonnes). In Maharashtra, orange is grown mainly in Amravati, Nagpur, Wardha, Chandrapur, Yavatmal, Akola, Washim, Buldhana, Jalna, Ahmednagar, Parbhani, Hingoli, Aurangabad, Nanded and Jalgaon districts. Our country exports oranges to Bangladesh, Nepal, UAE, Burundi, Russia, Oman, Netherlands, Singapore, Spain, Maldives etc.
The total area under Nagpur orange in Vidarbha is 1,48,000 hectares, out of which 1,13,000 hectares is productive. The total 11 districts of Vidarbha produce 13 lakh 56 thousand tonnes of orange fruit every year. The normal market price is Rs. 20,000 per tonne and Rs. 2712 crore per annum. People of Vidarbha are getting employment due to the large area of orange crop in the region. Despite all this the production of this fruit crop in the state (8-9 tonnes) is very less in comparison to the country (11-12 tonnes) and other developed countries (25-30 tonnes).
Nagpuri oranges are the single most widely grown crop in the state. Therefore, there is a huge demand for new productive varieties from many farmers here. The orange variety in which attractive, deep orange color, appropriate amount of sugar and acid, thin and thick peel and generally 70 to 80 mm size fruit and high productivity are targeted to be developed.
In Maharashtra, orange crop is mainly grown commercially in the form of Nagpuri orange, blackberry and paper lemon. In order to increase the productivity of these
