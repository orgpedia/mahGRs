GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: KRIPU-2020/ P.S. NO. 12/4 A
The employee is awarded" Padma Shri Dr. Vithalrao Vikhe Patil, Krishi Sevaratna" by the state government since 2014.
On the lines of the above various awards, if the young farmers who have made remarkable and innovative achievements in the field of agriculture in the state are honoured with the award, then their willpower, morale will be boosted and the latest technologies will be used in the agriculture sector with more enthusiasm. With this objective, the State Government's Department of Agriculture was considering conferring the award to eight young farmers, one each from each of the Agriculture Departments of the State, for their contribution in enhancing agricultural production and for those young farmers who provide the benefit of their agricultural knowledge to other farmers in their locality and guide or encourage farmers to increase agricultural production, through journalism, social media or any other means.
Agricultural scientists have a unique contribution in the development of high yielding varieties (HYV), pest and disease resistant varieties and technologies in agriculture. In order to honour her work, the government was considering awarding the Best Agricultural Researcher Award to an outstanding researcher from an agricultural university for research in the field of agriculture from the year 2020-21.
Various government decisions were issued from time to time for the above various awards. Accordingly, different procedures were prescribed for different awards and different levels of committees were mentioned for making recommendations. This has resulted in various difficulties faced while making recommendations for the awards every year and delays in making recommendations and distribution of awards, besides the changing nature of the contributions of individuals, farmers/ institution groups working in the field of agriculture in tune with the changes in agriculture practices and technology every year, is expected to bring in ease and uniformity in the procedure for selection and recommendation of awards.
There were different types of forms for different awards to be applied by the farmers for the Krishi Puraskar, these different forms were causing confusion among the farmers. This is expected to bring uniformity by making changes in the form. A timeline is being worked out for holding a level-wise meeting for recommending the Krishi Puraskar and giving a time-bound format to the programme. So that the recommendations for the awards for that year can be made in the current year and the awards can be distributed in the same year.
