Avian Influenza (bird flu) is a highly contagious disease that can be transmitted from birds to humans. As per the guidelines issued by the Government of India in its Action Plan for Avian Influenza (Bird Flu) Disease Control 2021, it is necessary to deliberately destroy poultry and other domestic birds, bird feed, raw material for bird feed, eggs within a radius of 1 km of the disease outbreak to control the outbreak. This causes huge loss to the farmers. The Centre and state governments have to spend huge amounts of money to pay compensation for the deliberate destruction of poultry and other domesticated birds, bird feed, raw material for bird feed and eggs.
The Department of Animal Husbandry, Government of India has issued an Action Plan for Prevention, Control and Containment of Avian Influenza (Revised 2021) regarding Avian Influenza (Bird Flu) Disease Control Programme and it has been made available on the Central Government website www. dahd. nic. in. Accordingly, the Government is issuing the following decisions regarding the measures to be taken to prevent the outbreak of infectious and dangerous diseases like Avian Influenza (Bird Flu) on the poultry sector.
