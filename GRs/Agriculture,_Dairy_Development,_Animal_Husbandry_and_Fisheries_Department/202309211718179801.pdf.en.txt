This year's rainy season is coming to an end. Considering the rainfall received during the current year and the remaining monsoon period, if there is no sufficient rainfall, the water level/ moisture content in the soil will decrease and it cannot be ensured that the expected fodder yield is obtained by cultivating fodder crop in such land.
The lands in the submergence areas are going to be released/ uncovered due to depletion of water storage in the reservoirs of Major Projects/ Medium Projects/ Minor Projects under the Water Resources Department and Soil and Water Conservation Department. Due to the moisture in these soils and the irrigation system provided by the reservoir water in case of emergency, such lands are very useful for sowing fodder crops. It is possible to grow a large number of crops on this land. In this background, the government was considering a directive to bring the silt land of the reservoir under the control of the Water Resources and Soil and Water Conservation Department under the cultivation of fodder crops on priority.

Government's decision:
The state often receives less than average rainfall.
If there is a decrease in precipitation or insufficient rainfall in the future, the moisture in the soil will decrease over time. Therefore, this is the right time to cultivate fodder crops to overcome the fodder shortage situation in the coming days and take advantage of the available moisture.
The lands in the submerged areas will be free/ open due to reduction in water storage in the reservoirs of Water Resources and Soil and Water Conservation Department due to evaporation. Considering the moisture content of this land and the irrigation system available through the reservoir in the necessary conditions, it is possible to sow fodder crops on such land in large quantities and produce fodder. As such
In order to bring the silt land in the reservoirs of Major Projects/ Medium Projects/ Minor Projects under the Water Resources and Soil and Water Conservation Department under the cultivation of fodder crops only, it is being approved to allocate the silt land for fodder crops by adopting the siltation procedure under Schedule 17 of the Maharashtra Public Works Rules, 1978.
It has been observed that moor grass is more nutritious than other types of fodder and the use of moor grass increases the productivity and fertility of the animals. Apart from this, if the murgad is stored in an airtight condition, it can be used for a long time and after a long time, the availability of green fodder will be able to effectively overcome the fodder shortage without much impact on milk production. Therefore, fodder crops suitable for millets such as maize and sorghum should be grown in the alloted silt land.
Funds available through Central/ State Government schemes for distribution of fodder seeds.
Fodder and Animal Feeding Programme under District Annual Plan Read More 2 Decisions of the Government and the
Seeds of maize and sorghum will be made available within the limits of the reforms to be made.
To avoid fodder shortage in the future, all the collectors should plan the production of fodder by mapping the water sources and fodder production sources.
Further, the silt area available per unit/ project wise, area taken under fodder crop, fodder area

The data of the estimated income (metric ton) should be submitted by the Deputy Commissioner of District Animal Husbandry to the Commissioner Animal Husbandry, Pune.
The following committees are being formed for selection, coordination and control of the beneficiaries to eradicate the fodder shortage by taking fodder production on the silt land.
(i) District Collector- Chairman (i) District Superintendent Agriculture Officer- Member (ii) Superintendent Engineer (Irrigation)- Member (iv) Executive Officer Soil and Water Conservation- Member (v) District Animal Husbandry Officer- Member (vi) District Animal Husbandry Deputy Commissioner- Member Secretary
The decision was taken by the Water Resources Department. The 75. 14.9.2023 and Department of Soil and Water Conservation No. 2980, d. being issued pursuant to the agreement dated 11.9.2023.
