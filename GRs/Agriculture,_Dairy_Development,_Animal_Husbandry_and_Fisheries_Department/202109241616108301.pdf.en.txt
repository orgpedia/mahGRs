Government Circular No. Sankirna- 2021/222/ S.No.08/ Padum-17
Madam Cama Marg, Hutatma Rajguru Chowk,
Ministry Extension, Mumbai- 400 032.
Date is September 24, 2021.
The Proposal:
The Maharashtra Livestock Development Board (MSDB), the Maharashtra Livestock Development Corporation (MIDC) and the Maharashtra Livestock Development Corporation (MIDC) are the implementing agencies for the project. The officers/ employees of the Maharashtra Fisheries Development Corporation under the Fisheries Department file cases in the court as there is no quasi-judicial mechanism available for redressal of any kind of complaints, representations and other matters related to their service and other subject matters. The regular functioning of the Corporation is adversely affected as the time, money and manpower of the Corporation are used to dispose of these petitions and take appropriate judicial action.
Therefore, it was under the consideration of the Government to implement a quasi-judicial system to provide justice to the officers/ employees of Punyashlok Ahilyadevi Holkar Sheep and Goat Development Corporation, Pune, Maharashtra Livestock Development Board, Nagpur and Maharashtra Fisheries Development Corporation, Mumbai in their service matters and other matters at the administrative level.
Government Circular: The officers/ employees of Punyashlok Ahilyadevi Holkar Sheep and Goat Development Corporation, Pune, Maharashtra Livestock Development Board, Nagpur, and Maharashtra Fisheries Development Corporation, Mumbai will be required to use the quasi judicial system first to redress any kind of complaint, representation and other matters regarding their services and other subjects and to seek justice for them.
