(3) The Government of the Department of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, Dairy Development and Fisheries Decision No. Poultry 2021/ Q. No. 06/ Padum-4, D. 20.01.2021.
The Proposal:
ASCAD (Assistance to States for Control of Animal Diseases) is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme under the Livestock Health and Disease Control (HDDC) Scheme, being implemented in the State of Maharashtra since 2003-04. The ratio of Central share to State share for different sub-components included in the scheme is 60:40, 50:50 and 100%. Read No. Under the various 03 Fund Distribution Orders issued herein, the Central Government has released funds to the State under General, Scheduled Castes Sub-Plan and Tribal Area Appropriation in 2019-20.
Since the funds are released to the State by the Central Government initially only under the General Scheme and thereafter under the General and Scheduled Castes Appropriations, separate accounting heads have been approved for 100% and 60% Central share and 40% State share equivalent thereto under the General and Scheduled Castes Appropriations for various programmes under the Escad Scheme. However, since the funds were already released to the State under Tribal Area Appropriation in 2019-20 by the Central Government, and due to non-availability of head of accounts with the Department under Tribal Area Appropriation, the funds released remain unutilized.
The following Government Decision is being issued to provide administrative approval for implementation of the Centrally Sponsored/ ASCED Scheme in the State.
