Since the above proposed rates do not include the service charges prescribed by the Government from time to time for providing various veterinary services to the livestock of farmers/ cattle rearers, the amount should be paid to the Government by levying the service charge at the rate prescribed/ to be prescribed by the Government.
While dealing with medical or surgical cases for visiting the doorstep of farmers, the cost of travel of the veterinarians to the farmer's house/ area is not to be charged separately as it is included in the revised rates. The animal husbandry department should make available all the medicines, equipment, tools etc. required for the treatment or surgery.
The revised rates as above shall be applicable only to veterinary doctors in Government service from the date of issue of the said Government Order.
The Commissioner Animal Husbandry, Papunay shall review the revised rates as agreed upon above every five years and submit the proposal to the Government with appropriate justification for revision, if required.
This decision was taken with the concurrence of the Finance Department as well as the Department's Informal Reference No. 263/ 2021, dt. 22.04.2022 and is being issued with their consent.
