Introduction: The State Government has announced long lockdown periodically since March 2020 to contain the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. This lockdown has adversely affected fisheries along with other businesses. Since the ground water fishing season is mainly during March, April, May, the fishermen cooperatives have not been able to fish as expected since March 2021 as the expected customer base/ market is not available for selling the fish caught due to the outbreak of COVID-19 in most of the ponds/ water bodies. Fishermen cooperatives in the state have demanded through a memorandum to waive the lake contract amount for the year 2021-22 of fishermen/ fish breeders and fisheries cooperatives in the state due to the lockdown announced in connection with the corona infection. Accordingly, the government was considering adjusting the lake contract amount for the year 2021-22 for the fishermen/ fisheries and fisheries cooperatives in the state for the year 2023-24 and waiving the lake contract amount for the year 2021-22 for the fishermen/ fisheries and fisheries cooperatives who could not pay the lake contract amount.
Government's decision:
The government has taken this decision in view of the losses incurred by the fishermen due to the lockdown announced in the wake of Corona infection, the fishermen/ fish farmers and fisheries cooperative societies of the state have been unable to adjust the contract amount of the lakes for the year 2021-22 and the contract amount of the lakes for the year 2021-22
