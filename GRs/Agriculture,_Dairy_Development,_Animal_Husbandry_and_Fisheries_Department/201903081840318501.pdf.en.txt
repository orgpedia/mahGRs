Government Resolution No: LVESU 2018/ No.8/ Padum-8
Ministry (Extension), Mumbai 400 032
The date: March 8, 2019.
Read:- 1) The date of the Government Decision in the Government Schedule is July 20, 2018.
(2) The date of the Government Resolution dated 31st July, 2018.
Decision of the Governing Council dated 17 November 2018.
The Proposal:
The Government has decided to provide an incentive subsidy of Rs.50/-per kg and Rs.5/-per litre to cooperative and private milk powder plants for export of milk powder and liquid milk in the State under the Government decision at Reference No. 1. Under the same decision, a subsidy of Rs.5/- per litre was made permissible for the remaining 3.2/8.3 (cow milk) and above quality milk excluding packaged milk produced in the state. The scheme was initially implemented till 31st October, 2018. In view of the response to the scheme, the Government in its decision at Reference No. 2 has extended the scheme from 1st November, 2018 to 31st January, 2019. The milking season in the state usually lasts till the month of April every year. Therefore, in view of the situation of surplus milk in the current period, it has become necessary to extend the deadline of the scheme being implemented under the Government Decision No. 1 in the context to April 30, 2019. At present, the price of milk has gone up in the international market. Therefore, in view of the increase in milk powder production and the need to use the remaining surplus milk, even if some part of the milk is used for milk powder conversion, a proposal was under the consideration of the Government to provide a subsidy of Rs. 3/- per litre instead of the subsidy of Rs. 5/- per litre fixed under the Government decision at Reference No. 1, 2 and 3.
Government's decision:
The Government hereby extends the scheme announced under Reference No. 1 with retrospective effect for a period of three months i.e. from 1st February, 2019 to 30th April, 2019. A subsidy of Rs 3 per litre will be admissible for this period. The remaining terms and conditions of the Government Decision No. 1, 2 and 3 in this regard shall remain in force.
