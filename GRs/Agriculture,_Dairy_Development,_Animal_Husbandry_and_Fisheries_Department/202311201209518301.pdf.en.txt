Government Order No: DAHD- 14021/1/2023-AH-4 (E-698659) Madam Cama Road, Hutatma Rajguru Chowk,
Mantralaya, Mumbai- 400 032

Government order:
India ranks first in milk production in the world. As per the data of 2021-22, the per capita availability of milk per day is 444 grams, whereas the availability of milk in the state is 315 grams. The per capita availability of milk in the state is 129 gram less than the national average.
2. The State ranks 6th in milk production in the country and as per the 20th Livestock Census 2019, there are a total of 1,95,95, 996 cows and buffaloes in the State, out of which 56,22,527 cows and 32,81,657 buffaloes are productive. At present, only 18 per cent of cows and buffaloes in the state are being artificially milked as compared to the number of cows and buffaloes that can be bred. There are around 40 lakh stray cattle in the state.
3. Milk productivity of milch cows and buffaloes in the State is low in comparison to other States which are leading in milk production in the country. Also, there are a large number of non-milk producing animals. The main reason for the inbreeding of the animals is the lack of milk. Generally 40 to 60 percent of the milch animals are found to have the problem of infertility or infertility. To increase milk production in the state, it is necessary to increase the fertility of cows and buffaloes. For this it is essential that the growth and body weight of the cows and buffaloes should be according to the expected parameters.
4. Physical weight gain is directly related to animal breeding and higher fertility is observed in cattle with expected body weight gain. Generally, the length of the canal is 250 km and that of the river is 275 km. G. Indicates the first gain after gaining body weight. All livestock owners should keep a weekly record of weight gain to control the animal's body weight. The animals in which the reduction in body weight is seen from the physical weight register for three consecutive weeks, there is a strong possibility of lack of reproduction and the danger of infertility in such animals.
Each veterinarian needs a tape to measure the weight of the livestock. In all veterinary clinics/ clinics, the following instructions for recording the body weight of animals by simple measurement should be displayed at the point of view.

Body weight (kg) g)= (Chest circumference in inches) 2 x Length 660 in inches
5. For increasing body weight, livestock should be provided with 1 kg of fodder per day, abundant green and dry fodder, exercise in free circulation management and daily 50 gm of mineral mixture, pesticides and plenty of drinking water.
6. If the infection is found after dung test, the disease should be eradicated and if the deficiency of some elements is found after blood test, then appropriate treatment should be adopted.
7. If the cows and buffaloes come to the cowshed within 90 days of calving and remain in the cowshed, it helps in reducing the duration of calving. If artificial sanding is not done at the right time after the cows/ buffaloes come to the mother, the distance between the two sets of animals increases, the goal of getting one calf a year is not achieved, and the expenditure on animal feed increases, causing financial losses to the cattle farmers.
8. State to provide for the removal of infertility in cows and buffaloes belonging to farmers, cattle rearers. 20.11.2023 to dt. In pursuance of the" State-wide Infertility Eradication Campaign" being directed during 19.12.2023, the campaign should cover various aspects as under:

During this period, information should be collected about the name of the cattle rearers in the jurisdiction of the veterinary institution, village-wise breedable animals, animals with infertility problems, stray cows and buffaloes, and unmanned canals/ ponds.
8.2 Organizing Infertility Camps under the Infertility Eradication Campaign: 8.2.1 In order to ensure that the cycle of mating between cows and buffaloes is regular, special attention needs to be paid to the diet and health of the animals.

Along with regular spraying of the medicine, guidance should be given to the cows and buffaloes to get the infection done at regular intervals.
8.2.5 During the sterilization camp, the cattle rearers should be guided about the approximate number of days the animals were in the mother's cycle and the approximate time when they will be in the next stage, the various causes of infertility in cows and buffaloes, its types, measures to be taken, medicines, etc.

8.2.8 All calves and mares who are of age and not showing mating should be sexually examined to determine whether or not the calves/ mares have fully developed genitalia.
8.2.9 Repeat Breeders should be tested on the day of the mating cycle. Collect the oestrus discharge in a clean test tube and boil it a little with one percent sodium hydroxide mixture. If the discharge is white, the animal is not suffering from endometritis, and if the discharge is yellow, it is confirmed to be endometriosis. The darker the color, the more itching. Similarly, the pH of the discharge should be checked to ensure that it is neutral 6.5 to 7.5.
8.2.10 Release appropriate medication into the uterus of animals that are constantly vomiting, and use hormones as needed after consulting a specialist veterinarian.
