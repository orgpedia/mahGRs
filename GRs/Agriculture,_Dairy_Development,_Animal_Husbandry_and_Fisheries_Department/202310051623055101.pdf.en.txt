Government Resolution No.- Kruvapadum- 33030/18/2023/ (641278)/ MAG/ Padum- 4 Madam Cama Road, Hutatma Rajguru Chowk,

Introduction: Livestock sector has played a key role in the Indian economy with a total contribution of 4.11% to the Gross Domestic Product in 2021-22. While the livestock population in India has increased by 1% during 2012-2019, the total indigenous cattle population has declined by 6% as compared to the last census. Maharashtra's total cattle population is 13.9 million, which is a decrease of 10% compared to the previous animal census. It is a matter of concern that the livestock population of Dangi, Deoni, Gawalau, Khillar and Lal Kandhari registered breeds of cattle in Maharashtra is showing a declining trend. Apart from these breeds, the livestock population of other Indian bovine breeds of high genetic quality like Gir, Sahiwal, Tharparkar is also decreasing day by day.
Selective breeding is carried out through the state-of-the-art technology of MOET (Multiple Ovulation and Embryo Transfer) and OPU-IVF (Ovum Pick Up In vitro Fertilization). And it is possible to increase the number of high quality/ pedigree cattle. Making the services of this technology available at the doorstep of the farmers will help in the rapid increase in the number of cattle of valuable breeds of indigenous cows and buffaloes.
3. In the above background, it is necessary to use this technique in general to produce more canals with high genetic properties at a faster rate with the help of OPU-IVF ET technology. Using this technology, it will be possible to conserve the endangered bovine species. In addition to this, it is possible to reproduce having a predetermined sex using sex reassigned semen for IVF.
A cow with high productivity can give birth to only 8-12 calves in her lifetime.
If the embryo implantation technology is adopted in the same cow, it is possible to breed approximately 8 to 10 calves in a year from such cows and approximately 50 to 60 calves in her lifetime through a surrogate mother. The beetles produced by this technique can be stored for several years in a liquid solution at a temperature of minus 196 degrees Celsius.

OPU-IVF& ET to conserve the local breed of cows/ buffaloes in Maharashtra by increasing their productivity, considering the decline in their population.
Modern technology should be used.
Accordingly, a total of 06 antigen testing laboratories will be set up in each revenue division of the state. The Cabinet meeting held on 16th September, 2023 at Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar has approved and accordingly the Government is issuing the following decision.
Government's decision:
In the year 2023-24, the Government is approving the establishment of 06 Vetting Labs for each Revenue Division of the State as follows:

10. Establishment of a beetle transplantation laboratory at an estimated cost of Rs. 450.68 lakh is expected to be spent for setting up of 06 such embryo transplantation laboratories in the State. The estimated cost is Rs. 2704.08 lakh. Subsidy for recurring expenditure will be payable annually after establishment for all the six laboratories.
11. Details of purchase of equipments and machinery are enclosed at Annexure' A," details of purchase of mobile vans with necessary equipments are enclosed at Annexure' B" and details of purchase of media and consumables are enclosed at Annexure' C."
12. Efforts should be made to make these laboratories self-sufficient by making the farmers and animal husbandry owners aware of the benefits of this advanced technology.
13. Embryo transplantation technology should be implemented by adopting the following three different approaches.
13.1 Option-A:- If the donor cow/ buffalo is available with the cattle rearer, the female seeds from the donor cow/ buffalo should be collected from his stable and the female seeds should be fertilized in the laboratory using semen, the prepared beetles should be transplanted into the other recipient cow/ buffalo from the cattle rearer at the expense of the farmers. In this way, by collecting maximum 3 times the female seed from the donor cow/ buffalo of the animal husbandry, the pregnancy of one recipient cow/ buffalo should be determined. For each such procedure, Rs. A fee of Rs. 10,000 has to be paid.
After collecting the female seed from the donor cow/ buffalo, the female seed must reach the beetle transplantation laboratory within the specified time, so the maximum distance from the laboratory is 100 km.
The female seeds should be collected from the donor cows of the farmers and cattle rearers in the area.
13.2 Option-B):- If the donor cow/ buffalo is not available with the animal husbandry, the beetle transplantation laboratory will charge Rs. 21,000/- to the animal husbandry department on payment of service charge, the donor cow/ buffalo with high yielding capacity should be impregnated in the recipient cow/ buffalo at the cost of the farmer by Oestrus Synchronization.
In case the embryos to be provided to the animal husbandry under this option are not available in the laboratory, there may be a need to procure the female seed of donor cow/ buffalo with high production capacity from private animal husbandry/ institutions. For this, the concerned private animal husbandry/ institution will be provided Rs. 10,000/- should be paid as incentive. Under this process, the cost of testing for diseases like TB, JD, Brucellosis, IBR etc. should be borne by the implementing agency.

13.3 OPTION-E):- If the private animal husbandry/ institutions/ sterilization laboratories require female/ male calves born through embryo transplantation, the required donor is cow/ buffalo.
Section No. be made available as specified in 13.2. The complete process of embryo transplantation should be done by the laboratory and the price should be fixed according to the pedigree of the calf and the calf should be sold.
To complete the process of embryo transplantation through the laboratory, the uterus of low-yielding cow/ buffalo from other livestock should be used. 10,000/- per calf born through embryo transplantation (Rs.5,000/- on confirmation of pregnancy after 90 days pregnancy test and Rs. 5,000/- (after the birth of the calf)
In this way, the use of cows/ buffaloes of normal milk production capacity as surrogate mothers will provide new employment to the cattle rearers.
The following designations are being approved for setting up of 14.06 Laboratories. (Rs. attention)
