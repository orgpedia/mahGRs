Government Resolution No. Matsyavi-2018/ No.64/ Padum-13,
Mantralaya, Mumbai 400 032

1. Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India, Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries, Letter No. FNO- 31036/04/07-FY-3, Dy. 13/02/2015 2. Letter from Commissioner Fisheries, Fish/ Land/ 021506/30/2010, D. 26/12/2017
Introduction: Fish seed is a pre-requisite and important aspect in the process of fish culture. Quality fish seed provides assured fish production. Also, increased lake productivity will lead to successful and sustainable fisheries entrepreneurship. The certification system of aquaculture has gained momentum due to the increasing demand of consumers globally. This system will be applicable to all (private/ government and other) fish seed production centres, rearing/ conservation centres, conservation/ rearing of fish seed, fish seed, fish boat, nauplia, post-harvest, fish breed etc. The system will also help in maintaining the quality of fish seed and sustainable fish production in the state as it incorporates environmental aspects. The Government of India, as directed by the letter of reference 1 of Krishi Bhawan, was considering to announce the system of certification of fish seed as well as accreditation of fish seed centers in the state of Maharashtra.
Central Government Resolution No. As per the instructions given under letter No. 1, the Government is approving the system of certification of fish seed and certification of fish seed centers as follows.
Under the above referenced letter, the Central Government has issued guidelines for the registration of fish seed production centres/ conservation centres, which include storage ponds, conservation and rearing ponds for conservation of various species of fish like Indian Major Carp, other carp, imported species, all fish of total conservation value, sweet and saltwater shrimp, ornamental fish and production centres/ conservation centres for conservation and rearing of fish/ shrimp/ other aquatic species in freshwater and brackish water. Accordingly, it is mandatory to register all rearing/ conservation centres in the state. However, it is mandatory to register the Central Coastal Aquaculture with the conservation/ rearing centres in the area of operation or for aquaculture.

(2) In accordance with the said guidelines, the State guidelines for aquaculture/ fish farming in the State are required to be implemented as per the directions of the Central Government.
These guidelines cover the breeding/ conservation/ rearing/ storage ponds in fresh water, saltwater fisheries, all viable domestic and imported fish species and species of sweet and saltwater shrimp.
Will apply to ornamental fish species.
No person, co-operative society, private enterprise, private/ partnership firm shall, without the permission of the competent authority, breed/ rear/ maintain in a pond any of the protected species of fish such as Indian Major Carp, indigenous/ exotic fish species, air-breathing fish, freshwater shrimp, saltwater shrimp, ornamental fish.
(b) All other protected species, domestic or foreign, except those prohibited by the Government, may be protected by fisheries. Conservation of exotic species can be done only after obtaining permission from the competent authority.
(a) As per the directions given by the Central Government under the reference letter, a committee has been constituted for certification of fish seed and certification of fish seed centers at the state level.
It is mandatory. The mandate of the committee will be to regulate the production of quality seeds produced from the fish culture centres and the productivity of the centres across the state. At the same time, the quality and quantity of seeds are controlled. Therefore, it will be mandatory for the entrepreneurs to get the first approval of the State Government's Fish Seed Certification and Certification Committee of the Fish Seed Center for conservation native and exotic species such as carp, air-breathing fish, sweet and saltwater shrimp, other conservation species, ornamental fish species, etc. Also for conservation/ rearing of freshwater or brackish water species in conservation/ storage ponds.
Also, it is mandatory to get approval from the state level apex committee that certifies the fish seed certification and fish seed centers in the state for the use of various species.

As per the Central Government's System of Certification of Fish Seed Certification and Certification of Fish Seed Centers 2015, the existence of unregistered fish seed centers has been declared illegal (NULL& VOID). Similarly, in Maharashtra, the existence of a cultivator will be illegal (NULL& VOID) if it is not registered under this system.
Registration and certification under the system of Fish Seed Certification and Certification of Fish Seed Centre is mandatory for establishing fish seed centres with conservation, conservation and nurturing practices required for conservation of conservation fish like Indian Head Carp, Air Breathing Fish, indigenous species as well as imported species from abroad, sweet and saltwater prawns, ornamental fish.
Functions of the Certification Committee
Fish seed production center is being implemented in the state as per the certification program.
To ensure this and to remove the problems in the implementation of the certification system in the state and to prepare a proper procedure for the implementation of this system.
To provide necessary infrastructure, manpower and funds for the implementation of the certification programme.
(c) to authorise persons or agencies to undertake certification of fish seed centres, assessment and preparation of reports.

Government Resolution No: Matsyavi-2018/ PR No.64/ Padum-13
To take up awareness programmes for procuring and storing fish seeds from certified fish seed production centres.
(c) Preparation of guidelines for selection and monitoring of breeders, methods of fish seed production, testing procedures by experts.
Guidelines and procedures for permitting fish seed production units for breeding of culturable fish species, freshwater shrimp and ornamental fish.
The applicant [Farmers/ Entrepreneurs/ Co-operative Societies/ Private Individuals/ Company (Private Limited, Public Limited& others) and those who wish to establish a fish seed production center] should apply for registration in the prescribed form prescribed by the Joint Committee for Fish Seed Certification and Fish Seed Center Certification for all types of seed producers such as Indian Major Carp, Air Breathing Fish, Godaya or Saltwater Shrimp, ornamental fish. (Figure 1).
2 Fish Seed Certification The Certification Committee shall approve the design and layout of the Seed Production Centre, the capacity of the Seed Production Centre, inspect the way in which the conservation/ production will be carried out, and ensure that there is a system to treat the fish separately in case of any disease or infection.
It is mandatory to certify the seeds before selling them to the fish farmers, farmers or institutions/ organizations/ associations from the seed production center.
4. In order to increase the survival rate of the breeders, feed should be provided to the breeders containing all the elements and maintaining the proper mineral content.
The Regional Level Summit Committee should consider only those centers which are not under the jurisdiction of the Coastal Aquaculture Authority for registration.
The centre for registration should not be located in flood affected areas and should not be located in the buffer zone around the sanctuary, bio reserve, eco park and in areas where the water of the centre is released in an unsafe manner.
7. The Committee for Certification of Fish Seed Certification and Seed Production Centre for the country's species is working towards making available quality seeds and good quality breeder seed production centres for the same. However, taking seeds of a foreign variety without certifying it will hamper the entire process of certification.
