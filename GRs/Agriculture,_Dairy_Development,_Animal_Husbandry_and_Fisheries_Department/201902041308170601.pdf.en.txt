(4) The Vice-Chancellor of the Agricultural University shall, in the event of superannuation, be entitled to be appointed to the service of the University for a period not exceeding one year, notwithstanding anything contained in Articles 45, 74 and 84 of the Statutes. The Aurangabad bench of the Allahabad High Court. 10436/2018 (Vice-Chancellor, Mahatma Phule Agricultural University, Rahuri Vs. Dattu Bapu Bokare) along with Writ Petition No. 11366/2018 in this regard. By an order dated 16/10/2018, the Vice-Chancellor, Mahatma Phule Agricultural University, Rahuri, has allowed temporary appointments of some labourers for a period of 11 months to continue for about 6 years (till the availability of regular staff). It has been brought to the notice of the Governor, State of Maharashtra and the Vice-Chancellor, Agricultural Universities and if such appointments are continued for a long time and then such appointments are cancelled or not re-appointed, the concerned employees, aggrieved by the non-appointment, appeal to the competent court and seek a stay on the appointment. The court orders the payment of monetary benefits in the form of compensation to the employee concerned.
As a result, the government is bearing a huge financial burden. The Supreme Court has also said this. Also Ma. The High Court has taken cognizance of the matter and issued appropriate directions. It has been sent to the Governor, Maharashtra State and the Vice-Chancellor, Agriculture University. 11366/2018. By order dated 16/10/2018, Smt. The court has also ordered that the compensation amount to be paid to the workers concerned should be recovered from the salary of the vice-chancellor instead of from the funds of the agricultural university.
Further, it has come to the notice of the Government that in a case of Vasantrao Naik Marathwada Agricultural University, Parbhani, the Vice-Chancellor has given temporary appointments to 37 candidates in excess of the sanctioned posts and has continued such appointments for a long time.
Such a thing puts an undue and avoidable financial burden on the government, which is happening due to the non-compliance of the prescribed provisions of the rules by the Vice-Chancellor of the university. Such action is not expected from the Vice Chancellors of the universities and they should not entertain this matter.
In view of the aforesaid provisions of the Maharashtra Agricultural Universities Act, 1990, s. 45, 74 and 84, the appointments to be made in accordance with the provisions of the said Act shall be made only on ex-officio basis and for a period not exceeding one year.

There is a provision to do and to take action regarding the filling up of the concerned post within this 1 year period. As per the above provision of the Statutes, appointments to be made in the event of superannuation are not expected to be continued for a period of more than one year. Thus, the provisions of the Statutes regarding appointments to be made in the service of the University on exigencies are very self-explanatory. However, it is very serious that the Vice Chancellor of the Agricultural University is not following the provisions of the Statutes strictly and is frequently violating the self-explanatory provisions of the Statutes.
