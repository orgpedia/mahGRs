Preamble: The Central Government has approved the implementation of the Rabi Pulse Crops Cultivation Programme (TRFA Pulse) on Paddy Area in the State during 2021-22. As per the letter dated August 13, 2021, Rs.
116.67 lakhs (Central share Rs. 70.00 lakhs and State share Rs. 46.67 lakhs) annual work plan has been approved.
Central government. Issue No. 13 of August 2021. 5 The TRFA programme is to be implemented as per the norms of the regular NSSA (Groundnut) Mission.
As per the norms of the N.A.S.A. (Wheat Mission), it is mandatory to adopt certified seeds of varieties within 10 years while conducting crop demonstrations. However, the National Seeds Corporation does not have certified seeds of 10-year varieties of groundnut and mustard crops in the Rabi season. Also, the sesame crop is in short supply and the seeds are essential for the implementation of the RASUA (Groundnut) Mission.
Seeds of 10 years old varieties of groundnut are available with the seed supplier organization. Therefore, the Central Government has been given the opportunity to use seeds of varieties above 10 years for the additional programme of TREA (Groundnut). The request has been made vide letter dated 18.08.2021. The central government is already looking into the matter.
As per this administrative approval, the TRFA (Groundnut) programme will be planned keeping in view the sowing period of the Rabi season. Crop demonstrations of 10 years old varieties will be held only after the Central Government gives permission for 10 years old varieties, otherwise the program will be implemented within the seed limit of 10 years old varieties available.
The central government. As per the letter dated 13.08.2021, for the year 2021-22, under the National Food Security Mission, Rabi Pulse Crops Cultivation (TRFA Pulse) programme on Paddy in the State.
