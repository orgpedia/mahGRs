The Proposal:
Captive cage fish farming is a high technology based method which can lead to higher fish production. Therefore, to tackle the problem of malnutrition in the state, to increase the availability of protein-rich foods, to establish a cage-style fish conservation project and to increase the fish production in the state for the purpose of employment, cage-style fish farming (Read No. 1% of the total water area in the reservoirs above 200 hectares as per the decision of the Government. Under the government's purification letter, it has been decided to lease 0.5% of the total water area in reservoirs below 200 hectares, but not less than 15 hectares and with a minimum depth of 10 meters. Cage fish farming is not allowed in water bodies below 1000 hectares as mentioned in the guidelines of the Central Government. However, since the number of reservoirs above 1000 hectares in the state is less (46), permission has been given to implement cage fish conservation projects in the available 2448 reservoirs in the state. In view of the flaws in this policy, the Commissioner Fisheries Office (Read No. 5) The proposal has been submitted to the government in accordance with the changes to be made in the above policy. Accordingly, the earlier reference regarding cage fish culture in ponds/ water bodies vide No.
