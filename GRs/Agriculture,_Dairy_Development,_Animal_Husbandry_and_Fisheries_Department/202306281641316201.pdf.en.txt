Introduction: Maize is a multi-faceted cereal crop. Maize is the second most important crop globally after rice and wheat. Maize is an important crop as it yields more than other cereal crops. Maize is a crop that comes in different climatic and geographical regions and comes in all three seasons. There is a huge demand for maize crop in all the developed and developing countries for food grains as well as for industrial use. The demand for maize crop is increasing in poultry feed, animal feed and industrial sectors. As a result, the area under maize crop in the state of Maharashtra is showing a significant increase.
Maize is an important crop of Maharashtra state with an area of about 11.48 lakh hectares under maize. The average production of the crop is 2659 kg per hectare and the production is 305.40 lakh tonnes.
Similarly, in Marathwada, the area under this crop is about 2.99 lakh hectares and the crop productivity is 1996 kg per hectare with a production of 59.85 lakh tonnes. In Maharashtra, maize is grown more in the kharif season than the rabi season. Similarly, the area under maize crop is also increasing in the Rabi and Summer season. Aurangabad district has the highest area under maize in the state of Maharashtra (2.03 lakh hectares). Nashik (Rs 1.016 lakh). Jalgaon (0.69 lakh). Buldhana (0.549 lakh). 0.568 lakh) and Rs. The productivity in this district is higher than other districts. The area under maize crop is also increasing rapidly in Buldhana, Yavatmal and Akola districts. Marathwada accounts for 36 per cent of the total area under maize in Maharashtra and 32 per cent of the total production. Most of these areas are dry, so there is a lot of scope for maize crop growth in Marathwada.
The production of maize in Maharashtra and Marathwada is at par with the national production. The main reason for low productivity of maize crop is changing climate, lack of intercropping system,

GOVERNMENT DECISION NO. 1222/ Q.No. 209/7-A
Because of less use of fertilizers, less facility of irrigation, growing crops in light soil and not giving water during depression etc. the production of maize crop decreases.
Maize is grown in all types of climates (cold, temperate, hot) and all types of geographical conditions.
Farmers in Aurangabad and Jalna regions of Marathwada region have been sowing maize on a large scale for the last few years. Considering the climatic, geographical and land conditions of Marathwada, research in other departments will not be useful in this area. There is a need to conduct independent research considering the climatic conditions of the region and the technical requirement of the soil of the farmers.
In-depth research is required on various topics such as improved maize cultivation technology, pest and disease protection, weed management, intercropping methods, food and water management, value addition, etc. As the weather changes, the disease increases and the yield decreases.
Therefore, if a research center is set up in Aurangabad division, it will help in finding pests and disease resistant varieties, pest management technology, study the effect of changing climate on pest diseases on maize crop, etc.
With the help of research experiments, it will be possible to give proper guidance to the farmers.
At present, the centrally sponsored All India Coordinated Maize Improvement Project funded by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) is being implemented in Kolhapur and the research center is under the jurisdiction of Mahatma Phule Agricultural University, Rahuri. The above Research Centre is working for Western Maharashtra. Farmers in Aurangabad, Jalna and Buldhana districts of Marathwada region have been cultivating maize for the last few years. Keeping in view the various requirements of rainfall, climate, geography and agriculture in the state, it is necessary to establish a maize research center in Marathwada region. The matter of setting up a maize research center on government land in Sillod, Aurangabad was under consideration of the government.
The decision was taken by Vasantrao Naik Marathwada Agriculture University, Parbhani. The government is giving approval to set up a maize research center on government land in Sillod, Aurangabad.
The objectives of the Research Centre are as follows:
1. Collect the different genetic material (germplasm) of maize crop and develop hybrid varieties which give more yield.
2. Production of bio-fortified varieties.

3.Create disease resistant varieties.
Developing improved farming technologies.
Development of integrated pest and disease management technologies.
6. Exploring and demonstrating improved technologies to farmers.
7. To make farmers aware of the multi-utility (industrial use) of maize crop.
The necessary expenditure for the Maize Research Centre is being approved as follows.
Non-recurring expenses:
Machinery and Equipment (Rs. million).
