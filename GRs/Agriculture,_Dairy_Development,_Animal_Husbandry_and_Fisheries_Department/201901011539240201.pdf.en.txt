Introduction: The National Agriculture Insurance Scheme was being implemented in the state from the Rabi season 1999 as per the guidelines of the Central Government. However, the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana is being implemented in a revised form from Kharif season 2016 by discontinuing the National Agricultural Insurance Scheme. With a view to implement the scheme as per the guidelines of the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare has been empowered to take final decision on several important aspects like monitoring the implementation of the scheme, determining the areas and crops to be notified during each season, determining the risk level, determining the amount of insurance cover, deciding on the action to be taken on the selection of operational mechanism etc. taking into account the available data of crop production, area under the crop and the capacity to undertake crop harvesting experiments as per the prescribed numbers. The state-level crop insurance coordination committee headed by the chief secretary has been given the powers.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, insurance coverage is provided for crop-wise sown area in the state and the annual average production and marginal income (per hectare productivity) of these crops.

Crop insurance compensation is given based on the consideration. However, there have been several complaints regarding the lack of transparency in the process of determining crop productivity in the insurance sector based on traditional crop harvesting experiments. Therefore, in order to implement this scheme effectively and transparently, the project has been implemented on a pilot basis with the help of Maharashtra Remote Sensing Solutions Center, Nagpur (MRSAC), an autonomous organization affiliated to the state government, using modern technology, especially satellite imaging and drone technology, to accurately calculate the crop-wise area of the state and to estimate the yield after harvesting of the concerned crops by conducting health surveys of the cultivated crops on a regular basis.
3. The State Government is also implementing a mega project to set up automatic weather stations at every revenue circle level. Under this project, data will be available by collecting information about various weather factors, which will help in determining the compensation. Accordingly, the weather information required under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana will be provided to Skymet Weather Services Ltd. as per the terms and conditions of the mega project. This is being done by the agency.
4. Under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, the amount of insurance cover for crops to be notified in the State is kept as per the approved crop loan rate fixed by the committee appointed to fix the State level crop loan rate.
5. Accordingly, the revised guidelines of the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, vide Issue No. 35.2.1 provides for the State Level Crop Insurance Coordination Committee (SLCCCI) to be made effective by including all the concerned elements implementing the scheme from time to time in the committee. The State Level Crop Insurance Coordination Committee (SLCCCI), headed by the Chief Secretary, includes Maharashtra Remote Sensing Solutions Centre, Nagpur (MRSAC), Skymet Weather Services Ltd. The inclusion of representatives from the India Meteorological Department (IMD), as well as the State Level Bankers Committee (SLBC), was under consideration.
