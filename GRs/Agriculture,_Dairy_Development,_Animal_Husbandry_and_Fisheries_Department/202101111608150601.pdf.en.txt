Reference:- 1. Government Notification No. KRIBAS-0211/ PR No. 48/11-C, dated 12th June, 2012. Director (Sericulture), Directorate of Sericulture, Maharashtra State, Nagpur may be written to Secretary (Agriculture).

The Proposal:
The sericulture industry is an agro-based industry with huge employment potential and helps in raising the economic level of the people in rural areas. The geographical conditions and climate of Maharashtra are conducive for the silk farming industry. The recent changes in the climate can help the silk industry to avoid losses in agriculture.
Maharashtra is the leading non-traditional state in the country and produces two types of silk, mulberry and tussar (wild). In the state, cotton is grown in 27 districts.
The production of tussar silk is mainly done in four districts of Nagpur division, namely Gadchiroli, Bhandara, Gondia and Chandrapur. As per the provisions of Section 62 of the Maharashtra Agricultural Produce Marketing (Development and Regulation) Act, 1963, the Department of Cooperation and Marketing has approved the inclusion of silkworms in the schedule below Section 2 (1-A) of the Agricultural Produce and the Planning Department has given the status of" mulberry tree." Similarly, the Department of Agriculture has included" Silkworm Science" in Agricultural Universities and the subject is being taught as a" vocational course" in Agricultural Universities.
Agriculture is a subsistence industry. Silk cultivation (intercropping, manuring, feeding mulberry silkworms, producing silkworms from them and selling them, processing the silkworms to make cotton-like yarn and making cloth from the yarn, etc. In low rainfall areas, the production of mulberry is good, so mulberry cultivation is beneficial for increasing the income of the farmer. As a result, the area under sugarcane cultivation is increasing day by day. However, since silk is not included in the agricultural crop like other crops, the silk farmers do not get the benefit of the schemes applicable to other agricultural crops. As a result, many schemes implemented by the Department of Agriculture

GOVERNMENT DECISION NO. KRIBIK-2020/ P.No. 80/9-A,
Farmers have to suffer losses. In this background, the matter of recognizing the silk crop as an agricultural crop was under consideration.
Government Decision: Mulberry silk crop is being recognized as an" agricultural crop."
2. With the recognition of silk as an agricultural crop, mulberry silk crops will also get permissible benefits/ concessions like other agricultural crops. The Commissioner (Agriculture) should review the schemes applicable to agricultural crops by taking the opinion of agricultural universities on what benefits/ concessions are given to agricultural crops and to what extent mulberry silk crop also needs to be implemented. Also, a complete proposal with self-explanatory feedback on the name of the scheme, what benefits and how much mulberry silk needs to be applied to the crop, etc. should be submitted to the government. After the proposal is approved by the government, detailed orders will be issued regarding the amount of benefit/ concession permissible to mulberry silk crop like other agricultural crops.
