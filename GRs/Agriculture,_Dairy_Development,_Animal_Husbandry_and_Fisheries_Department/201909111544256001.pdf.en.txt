Preamble: In the line of various schemes implemented by the State Government for the overall development of Scheduled Tribes and backward classes i.e. tribal communities in the State, 13 new schemes have been launched for the overall development of Dhangar and similar communities belonging to the nomadic tribes-C and backward classes. The 13 schemes include one-time one-time grant-in-aid for purchase of land for semi-enclosed, captive sheep rearing or for renting land on lease agreement for 30 years under the State level scheme for landless shepherd families belonging to Dhangar and similar communities belonging to the Backward Classes of Nomadic Tribes-C.
2. Shepherds of Dhangar and similar communities belonging to the backward class of nomadic tribes (Bhaj-K) of the state roam at different places, rear goats and sheep and earn their livelihood. They have to face a lot of problems due to this.
For example, when they go on excursions, they go with the whole family, so their children do not have access to educational facilities. As a result, the illiteracy rate is high in this community. Lack of health care facilities affects the health of women and children. They do not receive financial compensation if their livestock dies due to reasons other than natural calamities. As a result, the borrower has to take a loan. The economic situation is getting worse.
Due to the constant wandering of this community, they have to stay away from the mainstream of society, depriving them of economic, educational and social progress.
In view of all the above, the Government was contemplating to introduce a new scheme to bring the Dhangar and similar communities belonging to the Backward Classes of Nomadic Tribes (BJ-K) into the mainstream. Accordingly, the government has taken the following decision:
