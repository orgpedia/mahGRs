Government Decision Number: MPV 2018/ PR No.20/ MPSU 3. The registration (mapping) of all the colleges under the university has been filled on the MAHADBT portal for filing on the mahadbt.gov.in portal. The online application process for the students has already started. Some students are facing difficulties in registering their applications on the MahaDBT portal. Further, since the colleges are facing difficulties in forwarding the complete application forms of the students to the University and the port is yet to be fully operationalized by the first semester of 2017-18, it has been observed that it will take some time to make the amount of scholarship, tuition fee, examination fee etc. provided to the students through the DBT portal as prescribed by the relevant Government decision by various departments. Accordingly, the Cabinet in its meeting held on 21/11/2017 has decided to delete the Central and State Government sponsored scholarship/ freeship schemes of various departments from the MahaDBT portal for the academic year 2017-18. The proposal was submitted through the Social Welfare and Special Assistance Department. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has given its approval for withdrawal of the Schemes of Department of Social Justice and Special Assistance, Department of School Education, Department of Tribal Affairs and Department of Minority Affairs from the MahaDBT system for the academic year 2017-18 and their implementation through off-line mode and transfer of benefits to Aadhaar seeded bank accounts. On the same lines, the Department of Higher and Technical Education has also issued a Government Decision dated 14/02/2018 regarding the exclusion of Rajarshi Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj Tuition Fee Reimbursement Scheme and Dr. Punjabrao Deshmukh Hostel Living Allowance Scheme from the MahaDBT Portal.
Accordingly, the government was considering to devise a procedure at the university level to provide Rajarshi Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj Tuition Fee Reimbursement Scheme and Dr. Punjabrao Deshmukh Hostel Maintenance Allowance Scheme to the students studying under Maharashtra Animal and Fisheries Sciences University through offline mode by excluding them from the MahaDBT portal.
The Maharashtra government has decided to disburse the benefits of Rajarshi Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj Tuition Fee Reimbursement Scheme and Dr. Punjabrao Deshmukh Hostel Allowance Scheme for the year 2017-018 to the students of Economically Weaker Sections (EBC) studying under Maharashtra University of Animal and Fisheries Sciences (MUFMS) through offline mode.
The procedure for giving this benefit in offline mode will be as follows: After accepting the application of the students in the level 1 college, the officer in charge of the concerned college, the Vidya Branch, should check the application and all the necessary documents and fill the necessary information in the application.
