Government Resolution No: Matsyavi-1117/ PR No. 147/ Padum-14,
The provision of mortgage of the incoming boat was made by the decision of the government dated January 2, 2014. However, the government has observed that the provision in this government decision has reduced the amount of repayment of loans of fishermen to a great extent. Also, as the loan and interest dues were pending to a large extent, it was necessary to revise the recovery policy as per the Government's 75% recovery criteria in this case to ensure regular supply of loans/ financial assistance to the needy and small fishermen. Therefore, due to the reduction in loan recovery, new conditions were under the consideration of the government to regularize the loan recovery.
Government Decision: While sanctioning financial assistance to the fishermen for mechanization of fishing boats under the National Cooperative Development Corporation Scheme, the Government is granting approval to mortgage the fishing boats concerned as per the terms and conditions prescribed for sanction of financial assistance vide Government Decision No. NDC- 2787/7271/ CR 42/ Fish-2, dated 28th March, 1988 and subject to the following conditions: 1. Mortgage of movable and immovable property of fishermen is required. Therefore, the loans can be recovered by force/ seizure under the Maharashtra Land Revenue Act, 1966 from the fishermen cooperative societies and their groups who have been deliberately keeping the dues.
2) Considering the loan amount and the repayment period, the diesel quota should not be granted to those institutions which do not recover 100% of the loan from the diesel refund to the fishermen as reimbursement of the amount paid on the purchase of diesel under the" Diesel Refund" scheme.
3) If the loan and interest are not recovered from the concerned group of the institution, then the institution should not be blacklisted and given the benefit of any government scheme.
4) The institutions come forward to take loans only due to the provision of the current government decision dated January 2, 2014 to recover the loans of cooperative societies and group heads. However, they are not providing the required support to the government representatives who come to recover the loan. They have also been asked to seize the boat. The fishermen are aware that the department does not have enough space to seize and secure the boat. Hence, the boat cannot be seized. As a result, the rate of interest on loans and loans is falling. Accordingly, this Government decision is being revoked by the Department of Agriculture and Padum, No: Matsyavi-1113/ PR No. 251/ Padum-14, dated January 2, 2014.
