Introduction: Fruit crops play a major role in the rate of growth of agricultural production. Farmers get better prices for their produce. However, if the expected yield is not achieved, the loss is huge.
Keeping this in mind, providing insurance cover to the farmers against climatic hazards will help in maintaining the financial stability of the farmers. The scheme is being implemented across the state.
Due to various climatic hazards there is adverse effect on the crop productivity and there is reduction in the production to a large extent. The farmers are facing financial crisis as they are not getting proper price for their produce. Considering all these factors, the government was considering to implement a restructured weather-based crop insurance scheme as a solution to get effective compensation to the farmers. The Restructured Weather Based Fruit Insurance Scheme is proposed to be implemented in 2019-20 for 7 crops viz., Orange, Cashew, Pomegranate, Mango, Banana and Grape (Ambia Bahar) in 30 districts with Revenue Circle component.
Government's decision:
The Government has decided to implement the Restructured Weather Based Fruit Insurance Scheme 2019-20 under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana for 7 crops namely Orange, Cashew, Pomegranate, Mango, Banana and Grape in Ambia Bahara. This scheme will be implemented in the Revenue Circle of the Taluk in the district mentioned in the Joint Letter-1 in the year 2019-20 as per the climatic hazard specified in the Joint Letter-2. The insurance company implementing the scheme shall provide the weather data recorded at the notified Reference Meteorological Centre (CMC) functioning under the Mega Project for the notified insurance sector units mentioned in Annexure-I and

The compensation will be paid to the farmers by aligning the crop-wise criteria mentioned in Annexure-2.
The government will not be responsible for any loss.
Objectives of the scheme: 1. To provide insurance cover to the farmers in case of loss of fruit crops due to natural calamities and adverse climatic conditions.
2. Maintaining financial stability of farmers even in the most difficult situation of crop loss.
Encourage farmers to use innovative and improved machinery technology and materials.
4. To ensure continuity of credit flow to the agriculture sector so as to achieve the objectives of food security, crop diversification and accelerated growth and competitiveness of the agriculture sector besides protecting the farmers from production risks.
Salient features of the Scheme: 1. The Scheme is for notified fruit growers in the areas notified under this Order.
2. Restructured Weather Based Fruit Insurance Scheme is mandatory for loanee farmers for notified crops in notified areas and optional for non-loanee farmers.
3. Farmers cultivating on lease or in addition to the account holders for the notified fruit crops in the notified area are eligible to participate in the scheme.
Under this scheme, insurance premium will be charged at a realistic rate and the insurance premium paid by farmers has been limited to 5 percent to reduce the burden of insurance premium on farmers.
3) The risks involved in the project.
The notified crops, type of insurance cover (weather hazards), duration of insurance cover, amount of cover, trigger and amount of compensation will be as mentioned in Annexure-II.
The notified crops for Aambia Bahar 2019-20, the weather risks involved and the period of insurance cover have been determined as follows and the compensation will be paid to the insured farmers after the implementation of the specified weather risks.
