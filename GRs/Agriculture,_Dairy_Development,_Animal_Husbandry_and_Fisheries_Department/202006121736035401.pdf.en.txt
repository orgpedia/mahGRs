Introduction: Fruit crops play a major role in the rate of growth of agricultural production. Farmers get better prices for their produce. However, if the expected yield is not achieved, the loss is huge. Keeping this in mind, providing insurance cover to the farmers against climatic hazards will help in maintaining the financial stability of the farmers. The scheme is being implemented across the state. Due to various climatic hazards there is adverse effect on the crop productivity and there is reduction in the production to a large extent. The farmers are facing financial crisis as they are not getting proper price for their produce. Considering all these factors, the government was considering to implement a restructured weather-based crop insurance scheme as a solution to get effective compensation to the farmers. Restructured Weather Based Fruit Insurance Scheme In 18 districts for 6 fruit crops namely Orange, Apricot, Pomegranate, Chikoo, Guava and Lemon in Mirg Bahara and in 23 districts for 8 fruit crops namely Orange, Apricot, Cashew, Pomegranate, Mango, Banana, Grape and Strawberry on pilot basis in Ambia Bahara, the Board of Revenue has been approved under the said Reference 8 to implement this component. District No. It is proposed to implement the scheme in the remaining 7 districts of the 2 districts with the revenue board component in Mrig and Ambia Bahara.
Government Decision: Restructured Weather Based Fruit Insurance Scheme under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana for three years 2020-21, 2021-22 and 2022-23 for District Group No. The approval is being given to apply for 6 fruit crops of orange, musumbi, pomegranate, chiku, guava and lemon in Mrig Bahara and 7 fruit crops of orange, musumbi, cashew, pomegranate, mango, banana and grapes in Ambia Bahara in 7 districts of Beed, Aurangabad, Akola, Sangli, Wardha, Thane and Hingoli. The scheme is being implemented in the three years 2020-21, 2021-22 and 2022-23 in the Revenue Circle of Talukas in the districts mentioned in Annexure-I as per the climatic hazard specified in Annexure-II.
