Preamble: The livestock rearers and farmers of the state are engaged in animal husbandry related employment and self-employment. The dangerous epidemics occurring among the cattle/ buffaloes/ sheep/ goats/ poultry and other domestic animals cause illness or death in the livestock and adversely affect the production. For the diagnosis of diseases like measles, diphtheria, PPR, salivary gland and bird flu in poultry birds and Ranikhet, etc., disease samples have to be submitted to the State Level Disease Diagnostic Unit, Aundh, Pune. This leads to wastage of time in disease diagnosis and in turn leads to delay in control of mortality in livestock and financial loss to the livestock farmers. There are 7 Regional Disease Investigation Laboratories functioning at Pune, Aurangabad, Nashik, Chiplun, Akola, Nagpur and Kolhapur for the diagnosis of animal diseases. In order to avoid financial loss to the livestock farmers, the existing state-of-the-art and prevalent RTPCR technology and the equipment required for it need to be strengthened by providing it to the departmental level Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratories. Therefore, to help the zonal veterinary institutions to control epidemics by accurate and short term diagnosis of these dangerous epidemics in livestock and poultry birds and to avoid financial losses to the livestock and poultry farmers. In the 29th State Level Project Sanctioning Committee Meeting held on 10th May, 2021 under the National Agriculture Development Scheme, strengthening of 4 Regional Disease Detection Laboratories at Nashik, Akola, Kolhapur and Chiplun in the State for RT-PCR testing of livestock diseases and testing of livestock under the National Agriculture Development Scheme (NADS) was approved.
