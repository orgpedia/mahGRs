c) Each cell in an Academic level is at 3% higher than the previous cell in that level.
d) The Index of Rationalization (IOR) is 2.67 for present AGP less than Rs.10, 000 and 2.72 for the AGP of Rs.10, 000 and above.
e) The entry pay of pre-revised and revised for each level is as follows:

20.0. Sixth Pay Commission for Teachers of Agricultural Universities in Maharashtra was made applicable vide Government Resolution dated 18.03.2010 at ref-1. However, it was amended vide ref-12. By this amendment (corrigendum) emoluments to the Associate Professors were paid in excess due to misinterpretation of some provisions of the pay commission. The excess payment of the said emoluments was cancelled and recovery was initiated vide Government Resolution dated 24.08.2018. The aggrieved Associate Professors have challenged this Government Resolution regarding cancellation of the Excess emoluments in Hon'ble High Court. Furthermore, Hon'ble High Court has stayed the resolution for recovery of excess payment. The issue of excess payment to the petitioners is pending before the Hon'ble High Court. As further extending the 7th pay commission would necessarily involve refixation of pay-scale, It is therefore decided to await decision of the Hon'ble High Court regarding implementation of the 7th pay commission to the teachers involved.
21.0 Procedure to be adopted by the Universities:
As per the provisions of the Maharashtra Agricultural Universities Act 1983,
Universities are primarily responsible for ensuring equitable and quality education in their

"In case it is found that any excess payment has been made on account of incorrect
