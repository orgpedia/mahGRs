1 As per the decision of the Government dated 25.2.2019, the Chief Minister's Animal Health Scheme has been launched in the State to provide veterinary services to the veterinary patients in remote, hilly, tribal dominated areas of the State as well as in the areas where the number of veterinary clinics is less compared to the livestock, as well as in the areas where there are inadequate communication facilities, to the doorsteps of the livestock farmers.
(ii) By connecting the nearest talukas of the neighbouring districts, irrespective of the administrative boundaries of the districts, it will be possible to provide veterinary services to the cattle rearers of such taluks. Therefore, if there is a border of another district near the taluka, if there is a need for livestock farmers in that nearby taluka, the mobile veterinary team cannot reach there. In view of this fact, considering the geographical proximity of the districts without considering their administrative boundaries, the matter of connecting the nearest talukas to the mobile veterinary team working under the Chief Minister's Animal Health Scheme was under the consideration of the government.
Government's decision:
The Government has decided to expand the scope of mobile veterinary teams working to provide veterinary services to the livestock farmers at their doorsteps under the Mukhya Mantri Pashu Swasthya Yojana.
