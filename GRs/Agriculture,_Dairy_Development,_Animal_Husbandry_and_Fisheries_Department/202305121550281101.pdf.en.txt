The Proposal:
The registration of ground water fisheries cooperative societies is based on the criteria laid down by the Fisheries Department in the contractual policy for pond/ reservoir fishing and the provisions of the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960 and Rules, 1961. The Department of Cooperation under the 97th Constitutional Amendment has adopted a policy to bring about a qualitative change in the functioning of cooperative societies. Considering the representations made by the people's representatives and fishermen's organizations to incorporate the above changes in the work of fisheries cooperative societies and to bring coherence and uniformity in the policy of the Department of Fisheries and the policy of registering the Groundwater Fisheries Cooperative Society (Primary) on the reservoir and the Groundwater District Fishermen's Union, the following government decisions have been issued from time to time in accordance with the organization registration criteria. As on 03.07.2019, the revised Government Order has been issued superseding all earlier Government Orders. The, however. Due to the provisions of the Government Decision issued under 03.07.2019, such as no fresh registration of a registered society on a lake/ water body, prohibition of registration of more than one society on a newly transferred lake/ water body, etc., there are 292 existing fisheries cooperative societies in the State, which are registered on the basis of their existing registration.

Government Resolution No. Matsyavi 2016/ PR No. 171 (Part III)/ Padum 13 No. of ponds reported in the bye-laws. However, in the by-laws of some of those institutions, there are records like the name of the village, the name of the taluka, etc. instead of the register of the lake. There are 189 fishermen co-operative societies in the state which have more than one pond. Whereas there are 106 lakes on which more than one organization has been registered. On the other hand, the number of lakes that have not been given to any organization is 386. As a result, some of the existing fisheries cooperative societies in the state do not have permission to register on more than one water body, while the fishing community does not get permission to register on that water body only because they live more than 10 km away from the water body. Further, the condition that the residence of the aggrieved person should be within a radius of 10 km in case of formation of a cooperative society for self-development with a common objective does not permit the socially and economically disadvantaged sections to register on the lake/ water body only on the ground that they live at a distance of more than 10 km from the water body.
Moreover, due to the distance limit on registration of institutions in the government decision and the fact that only one institution is registered, the reservoir is not being fully utilized and the increase in fish production is being hampered. Due to the policy of registering a single institution on the lake, there is also an increase in court cases by increasing the number of appeals/ revision applications and since it is not possible to register another institution, the inefficient institutions on the lake concerned do not even try to reform themselves. Alternatively, natural resources such as lakes/ reservoirs are also being damaged.
The continuity required in agricultural activities is not required in case of fisheries, but in the definition of active fisherman, the only means of livelihood of the fisherman should be fishing, this definition is confusing and also prevents the use of manpower in the fisheries sector to develop other alternative means of livelihood. In the modern times, the experiments done in agriculture using modern technologies like vertical farming, hydroponics, aquaponics and the demand made by the fish farmers/ fish farmers of the state to give the status of agriculture equivalent to fisheries, if the farmers are kept away from fisheries, then there may be technical difficulties in giving the status of agriculture equivalent to fisheries.
In addition, the definition of active fishery includes fishing and allied activities.

Even if people educated in modern technology want to register a cooperative society, the institution cannot be formed.
As per the definition of Active Fishermen, two types of registration of freshwater fisheries societies have been provided: 1) Primary Ground Water Fishermen Cooperative Societies 2) Fishermen Various Working Cooperative Societies Primary Ground Water Fishermen Cooperative Societies These fishermen can also work in various working cooperative societies. As a result, no" Fishermen Miscellaneous Working Cooperative Societies" have been formed since 2017. In addition to d. The provision in the Government Order dated 03.07.2019 disqualifies persons belonging to Multipurpose Organizations from the contract for the supply of raw materials for their value added projects. Therefore, it is necessary to remove the confusion in the definition of active fishermen and remove the technical difficulties, legal difficulties that have arisen due to this.
The reason It was under consideration of the Government to rectify the lacunae in the Government decision dated 03.07.2019 and bring the traditional Bhoi, Kahar, Dhiwar, Koli fishermen into the mainstream by giving them opportunities through fish trade from the reservoirs created by the Government, as well as to increase the production capacity of the ponds/ reservoirs by using modern technology and to make fisheries more industry friendly and inclusive.
Government's decision:
The Government, by this decision, supersede the earlier decisions of the Government and based on the provisions and norms of the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960, it is approved to fix the following revised criteria for the registration of the Groundwater Fisheries Cooperative Society (Primary) on the pond/ reservoir for fisheries, the Groundwater Fisheries Cooperative Union to be formed on the reservoir of 2000 hectares and the Groundwater District Fisheries Cooperative Union.
Active Fishermen: A person who is engaged in active fishing/ aquaculture, a farmer/ aquarium holder with seven names, a project victim whose agricultural land has been acquired for irrigation facilities, an active beneficiary of the scheme of the Department of Fisheries, a diploma and graduate in fisheries science and a person who is engaged in fisheries-related activities such as fish sale, marketing, research, value addition, import-export, net making, etc. should be called an active fisherman.
