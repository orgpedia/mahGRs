Mantralaya, Mumbai- 400 032
Date: December 21, 2018
Read: Govt. :- Matsyavi- 1118/ PR No. 75/ Padum 14, D. 11.05.2018
The Proposal:
There are many rare species of sea turtles, dolphins, sharks and other species.
The species is protected under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.
Fishermen also try hard to rescue them as many such species are caught in the nets of fishermen while fishing. But sometimes fishermen do not try to release such species back into the sea because the fishermen's nets are damaged. Therefore, in order to protect the marine species, the Government was contemplating to provide compensation to the fishermen against the loss of their fishing nets if they release such rare species by tearing/ cutting their nets in order to release such rare species caught in the fishing nets.
Government Decision: In order to protect marine species, if a fisherman rescues a rare species by tearing/ cutting his net to rescue such rare species caught in the fisherman's net while doing his fishing, then the fisherman will be compensated for the loss of the rare species by paying Rs.
25,000/- will be provided by the Mangrove Cell of the Chief Conservator of Forests, Onion Forest Department subject to the following terms and conditions.
Terms and Conditions: 1) Application for grant of boat owner's name and full address 2) Name and number of boat 3) Fishing license

In order to create awareness among the fishermen about the protection of rare species in the sea, the Mangrove Cell at the level of Assistant Commissioner Fisheries should go to the Fishermen Cooperative Society in 2 months and train them on the protection of rare species, for which the cost per training will be provided by the Mangrove Cell.
A state-level workshop should be organised jointly by the Fisheries Department and the Mangrove Cell to create awareness among fishermen about protecting rare species in the sea.
