Introduction: In many cases in the jurisdiction of the Animal Husbandry Department, there is no provision to file an appeal or review petition against the decision taken by the field offices. You have to go to court. Therefore, many unnecessary court cases arise in the field offices/ zonal offices as well as at the government level. Such court cases lead to unnecessary filing of affidavits, which is a waste of time for the government and the field offices.
2. In view of the above facts, the matter of making provision for appeal and review in the cases under the jurisdiction of the Animal Husbandry Department where there is no provision for appeal or review to the aggrieved person in the Acts, Rules, Regulations and Government decisions was under consideration of the Government.
