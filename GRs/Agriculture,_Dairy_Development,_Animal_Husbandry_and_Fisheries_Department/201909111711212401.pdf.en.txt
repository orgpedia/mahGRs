Introduction: The World Bank assisted Maharashtra Competitive Agriculture Development Project (MACP) was implemented in Maharashtra from 2010 to 2018. The main objectives of the project were to increase the productivity, profitability and ease of market access of the farmers in the state. Under this project, Farmer Producer Companies were established, Agricultural Produce Market Committees, Animal Markets, Rural Weekly Markets were strengthened and godowns were renovated. Similarly, poverty alleviation activities were carried out through various livelihood components under the Maharashtra State Rural Livelihood Mission (MSRLM). The Mission has empowered 2.20 lakh SHGs, created 7000 micro-entrepreneurs by setting up 5177 rural societies and 220 cluster level societies. Through the various Externally Aided Projects (MACP/ MSRLM etc.) implemented earlier in the agriculture and allied sectors as well as the existing schemes, the State has been able to mobilize the farmers and build their capacity in the field of value addition. More than 2000 Farmer Producer Companies (FPOs), 3.56 lakh women Self Help Groups (SHGs) and their associations have been formed through which value addition is done on various farm commodities.
As a result of the efforts made by the State Government through all these projects/ schemes, the social capital and infrastructure being created in the State, the need for planned and coordinated efforts has been felt to ensure that the farmers get maximum profit from agriculture by taking advantage of the opportunities in the domestic and global markets. In general, women have a significant participation in labour and similar low-level work in the agricultural sector, but the participation of women at the upper levels of the agricultural value chain needs to be greatly increased.
