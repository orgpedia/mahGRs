Preamble: As per the Government Resolution dated 24th July, 2018," Administrative approval has been accorded for implementation of the scheme for bringing the area under sugarcane crop under micro irrigation. As per para 9 of the said Government Resolution, the Centrally Sponsored Micro Irrigation Scheme under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana- Per Drop More Crop component is to be discontinued for the sugarcane crop in the areas where the scheme is being implemented to bring the area under sugarcane crop under micro irrigation. However, considering the actual methodology to be adopted for implementation of the scheme, it may not be possible to implement the scheme during 2018-19. Considering the drought situation in the state, the government was considering a proposal to exempt the farmers from this provision for the year 2018-19 so that the farmers in the areas where this scheme is planned to be implemented should not be deprived of the benefit of micro irrigation.
Government's decision:
1. under reference. In the Government Order dated 24th July, 2017, No. For the year 2018-19, exemption is being granted from the provision of closure for sugarcane crop under the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Micro Irrigation under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana- Per Drop More Crop component in the area where the scheme is being implemented for bringing the area under sugarcane crop under micro irrigation.
