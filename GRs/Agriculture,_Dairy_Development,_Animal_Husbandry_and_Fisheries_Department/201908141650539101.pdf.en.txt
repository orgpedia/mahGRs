Introduction: Chemical fertilizers, insecticides, fungicides and weedicides are widely used for the further production of cereals and hybrids and other crops. As a result, the ecological balance is disturbed and the soil is destroyed. This affects the health of animals and humans alike. Also, the use of chemical fertilizers deteriorates the texture of the soil. This has increased the cost of transportation. Also, you have to spend a lot of money to buy chemicals.
As a result, farmers are suffering and the cost of production is rising.
Organic certification of farm produce produced through organic methods, primary processing, market chain, formation of group groups will help in getting the right price along with the market for farm produce. This will reduce the cost of production of farmers, increase net profit and double their income in three years. For this purpose, the Dr. Punjabrao Deshmukh Organic Farming Mission is being implemented in the state under the state-sponsored organic farming/ poison-free farming scheme.
The scheme will be implemented from 2019-20. The administrative approval has been given as per the government decision. In 2019-20, Rs. 1000.00 Lakhs (Rs. Only Rs. ten crore has been earmarked for this.
