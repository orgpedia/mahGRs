4. To ensure continuity of credit flow to agriculture sector, which will help in achieving the objectives of food security, crop diversification and accelerated growth and competitiveness of agriculture sector, besides protecting the farmers from production risks.
2.Yes the salient features of the scheme are: 1. The scheme will be applicable only to the notified crops in the areas notified under this Order.
2. Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana is voluntary for loanee as well as non-loanee farmers.
Farmers who are cultivating the notified crops in the notified area on lease or lease in addition to the account holders are eligible to participate in the scheme.
Under this scheme, the increased premium subsidy burden will be on the state government for the crops in the district for which the insurance company has not paid the realistic premium rate of more than 30 percent. To reduce the burden of insurance premium on farmers, the insurance premium to be paid by farmers has been limited to 2 per cent for Kharif season, 1.5 per cent for Rabi season and 5 per cent for Kharif and Rabi season cash crops.
Under this scheme, the risk level for all notified crops has been fixed at 70% for three years- Kharif season and Rabi season 2020-21, Kharif season and Rabi season 2021-22, Kharif season and Rabi season 2022-23.
The threshold yield of the notified crops in the notified area shall be determined by taking into account the risk level of the crop whose average yield of the last 7 years is multiplied by the average yield of the last 5 years. The threshold income will be constant for the entire period of 3 years and the premium rate offered by the insurance company will also be constant for the entire period of 3 years.
7. Risk Factors: The following are covered under the scheme.
7.1 For Kharif Season- 7.1.1) Prevented Sowing/ Planting/ Germination of Crops due to Adverse Climatic Conditions 7.1.2) Mid Season Adversity in Crop Season 7.1.3) Reduction in Crop Yield during the period from sowing to harvesting due to natural fire, lightning, hailstorm, storm, cyclone, flood, inundation of area, landslide, drought, rainfall, pests and diseases etc.

| Cash crops         | Cabbage, kharif onion (2)                                                      | Onion.                                                                                |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The summer rice crop has been notified for the notified area in the state, for which the threshold income and the average income of the current year have been determined by assuming rice.
4.Value Added Insurance Premium Rate and Subsidy: Under this scheme, the premium will be charged at a realistic rate and will remain constant for 3 years.
However, the rate of premium per hectare to be paid by all farmers for Kharif and Rabi seasons is as follows.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| A.A.                          | crops                                                        | Insurance premium to be paid by farmers                      |
| Kharif season                 | Rabi season                                                  |
| 1                             | Crops and cereals                                            | 2% of the sum insured or the actual rate whichever is lower. | 1.5% of the sum insured or the actual rate, whichever is lower. |
| Cash crops (Kapus and Onions) | 5% of the sum insured or the actual rate whichever is lower. | 5% of the sum insured or the actual rate whichever is lower. |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Under this scheme, the difference between the crop-wise premium per hectare and the actual premium to be paid by the farmers will be considered as the rate of normal premium subsidy. The central share of the insurance premium subsidy has been capped under the new amendment. As per the existing guidelines of the Central Government of the scheme, the remaining amount after deducting the farmer's share of the minimum insurance premium rate received through e-tendering was being given to the insurance company by the State and Central Government in equal proportions. However, as per the revised guidelines dated 28.02.2020 of the Central Government, the ceiling on Central share of premium subsidy will continue to be applicable. As per the revised guidelines of the Central Government, the Central Government will pay 30 per cent to the crops of dry districts and 25 per cent to the crops of horticultural districts. The State Government's premium subsidy to the insurance companies will be paid through the Agriculture Insurance Company of India (AIC) in various stages as per the procedure prescribed by the Central Government under the guidelines of the scheme.
5.Value Protected Amount and Crop Insurance premium to be paid by the Farmers: Under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, the crop-wise insurance cover amount has been fixed for the year 2020-21 in the state as per the crop loan rate generally fixed by the District Level Crop Loan Rate Committee. Similarly, crop loan rates vary from district to district and in some districts, crop loan rates have been approved at higher rates than the rates fixed by the State Crop Loan Rate Committee. In this regard, the crop loan rates of the districts where the rates are higher than the rates fixed by the State Crop Loan Rate Committee have been reviewed.

The State Level Crop Insurance Coordination Committee has notified crop wise insurance sector components taking into account the average yield of the last 5 years of the highest yield of the last 7 years, area under the crop and the available manpower to carry out adequate crop harvesting experiments in the current season. In doing so, major crops in all the districts of the state have been included. The required number of crop cutting experiments have been planned as per the standard method of estimating yield for all the notified crops.
At present, 12 crop harvesting experiments are planned at the Revenue Board and Revenue Board block level.
Accordingly, while the Revenue Board or the Revenue Board is planning the crop harvesting experiment at the regional level at the block level, the District Collector of the concerned district is being given the freedom to plan the crop harvesting experiment at the gram panchayat level for at least 12 crops. The Collector should plan the crop cutting experiments for the notified crops in the notified area for crop insurance as per the prescribed method in accordance with the available resources, manpower at the local level. Crop insurance should be used to calculate the average productivity of all these crop harvesting experiments to determine the average productivity of the notified crop of the notified area.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, crop harvesting experiments are conducted using satellite images to obtain accurate and time-bound estimates of the yield obtained from crop harvesting experiments, and state-of-the-art techniques for crop yield estimation, e.g. The central government has suggested the use of drones (Dynamic Remotely Operated Navigation Equipment), smartphones, etc. Accordingly, pilot projects should be taken up at the State level by Central Research Institutions.
With a view to obtain accurate data in a transparent manner, it has been made mandatory to use the mobile app developed by the Central Government for crop harvesting experiments under this scheme. No other system/ app should be used for crop harvesting experiments. Recommended for Crop Harvesting Experiment

7.3. Standing Crops from sowing to harvesting: Comprehensive insurance cover will be provided against crop yield loss due to unavoidable risks such as drought, rainfall, flood, inundation of area, widespread infestation of pests and diseases, landslides, natural fire, lightning, storm, hailstorm and cyclone.
