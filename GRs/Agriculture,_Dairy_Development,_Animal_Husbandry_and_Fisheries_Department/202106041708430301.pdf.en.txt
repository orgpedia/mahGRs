The Proposal:
As per the 20th Livestock Census of 2017, the total number of breeding cows and buffaloes in the State is 89.04 lakh, out of which on an average 47-48 lakh cows and buffaloes are being fed with artificial sand every year. On an average, 12 to 13 lakh calves are produced every year from these artificial sands. The work of this artificial sanding is done by 4,847 government artificial sanding institutes under the Animal Husbandry Department, cooperative milk unions of the state, artificial sanding centers of non-governmental organizations and private artificial sanding traders. The average number of calves is 50 per cent male and 50 per cent female.
In Maharashtra. The complete ban on cow slaughter has been implemented since March 4, 2015.
Also, with the increase in modern technology and mechanization in agriculture, it is useful for agricultural work.

The need for horses has decreased. Therefore, the cattle rearers are forced to incur unnecessary expenditure to rear the extra male calves born through artificial insemination. Also, despite the average annual rainfall in the state of Maharashtra, there is a 40 percent shortage of dried tea and 60 percent shortage of green tea. Due to the male calves having to be reared, the milch animals are deprived of fodder and this is adversely affecting their milk productivity, despite the genetic potential of the milch animals. Against this backdrop, in order to keep the production of male calves at a minimum level, instead of the traditional semen, the semen produced using the new state-of-the-art technology of sex-determined semen production, which is used in the field level in cows and buffaloes under the artificial sanding program, will be able to produce 90 percent of female calves. The average price of the drug is Rs. 1,000/- to Rs. Since the amount of semen per sex was so high, there was no enthusiasm among the herders. Despite adopting this technology from a private source for some time, it was not possible to use artificial sanding in cows and buffaloes at the regional level.
Maharashtra Livestock Development Board has been given the responsibility of producing and supplying sex-determined semen. As per the Will dated 24.05.2019, Genus Breeding India Pvt. Ltd. (ABS India) has bid Rs. 766/- per sex determined semen, since the rate is minimum, their tender should be accepted. The Board has entered into an agreement with the concerned company on 13.09.2020.
The Maharashtra Livestock Development Board has negotiated with Genus Breeding India Pvt. Ltd. (ABS India), which produces sex-determined semen. 575/- per sex has been reduced. However, the rates will be applicable after procuring a total of 6.80 lakh sex-determined sperm from the concerned institution in the first, second, third, fourth and fifth years at the rate of Rs. 0.75 lakh, Rs. 1.25 lakh, Rs. 1.50 lakh, Rs. 1.60 lakh and Rs. 1.70 lakh respectively, over a period of five years. Otherwise, the rate is Rs. 596/- respectively.
During 2018-19, the Central Government has sanctioned Rs. A sum of Rs. 47.50 crore has been sanctioned.
Of this, 60 per cent will be funded by the Centre. 28.50 crore and 40% State share of Rs. 19.00 crore. At present, there are two sex determination laboratories in the state.
Considering the fact that the Department of Animal Husbandry has set up a new laboratory for the production of sex-determined semen and considering the cost of production of sex-determined semen, it is requested to grant approval for the production and purchase of sex-determined semen through an agreement with Genus Breeding India Pvt. Ltd. (ABS India). The semi-official letter of this department here. 11.11.2019 to the Central Government. Read on to No. 6 of the Central Government. As per the letter dated 21.01.2021, a total of 6.80 lakh sex-determined semen has been approved for procurement under this programme over a period of five years. Total Rs. 2959.00 lakh is required of which the Central Government will provide Rs.
