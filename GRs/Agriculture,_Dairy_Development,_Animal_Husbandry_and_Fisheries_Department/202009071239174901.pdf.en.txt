Considering the difficulties faced by the farmers from turmeric cultivation to processing and sale, the government was considering the formation of a study committee to advise the government on turmeric research and processing policy. Accordingly, the following decisions are taken:
Government Decision: A' Study Committee' is being formed under the chairmanship of Mr. Hemant Patil, Member of Parliament, Hingoli Lok Sabha Constituency, to determine the turmeric research and processing policy considering the difficulties faced by the farmers from the cultivation of turmeric crop to processing and sale.
