Office Memorandum of the Ministry of Finance, Government of India F. No.1 (13)/ PFMS/ FCD/ 2020, d. March 23, 2021 2 Government Circular No. SAMPRI 2021/ Q.No.35/ KOSHA PRASA-4, Dy. 1/07/2021 3 Government Circular No. Narrow 0919/ P.No. 221/14-O, Dy. 4/11/2020 Proposal:
From the year 2020-21, various flagship schemes of the Agriculture Department for individual benefit of farmers are being implemented through Maha-DBT portal. Through this integrated computer system, the benefit of all the schemes is being provided to the farmers through a single application. Further revised instructions are being issued in line with the revision of the suggestions in some aspects of the Circular in the context of the experience gained in the last one year and in view of the difficulties being faced at the field level.
Circular:
Some of the schemes of the Agriculture Department are for specific seasonal crops (pulses, millets, cereals, cotton, etc.) but the crops planted by the farmers are yet to be recorded on the 7/12 th line.
Similarly, it has also been observed at the field level that some crops, especially seasonal vegetable crops, are not recorded on the 7/12 scale.
In such a case, the farmers should submit a self-declaration on a plain paper about the cultivation of the concerned crop and this self-declaration should be considered to qualify the beneficiary in the scheme. The concerned officers/ staff should not reject or send back the applications of the farmers due to lack of record of the concerned crop on 7/12 th while scrutinizing the applications.
Earlier, the farmers were given the facility to make changes in the application form without any fee till the last date of submission of the application form (omission of selected items or inclusion of new items in the application form), now this facility will be available to the farmers even after the last date of submission of the application form.
Similarly, farmers who have applied for the subjects for which they have not been selected will not have to apply again, the application for these subjects will be automatically accepted for the next year.
