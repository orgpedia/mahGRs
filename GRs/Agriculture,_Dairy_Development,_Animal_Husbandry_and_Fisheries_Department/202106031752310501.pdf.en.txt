Introduction: It is necessary to make quality seeds of newly developed more productive varieties available to the farmers of the state in time to increase agricultural production. In order to make seeds available to the farmers, it is necessary to make available the required quantity of seeds in the production chain (breeder-base-certified seeds). Due to less availability of breeder seeds, the production of certified seeds is affected and due to lack of availability of certified seeds, the farmers have to depend on the seeds of truthful seeds or straight varieties available in the market, which affects the productivity of crops and in turn reduces the production of farmers. In order to have adequate availability of certified seeds, sufficient quantity of breeding seeds needs to be produced. Since the responsibility of producing the seeds lies with the agricultural universities, there is a need to develop an accountable and transparent procedure for the production of these seeds.
Circular: The following instructions have been given to the growers regarding the method of seed production.
The production of productive seeds will be the responsibility of all agricultural universities and institutions affiliated to them in the state. Agricultural universities need to plan for this.
In addition to the breeder seeds, the agricultural university should focus on the production of breeder seeds without paying much attention to the future of the foundation/ certified/ certified seed products.
2. The university which has developed the varieties of a crop shall scientifically produce the seeds of the respective varieties under the supervision of the concerned crop breeder. It will be mandatory for the university to supply seeds of hybrid varieties.
3. The Nucleus Seed of the respective varieties is expected to be prepared by the respective University for production of seed. Detailed record/ accounting of basic seeds should be maintained by the Agricultural University. The Director of Research should regularly verify that the detailed record/ registration of Nucleus seeds has been done by the Agricultural University.
The agricultural universities are informed by the central government about the production of seeds, and the demand for seeds from Mahabiz, National Seed Corporation and Farmer Producer Company (FPO) is also made to the agricultural university. The agricultural university should collect all these demands and determine the demand for seeds produced according to each crop and variety. Mahavij, Rashtriya Bij Nigam and Farmer Producer Company (FPO) have demanded the seeds for next year's kharif season at least two months before the start of this year's kharif season i.e. by 15 April.

It should be registered with the university and a copy of it should be given to the Commissioner of Agriculture. The concerned agricultural university should collect the crop-wise and variety-wise demand of the seeds produced and report it to the Agriculture Commissionerate.
Considering the demand received from the agricultural universities, it should be decided how many varieties of seeds are to be produced according to the variety.
5. When the breeder is producing seeds, the seeds fail the germination test, resulting in a reduction in the production of the breeder's seeds. Since the agricultural university has been producing seed for many years, the area of seed production should be increased accordingly by estimating what percentage of seeds generally fail the Germination Test. Take additional programs in the summer season as needed.
For example, if 100 quintals of seed is to be produced and 50 per cent of the seed has failed the germination test, then 150 quintals of seed production should be planned and accordingly the area to be planted should be determined, so that finally the seed obtained in all the processes is available as per the demand.
While registering the demand for seeds, the concerned Mahavij, Rashtriya Bij Nigam and Farmer Producer Company (FPO) should deposit 20% advance against the seeds to the concerned universities. Agricultural universities should supply seeds as per demand or registration. If the seeds are not available as per the demand registered due to natural calamities and other reasons, the Agricultural University is required to supply minimum quantity of seeds in the form of advance paid by the respective companies. However, Mahavijan should be provided with the seed on priority as per their demand.
7. New varieties of different crops developed by each university for different regions need to be propagated while registering the demand for seeds. For this, the Agriculture Commissionerate should pay special attention to the fact that the demand for seeds of new varieties will be recorded while registering the demand from Mahabiz, National Biz Corporation and Farmer Producer Company (FPO). The agricultural university should also review the production and demand of seeds of new varieties and take up a program of seed production of new varieties to some extent and make these seeds available to the farmers under the extension program to disseminate them to the farmers in their area. For this, the agricultural university should coordinate with different Farmer Producer Companies (FPOs) and try to propagate the newly developed varieties through them. It will be mandatory for the concerned agricultural university to supply the seeds of the new varieties developed by the agricultural university.
After the registered breeder seeds are produced by the agricultural university, its lifting must be done by the relevant company in the same season. The advance paid by the company through which the seeds will not be lifted should be seized by the agricultural university.
9. The Agricultural University should plan to take care of the production of seeds for oilseeds and pulses also so that sufficient quantity of seeds of new varieties under the Pulses and Oilseeds Programme is available under different schemes. For the availability of seeds of pulses and oilseeds (excluding soyabean) every year, the Agricultural University has appointed Mahavij, National Seed Corporation and

Care should be taken to ensure that there is careful planning for seed production in coordination with the Farmer Producer Companies (FPOs).
The role of Farmer Producer Companies (FPOs) is very important for the availability of newly developed forest seeds in the area expansion of pulses (Kulith, Pavata and Val), oilseeds (Karadai, Jowar) and green crops, paddy, jute etc. Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) can play an important role in increasing the area under cultivation of these different crops among the farmers in their area of operation. In order to increase the availability of certified seeds of these varieties, agricultural universities need to enter into mutual MoUs with Farmer Producer Companies (FPOs) in their area, and undertake seed production programmes for these varieties.
In the case of soybean crop, the test of germination capacity should be conducted in the month of November after sowing the seeds as per the demand registered by the university last year. The university should plan to streamline the supply of seed to the growers by taking up seed production programmes during the summer season to fill the gap if the seeds are found unfit in the growing capacity in this trial.
The demand for the next year's rabi seeds for the crops in the rabi season should be registered with the Agriculture Commissionerate at least 2 months before the start of the current year's rabi season, i.e. by July 15.
13. The concerned seed testing laboratory shall be bound to examine the seed samples for testing the germination capacity of the seedlings and report the same to the Agricultural University within 15 days from the receipt of the seed samples. Seeds must be tested in this period by seed testing laboratories. For this, if there is a need to make a separate Standard Operating Procedure for the seed testing of the growers, it should be prepared by the Agriculture Commissionerate so that the testing is done more carefully and strictly.
14. Producers After the production of seeds, some amount of seed becomes unfit for germination. Untimely rains or other natural calamities affect the production of seeds.
As a result, the final product is available in less quantity. Considering this fact, the university must produce more productive seeds than the demand/ demand. In this process, if more productive seeds are available than the target, then the seeds should be converted into true quality and made available to the farmers for sowing. Thus, to some extent, the cost of production of seedlings can be compensated.
15. Agricultural Universities should consider the possibility of producing seeds through Farmer Producer Companies (FPOs)/ Farmers/ Taluka Seed Farms if the University is constrained to develop seed fields on its own land due to shortage of manpower under the University in producing seeds and lack of irrigation facilities. For this purpose, the production of seeds should be ensured in sufficient quantity.
