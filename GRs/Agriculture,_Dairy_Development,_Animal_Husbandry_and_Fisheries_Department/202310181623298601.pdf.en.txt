Preamble: The Department of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, Dairy Development and Fisheries vide Government Resolution No.
FDR-2023/ S.No.39, D. As on 21.06.2023, administrative approval has been accorded for implementation of the scheme for implementation of 6 sub components under Fodder and Livestock Development Programme under District Annual General Plan. It includes a sub-component on" Distribution of Incentive Fertilizer Seeds for Fertilizer Production on Farmers Farm."
The total number of cattle and the average production of fodder and fodder in the state together account for about 44 per cent of the fodder deficit. The situation of fodder availability worsens if there is less than average rainfall.
There is a huge difference between the milk production capacity of milch animals at the country level and the milk production capacity of milch animals in the state. Adequate and nutritious feed is essential for the production of milk. Reducing fodder shortage is a key part of the strategy to increase milk production and the government should take a decision to attract livestock farmers towards fodder production to ensure adequate availability of nutritious fodder to livestock. The matter of increasing the amount of subsidy being given as on 21.06.2023 was under consideration of the Government.
