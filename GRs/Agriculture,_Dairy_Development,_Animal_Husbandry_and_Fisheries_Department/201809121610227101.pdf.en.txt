GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: SUSCINIO-2017/ PR No. 58/14 A
Madam Cama Marg, Hutatma Rajguru Chowk
Mantralaya, Mumbai- 400032
Date is September 12, 2018.
Reference: Government Resolution No: Susinyo-2017/ Q. No. 58/4 O, D. July 24, 2017.
Preamble: As per the Government Resolution dated 24th July, 2018, administrative approval has been accorded for implementation of" Scheme for Micro Irrigation of Area under Sugarcane Crops." Under this scheme, farmers are given loan up to Rs. 85,000 respectively. The interest rate on Long Term Rural Infrastructure Fund (LTRF) has been fixed at 5.50 per cent. The interest liability has been fixed at 1.25% for sugar mills, 2% for farmers and 4% for the state government, taking into account the surcharge levied by the state apex bank and district central apex bank.
The per hectare credit limit to be given to the farmers was considered as per the parameters of the expenditure limit fixed by the Central Government for the sugarcane crop under the micro irrigation scheme at that time. However, the cost parameters are modified by the Central Government depending upon the fluctuation in the price of micro irrigation materials. Accordingly, the amount of loan given under this scheme also needs to be changed. Similarly, the rate of interest on loan from NABARD for Long Term Rural Infra Fund (LTRF) was fixed as per prevailing rates. The division of interest liability has been decided taking into account this rate of interest. The interest rate on the long-term rural infrastructure fund provided by NABARD varies. Farmers need to be provided loans at the changed interest rates and the government's liabilities are expected to change accordingly.
Considering these factors, the limit of loan per hectare to be given to the farmers, the rate of interest on the loan to be made available to the farmers and the interest liability to be borne by the State Government, the sugar mills and the farmers are mentioned in paragraph No. The proposal to replace the amended provisions by excluding 5, 7 and 8 was under consideration of the Government. As a result, the following decisions were made:
