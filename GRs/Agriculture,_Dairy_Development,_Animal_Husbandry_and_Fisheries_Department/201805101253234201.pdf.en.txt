Introduction: Since October to March is the peak season for milk production, there is an increase in the production/ collection of milk. The excess milk produced during this period is converted into milk powder. This year also, the milk collection in the state has increased from October 2017 to March 2018 as compared to 2016-17. Also, the fall in the prices of milk powder in the national and international markets has led to an increase in the balance stock of milk powder at milk powder producing plants in the state. Therefore, the milk powder plant owners have reduced the conversion of milk powder. In order to ensure that this situation does not adversely affect the milk producing farmers and the excess milk produced in the state is accepted for conversion into milk powder, the project holders are required to pay Rs. The proposal for grant-in-aid of Rs 3 crore was placed before the Cabinet in its meeting held on May 8, 2018.
The Cabinet has approved the proposal and accordingly, for the additional milk to be accepted for conversion into milk powder, the project holders will be paid Rs. The proposal to provide such a subsidy was under the consideration of the government.
Government Decision: The Government has decided to provide Rs. The Government is approving the payment of such subsidy subject to the following terms and conditions.
The cooperative and private milk powder plant holders in the State who produce at least 20% more milk powder than the milk powder produced by them in the month of March, 2018, within a period of 30 days from the date of this Government decision, will be paid Rs. 3/- will be admissible as incentive.
The incentive subsidy will be admissible for a period of 30 days from the date of the decision of the Government.
The subsidy will be admissible for milk of 3.5 per cent fat and 8.5 per cent SNF or above.
