Creating, reducing production costs, increasing productivity, crop diversification, value chain
Strengthening farmers' income by promoting climate resilient and sustainable agriculture.
It is hereby approving the implementation of the following components for the purpose of enhancement.
(1) Supply of Rector Operated Wide Rainfed (BBF) Machines: -
Broad-bodied rainforest (BBF) is a climate change-friendly farming system. The use of this method
Currently being done across the state, the system is for crops such as soybean, gram, maize, groundnut.
It's useful. Hence, this approach should be used by the maximum number of farmers in the state.
Supply of 25,000 Rector Widespread Rain Water Harvesting Machines is being approved across the state.
(a) The purpose: -
1. Widespread Rainfall Fertility (BBF) sowing to compensate for excess / deficient rainfall.
Reducing the intensity.
2. Proper management of farm water.
3. To promote soil conservation and water conservation.
4. To promote sustainable agriculture by increasing the productivity of farmers.
b) Advantages of using a wide-brimmed machine: - 1. Crop loss is reduced by better drainage of excess water.
2. The soil moisture is retained if there is less rainfall as per water conservation in the soil.
3. The wind keeps on blowing, the trees grow well.
About 100 hectares can be sown in a season per wide rainforest (BBF). Accordingly, if 25000 BBF machines are supplied to the farmers of the state, then through that season in the state.
An area of 2.5 million hectares can be covered during the period, thereby reducing the seed use for the area to 30-40%.
5. It is possible to sow, fertilize, and prepare all the seeds at the same time.
6. Less labour is required, mechanisation makes it possible to do tasks on time and saves time and cost.

(4) To provide drones with the designation "Chief Minister Farmers Drone": -
There is ample scope for the use of drones in the agriculture sector and at present it is used for the growth of various crops.
In addition to spraying insecticides, micronutrients, soluble fertilizers, the state is associated with the agricultural sector.
It can also be used for other purposes. The use of drones has resulted in the use of laborers for agricultural work.
Shortage, time taken for agricultural work, inefficient spraying, water saving, physical distress, medicine
Various diseases caused to farmers by killing, spraying on tall crops, and unprofitable expenses.
It helps in solving problems. It also provides employment opportunities to farmers.
