(1) GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: RAPHYO-2018/ PR No. 47/9-O, dated 6th July, 2018 (2) Commissioner (Agriculture), Commissionerate of Agriculture, State of Maharashtra, Pune. No./ KRIYA/ PLO-1/ IFS Scheme/ 3050/2018, dated 29/11/2018.
Preamble: Under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, only" Small and Marginal Landholding Farmers holding Job Cards and Farmers belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes" are eligible for subsidy up to an area of 2 hectares for cultivation of orchards. As a result, 80% of small and marginal farmers in the state were ineligible to get subsidy for cultivating orchards under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme as they did not have a' job card'. In view of this, a new scheme" Bhausaheb Phundkar Fruit Garden Plantation Scheme" has been implemented in the state from the Kharif season of 2018-19. Paragraph 3 of this Government decision states that the period of cultivation of fruit trees under this scheme will be from May to November every year.
However, this year due to drought-like situation and delay in implementation of the scheme, the farmers could not cultivate the orchards during the stipulated period. Therefore, the request to extend the period of cultivation of fruit trees under this scheme was being made by the Commissionerate of Agriculture through the letter No. 2 read above as well as from various levels. Considering this, the matter of extending the time for planting the fruit orchards was under consideration.
Government's decision:
The Government is approving extension of date for cultivation of Fruits under" Bhausaheb Phundkar Fruit Garden Plantation Scheme" for one year i.e. 2018-19 only till 31st March, 2019.
