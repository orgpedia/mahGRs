Preamble: In order to reduce the reticence of the employees of the State Government due to non-availability of promotion opportunities, the time-bound promotion scheme was implemented as per the decision of the Government dated 8th June, 1995 in reference No. 1.
On the same lines, in order to reduce the reticence of Group C and D (Class III and IV) employees in agricultural universities, affiliated agricultural colleges, agricultural schools and rural educational institutions due to non-availability of promotion opportunities, a time-bound promotion scheme has been implemented under the Government decision dated 21st September, 1999 in A.No.4. Under this scheme, the eligible employees of the then Veterinary, Dairy Technology, Fisheries Science College and Animal Husbandry Department of the Agricultural University were given benefits.

In the meantime, the Government has established the Maharashtra University of Animal and Fisheries Sciences at Nagpur in the year 2000 and under the Government Decision dated 2nd July, 2001, the reference No.5 has been transferred to the Maharashtra University of Animal and Fisheries Sciences along with the then Veterinary, Dairy Technology and Fisheries Sciences Colleges and Departments of the Agricultural University and the posts of teaching and non-teaching staff here.

Now, as mentioned above, a proposal was under consideration of the Government to implement the In-service Assured Progress Scheme implemented under the Government Decision dated 20th July, 2001 in the context No. 6, for non-teaching staff under the control of the Maharashtra University of Animal and Fisheries Sciences. The proposal has been approved in the Cabinet meeting held on 7th August, 2018. Accordingly, the government has taken the following steps:
