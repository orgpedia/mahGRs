The comparative position of milk production in respect of milch animals in the State of Punjab, which is the leader in milk production in the country and in the country, is as follows.
(L/ day)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Types of dairy animals | The level of the country | Punjab | Maharashtra |
| the indigenous cow     | 3.36                     | 9.17   | 2.34        |
| Hybrid cow             | 8.52                     | 13.88  | 10.38       |
| buffalo                | 5.96                     | 9.56   | 5.33        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
On the basis of the above information, the production capacity of the cattle of the state is almost double than the state of Punjab. Therefore, there is a lot of scope to increase the productivity of milch cattle in the state. In order to increase the milk production capacity of the cattle, along with the health of the animals, the animals also need a balanced and nutritious diet.
Under normal rainfall conditions, there is 44% deficit in green fodder and 25% deficit in dry fodder.
(Attention. ton).

| Harvi Bairan       | 1334.13                 | 747.38                     | 586.75           | 43.98              |
| Dried rice         | 425.77                  | 321.05                     | 107.72           | 25.12              |

Considering the decreasing area under fodder crop cultivation in the state, the number of livestock and fodder produced, it is more likely to occur during times of scarcity than during normal rainfall conditions. The Central Government vide its letter No. R- 24018/26/2023-DIR ANLM (E-25776) has requested to constitute a" State Level Task Force" to suggest measures. This was done on 06/09/2023.
