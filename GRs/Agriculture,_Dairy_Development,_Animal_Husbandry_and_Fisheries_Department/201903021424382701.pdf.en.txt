Under this mega agritech project, approval is being given to develop systems for various modules mentioned in Annexure-C.
While developing this system, an integrated computer and mobile application system for accurate advice and guidance to farmers should be developed by combining information from various computer systems developed by different departments of the government (Mahavedh, Mahamadat, CropSap, Soil Moisture, Soil Health Sheet, Jalyukt Shivar, Crop Insurance, Mahabhoomi, Ground Water Survey, Fruit Garden Survey, Soil Retention Maps- Cadastral Maps, Land Records, etc.). For this purpose, all necessary support from various departments under the government should be provided to Maharashtra Remote Sensing Centre, Nagpur (MRSAC) and National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC-ISRO), Hyderabad.
Under this project, in the year 2019-20, an information system will be developed for the districts of Wardha, Buldhana, Ahmednagar, Osmanabad, Parbhani and Kolhapur with the help of a satellite providing high resolution data with a resolution of 5 meters or less and for other districts with a satellite providing medium resolution data with a resolution of more than 5 meters. Similarly, in 2020-21, six more districts in addition to the above six districts should be selected in consultation with the Commissioner (Agriculture) and an information system should be developed for these 12 districts with the help of satellites providing high resolution data with a resolution of 5 meters or less. Thereafter, from 2021-22 onwards, an information system with the help of satellites providing high resolution data with a resolution of 5 meters or less should be developed for all the districts of the state every year.
At least 2 villages in each district should be covered in a phased manner by collecting data through drones and using it to develop the proposed system. In addition, a system to assess the damage caused by localized disasters with the help of drones should also be developed under this project within a prescribed time frame. The cost is Rs. 4 crore from the savings on other aspects of the project.
Before developing the system as per Annexure-C for providing all information up to the Minimum Revenue Circle through Maharashtra Remote Sensing Solutions Centre, Nagpur (MRSAC) and National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC-ISRO), Hyderabad, it is first required to ensure that the facility is not developed by Mahalanobis National Crop Forecasting Centre (MNCFC), New Delhi so that there is no duplication.
Under the Nanaji Deshmukh Krishi Sanjeevani Project (POCRA) under the Department of Agriculture, a similar idea will be implemented on a pilot basis for Yavatmal and Beed districts in 2019-20. POCRA to develop an information system for the entire State by processing the satellite images to be taken under the Maha-Agritech project as suggested by the High Level Committee (HPC).
