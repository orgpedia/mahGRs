Maharashtra State Seeds Corporation Limited (MAHABIJ), Akola vide letter No. MAHABIJ/ PRODUCT/ 2017/575 dated 23/10/2017.
Maharashtra State Seeds Corporation Limited (MAHABIZ), Akola vide letter No. MAHABIZ/ PRODUCT/ 2018/972, dated 27/03/2018.
Letter No. Prodn of National Seeds Corporation, Divisional Office, Pune. 80/ NSC-PNA/ 2017-18, dated 27/03/2018.
The Proposal:
Maharashtra State Seeds Corporation Limited (MAHABIJ), Akola and National Seeds Corporation, Pune produce certified and quality seeds from the farmers of the state every year and make them available to the farmers of the state at affordable prices in the next season. Maharashtra State Seeds Corporation Limited (MAHABIJ), Akola and National Seeds Corporation (NSPC) have issued a procurement policy to the eligible farmers for the seeds produced by them as per the" average rate of maximum price per day in the respective district during the given period plus 20-35% incentive amount depending on the variety of crop and seed quality" and accordingly payment is made to the farmers. An important component of this seed procurement policy is the" Agriculture Produce Market Committee Rate," and for the last 2 years, there was an enthusiastic response from the farmers to this seed procurement policy, which facilitated the production of targeted seeds by the government and the supply of certified seeds to the farmers of the state.

At present, since the maximum market price of almost all the crops in the Agricultural Produce Market Committee is less than the Minimum Support Price (MSP), the farmers are demanding the minimum support price instead of the rate in the Agricultural Produce Market Committee and the corporation's pre-announced 20 to 35 percent incentive on it. Due to this, the corporation is facing difficulties in determining the fair price for the sale of seeds and if the seed purchase rate is given according to the minimum base price and the incentive amount on it, the farmers will not accept expensive seeds due to the increase in the sale price of seeds and the corporation will have to bear the financial burden by leaving a large amount of seeds. Also, it will have an adverse impact on the seed replacement rate in the state and it can also adversely affect the overall production of the farmers and reduce the productivity and production in the state.
There is a huge difference between the market price and the minimum support price (MSP) for tur produced in Kharif season 2016, but the procurement price was given to the farmers according to their demand. When the standard seed sale price was fixed for Kharif season 2017 based on this procurement price, farmers did not buy seeds at the said price. As a result, the Maharashtra State Seeds Corporation Limited (MAHABIZ), Akola, had to bear a huge financial burden due to the non-allocation of about 25,000 quintals of tur seeds. If this situation continues every year, the corporation will be in loss and the Maharashtra state will not be self-sufficient in seed production.
For some crops in 2017-18 (e.g. Moong, Urad, Tur, Groundnut) The rates of Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) and the rate of incentive payable by the Corporation are likely to be lower than the MSP. The farmers are demanding minimum support price (MSP) for their produce and a hike in the remunerative price announced by the government.
For example, the base price of Moong crop is Rs 5575/- per quintal and the market price is between Rs 4000 to Rs 4500/- per quintal. Assuming an average maximum price of Rs. 4250/- per quintal, the total procurement price of certified quality seed will be between Rs. 5100 to Rs. 5300/- per quintal with an incentive of 20/25%. Due to the huge difference between the market price and the minimum support price this year, the farmers are not ready to give the seeds produced to the corporation and will sell the seeds to the government at the minimum support price (MSP) and there is a strong possibility of shortage of seeds of various crops in the state from next year.
5. Since it is not possible to maintain a reasonable seed sale rate compared to the increased seed purchase price for crops like Moong, Urad, Tur, Soybean, Paddy, Wheat, Groundnut, etc. and the profit margin is negligible, the private seed producing companies do not carry out the seed production programme of such crops on a large scale. It is the responsibility of the corporation to ensure the availability of such seeds.

Every year the corporation is given the target of the power generation program by the agriculture commissionerate.
However, due to the possible financial losses to the corporation, the production of such varieties will have to be stopped, which may lead to a shortage of seeds in the state. In such a situation, private seed companies will take advantage by buying seeds at a lower price and selling them to farmers at a higher price.
This is because private companies have sold seeds to farmers at higher rates than usual during the seed shortage that occurred during some natural disasters in the state.
As an alternative, the Maharashtra State Seeds Corporation Limited (MAHABIZ), Akola, vide letter dated 23/10/2017, has proposed that the Government should pay the difference between the Minimum Support Price (MSP) declared by the Central Government for crops like Moong, Urad, Tur, Paddy, Soyabean, Groundnut, Wheat, etc. in the State through the Maharashtra State Seeds Corporation Limited (MAHABIZ), Akola, and the average rate of maximum rate in the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) during the period as per the Corporation's declared procurement policy. Doing so will help the power producers to get the procurement price at the maximum rate as per the notified procurement policy of the Corporation along with the incentive amount and will help them to continue their participation in the power generation programme. Also, the difference amount can be credited to the Aadhaar linked accounts of the farmers through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT). For this, the district-wise list of farmers producing seeds, the fixed rates based on the Agricultural Produce Market Committee rates as per the pre-announced seed procurement policy of the corporation will be communicated by Mahabeej, Akola and National Seeds Corporation, Pune (NSC).
7. The production programme of certified seeds or foundation seeds of any crop is undertaken by Maharashtra State Seeds Corporation Limited (MAHABIJ), Akola and National Seeds Corporation, Pune as per the targets given by the Commissionerate of Agriculture. Electrification programme is taken up in more than one district in the State. The amount paid to the seed producing farmers against the certified/ foundation seeds produced is calculated based on the average rate of the maximum price per day during the crop-wise prescribed period of the 3 major Agricultural Produce Market Committees of the respective districts. This average varies from crop to crop depending on the harvest and market arrivals during the prescribed period. For seed production, 20-25% incentive is given for standard seeds and 30-35% for foundation seeds at the average market price as considered above.
If the maximum daily rate of the crop in the district-wise prescribed period is less than the MSP, then the government is proposed to provide a subsidy to pay the difference to the farmers. The subsidy will be given for certified and foundation seeds. In such a case, the difference in MSP will be given to Maharashtra State Seeds Corporation Limited (MAHABIZ) Akola and National Seeds Corporation, Pune as incentive subsidy and it will be deposited in the bank accounts of the seed producing farmers through direct benefit transfer.

In the states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, seeds are also purchased according to the seed production program procurement policy. In the year 2017-18, due to the huge difference between the market price and the minimum support price, the state government is providing 33 to 40 percent seed distribution subsidy to the seed producers of the state on the basis of minimum support price. Therefore, the power generation programme in the State has stabilized and farmers are also getting certified/ foundation seeds at affordable prices.
The Telangana State Corporations provide seed procurement rates to their seed producers along with Minimum Support Price plus 20% incentive, based on which their seed sale rates are determined. The state government is paying 35 to 37 per cent subsidy on the sale price of seeds through its own scheme and farmers are getting seeds at affordable prices.
At present, the maximum market price of almost all crops in the Agricultural Produce Market Committee is less than the minimum support price (MSP), due to which there is a huge difference between the market price and the minimum support price this year, and the farmers are not ready to give the seeds to the corporation. Therefore, there is a possibility of shortage of seeds of various crops in the state in the coming years. In this regard, the government was considering to implement a new scheme to pay the difference between the Minimum Support Price (MSP) announced by the government and the price based on the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) within the prescribed period to the farmers producing seeds through the Maharashtra State Seeds Corporation Limited (Mahabeej), Akola and the National Seeds Corporation, Pune.
Government's decision:
The maximum market price of almost all the crops in the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) is less than the Minimum Support Price (MSP), due to which there is a huge difference between the market price and the Minimum Support Price (MSP) this year. Therefore, there is a strong possibility of shortage of seeds of various crops in the state from next year. In this regard, if the minimum support price (MSP) declared by the government for certified and basic seeds produced in the state of Maharashtra is higher than the market price based on agricultural income in the prescribed period, then the difference between this amount is being implemented through Maharashtra State Seeds Corporation Limited (Mahabeej), Akola and National Seeds Corporation, Pune. The scheme will be applicable for payment of difference between the quantity of seeds produced during Kharif and Rabi seasons 2017-2018 and 2018-19 onwards.
2. Maharashtra State Seeds Corporation Limited (MAHABIZ), Akola and National Seeds Corporation, Pune submit the consideration of the amount due to the seed producing farmers to the Commissionerate of Agriculture, Pune
