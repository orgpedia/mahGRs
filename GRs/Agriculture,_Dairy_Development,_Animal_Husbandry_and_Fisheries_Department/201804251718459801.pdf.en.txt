Introduction: Fruit crops play a major role in the rate of growth of agricultural production. Farmers get better prices for their produce. However, if the crop does not yield the expected yield, the loss is also huge. Keeping this in mind, providing insurance cover to the farmers' fruit crops against climatic hazards will help in maintaining the financial stability of the farmers. The scheme is being implemented across the state. Due to various climatic hazards there is adverse effect on the crop productivity and there is reduction in the production on a large scale. The farmers are facing financial crisis as they are not getting proper price for their produce. Considering all these factors, the government was considering to implement a restructured weather-based crop insurance scheme as a solution to get effective compensation to the farmers. The Restructured Weather Based Crop Insurance Scheme is proposed to be implemented in 25 districts for 5 crops viz., Orange, Pomegranate, Guava and Chikoo (Mrig Bahar) by adopting Revenue Boards as a component. For this, the revenue board must have a productive area of at least 20 hectares of notified fruit crops.
Government Decision: Under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), the Government has approved the implementation of Restructured Weather Based Crop Insurance Scheme 2018-19 for 5 crops viz., Orange, Moong, Pomegranate, Guava and Chikoo in Bihar. The scheme will be implemented in the Revenue Circle of the Taluk in the district mentioned in the Joint Letter-1 in the year 2018-19 as per the climatic hazard specified in the Joint Letter-2.
