The government circular issued the following instructions to take strict action against boats fishing with LED lights.
1) The maritime patrol should be effectively carried out in the maritime waters of the state through maritime patrol vessels.
Stringent action should be taken against fishing boats violating the Maharashtra Marine Fishing Regulation Act, 1981 by fishing mechanized boats of the state and fishing mechanized boats of the state in the maritime waters of the state.
3) District-wise maritime patrol report every Monday. The e-mail of the Minister (Fisheries) should be sent to: shaikh. aslam@nic.in by the Assistant Commissioner Fisheries and Regional Deputy Commissioner Fisheries, Mumbai Division, Mumbai.
Also, a press note should be prepared and published every month regarding the action to be taken by the department to sustain sustainable fishing so that everyone is aware of the action.
The report is submitted to the Designated Officer and Tehsildar under Section 16 of the Maharashtra Marine Fishing Regulation Act, 1981. In this regard, the Assistant Commissioner of Fisheries of all the concerned marine districts should submit the details of the time-wise, pending cases, how many times the marine law has been violated by the concerned vessel in the past, how many times the report has been filed on that boat in the past, how the report has been filed on that boat in the present situation, how many times the fine has been paid, whether the fishing license has been cancelled before this or not, to the Office of the Commissioner (Fisheries).
The Assistant Commissioner of Fisheries of all the marine districts should propose action to the concerned Designated Officer regarding maximum punishment as per Section 17 (1) (a) (b) (c) and Section 17 (3) (a) (b) of the Maharashtra Marine Fishing Regulation Act, 1981, on priority against the Persisin fishing boats fishing with the help of LED lights.

7) In view of the action taken by the department on the boat, action is taken on the boat when the boat is going to sea/ standing in the port. At such times, it is observed that since there are no fish on the boat, they impose a very low penalty. Therefore, the rate of filing a report by auctioning the fish on the boat that is caught while coming to the port after fishing and violating the maritime law should be increased so that the vessel can be punished more under Section 17 and strict action under the maritime law will create fear among the fishermen.
8) After hearing the complaint filed under section 16 to the adjudicating officer and the tehsildar, if the tehsildar has imposed a lesser penalty under section 17, it should be informed to the Regional Deputy Commissioner of Fisheries, Mumbai. In this regard, a letter should be sent to the concerned District Collector through the office of the Regional Deputy Commissioner Fisheries, Mumbai.
9) The above instructions should be strictly implemented by all the concerned authorities. The Commissioner, Fisheries should take strict action against the concerned officials who are hell bent on taking action against the fishing mechanized boats violating the provision of Maharashtra Marine Fishing Regulation Act, 1981.
