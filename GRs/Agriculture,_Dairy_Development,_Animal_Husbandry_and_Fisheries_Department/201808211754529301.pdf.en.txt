Read:- 1) The date of the Government Decision in the Government Schedule is July 20, 2018.

3) Commissioner, Dairy Development, vide letter No.Aduvi9/ Milk Procurement Rate/ Subsidy/ 2018/1204 dated 6.8.2018.
The Proposal:
The Government has decided to provide an incentive subsidy of Rs.50/-per kg and Rs.5/-per litre to cooperative and private milk powder plants for export of milk powder and liquid milk in the State under the Government decision at Reference No. 1. Under the same decision, it was also decided to provide a subsidy of Rs.5/- per litre for conversion of the remaining 3.5/8.5 (cow milk) quality milk excluding packaged milk produced in the state, subject to certain conditions. Thereafter, effective implementation of the scheme will be effective from 31.7.2018. In the presence of the Minister (Padum), a meeting was held with the cooperative and private dairy project owners of the state, which was discussed at length and accordingly, a revised government decision was issued in accordance with the government decision at No. 2 in the context. The scheme will be implemented from August 1, 2018.
As per the decision of the government in the above context, the government has approved a reduction of 30 paise per 1 point less fat in the milk procurement price; however, the cooperative and private organizations of the state have raised the issue that there is no mention in the government decision about the reduction in the price for SNF per point less.

In view of the facts reported in the letter and the effective implementation of the scheme, it was under the consideration of the Government to fix the rate of reduction for SNF per point.
Government's decision:
The government has decided to implement the scheme in the state.
To be fair, the state is allowing a reduction of Rs 1/- for every 1 point less SNF of the remaining milk excluding packaged milk. In view of this approval, it will be mandatory for the cooperative and private institutions to provide quality milk rates as mentioned in the table below. This price will include the government subsidy of Rs 5/- per litre.
