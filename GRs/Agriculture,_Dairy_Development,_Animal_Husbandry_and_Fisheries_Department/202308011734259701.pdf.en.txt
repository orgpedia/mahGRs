The proposal:
In order to promote fisheries in the landlocked areas of the State, supply of quality fish seed/ shrimp seed to fish farmers, fish breeders and fish farmers is essential.
For this, a total of 32 fish seed production centers, 32 fish seed conservation centers, 2 shrimp seed production centers and 1 shrimp seed conservation center have been established in the state. Since these fish seed centres are in a dilapidated condition and many of them are running at a loss due to their maintenance cost, establishment cost, daily expenses, etc. Under the government decision, a total of 6 centers were approved to be leased for 10 years. Also Read No. 3 Under the Government decision mentioned here, it was decided to lease out a total of 20 Government Fish Seed/ Shrimp Seed Production and Conservation Centres, 6 and 14 more, which were earlier leased out, for 15 years. Read above. Under the Government decision mentioned here, the time period for leasing out fish seed production/ conservation centres has been fixed at 15 years.
However, there was not enough response to let the fish seed centre run on lease as the time required for the repair of these established fish seed production centres and the income generated from it is less than the investment required and the lessee will not have any right over the infrastructure created at the centre and the centre after the expiry of the lease period.

Because of this, leaseholders do not invest large amounts for a short period of time. Due to this it is not possible to take the produce from the fish seed center as per the fixed production capacity. The extension of the period of leasing out of the Sub-Helps will enable the development of the centres and meet the fishing needs of the State. The government was considering extending the contract period of fish seed production centre and fish seed conservation centre to 25 years instead of 15 years.
Government's decision:
By the decision of the government,
1. the decision of the government. Fish Seed Production/ Conservation being provided as on 16.12.2022
It is being approved to increase the period of 15 years to 25 years for leasing out the centres.
All the government fish seed production centers and fish seed conservation centers in the state are 25 years old.
A lease is granted for a period of time.
(3) The decision of the Government. The Committee constituted under the Chairmanship of Commissioner Fisheries under 16.12.2022 will determine the eligibility and terms/ conditions required to develop the Fish Seed Centre.
4. The revenue generated by leasing out the said centres shall be fully credited to the Government first and thereafter the entire amount shall be budgeted and released under the head of accounts as prescribed by the Department of Fisheries. Separate action is being taken in this regard.
This decision was taken by the government in reference to the Finance Department's Informal Reference No. 495/2023/ Expenditure-2D. Issued with the consent received under 21/07/2023.
