Introduction: The Government is implementing the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme with the noble objective of making a slum-free Mumbai and alternatively a slum-free Maharashtra. Initially, due to demonetisation and the recent global pandemic like Corona, the financial condition of private developers has become fragile. As a result, the implementation of slum rehabilitation schemes is becoming financially difficult for private developers. In fact, it is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain the expected pace in the implementation of the rehabilitation plan. Therefore, the stages and rates of the excess to be recovered by the Slum Rehabilitation Authority should be fixed and the developers should be allowed to pay the excess free of cost. The decision to grant relaxation up to 31st March, 2021 is in reference no. 3 here. The decision has been taken in accordance with the Government Decision dated 22.09.2020.The extension of the said relaxation till 31st March, 2021 was under consideration of the Government.
Government Decision: Reference No. 3 here. Under the government decision of September 22, 2020, the developers have been given the right to pay the premium. Extends until March 31, 2021. It will be extended until September 30, 2021.
