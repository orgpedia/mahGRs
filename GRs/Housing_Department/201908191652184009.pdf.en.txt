The Proposal:
The Mumbai Development Authority (MDA) has decided to develop the areas of Worli, Naigaon, NaM Joshi Marg and Sewri in Mumbai. The decision to redevelop the chawls has been taken as per the decision of the government here (No. 1). Also read here A. No. 3) to 5) According to the decisions of the government here, Worli, Naigaon and Na. Competent Authority and Appellate Authority have been appointed for determining the eligibility of the beneficiaries for redevelopment of BDD chawls at Joshi Marg and other ancillary matters.
The redevelopment of BDD chawls in Mumbai is an ambitious project of the government. It has been observed that some of the residents of these chawls are opposing the survey of eligibility and are not giving the required response. A few months have passed since MHADA appointed the construction contractor through the global tender process, but the actual work has not yet started.
Therefore, in order to meet the target of completing the project in 7 years, the government was considering the formation of a high-level committee to control and review the project.
