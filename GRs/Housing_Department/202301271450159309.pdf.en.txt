The government had approved the release of the state share of funds under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) from the Maharashtra Shelter Fund. However, since the funds are not reflected in the PFMS system and the letter No. 4 of the Central Government has informed about the distribution of the State Account Fund from the State Budget Fund, the matter of the State Account Fund equivalent to the Central Account was under the consideration of the Government.
Government's decision:
875.58 crore (Rupees Five Hundred and Eighty Three Crores Seventy Two Lakhs only) of the State Account equivalent to Rs. 583.72 crore sanctioned under Orders 1 to 3.
It is hereby approved to allocate the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA) to distribute the enforcement agencies mentioned in order 1 to 3.
Under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban), the government had approved the release of only the state share of funds from the Maharashtra Shelter Fund (Extra Budgetary Resources). However, these funds are not reflected in the PFMS system and are not included in the Central Government's letter No. 4.
