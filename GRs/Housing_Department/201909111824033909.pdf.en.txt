As per the provisions of Section 76 to Section 103 of the MHADA Act, 1976, old and cessed buildings on the island of Mumbai are repaired and acquired under certain circumstances. Section 90 (1) of MHAD Act, 1976 provides for relocation of tenants/ occupants to transit camps owned by Mumbai Building Repair and Reconstruction Board in case of old cess buildings declared as dangerous or/ or beyond repair. Section 77 (b) of Section 8 of the MHAD Act, 1976 provides for demolition of the building beyond repair and relocation of the tenants/ occupants to the transit camp of the Board. Similarly, since 1977, the Mumbai Board has been providing temporary transit shelter to the residents of dangerous and dilapidated buildings as well as those who are beyond repair and collapse from time to time. The Mumbai civic body has a total of 56 quarantine centres in the city, with 21,135 beds. In the year 2010, the Mumbai Board had conducted an inspection of the residents living in the slums of all the transit camps. Eviction proceedings under the provisions of Section 15 (a) of Section 8 of the MHADA Act, 1976, were carried out by the Mumbai Board from time to time against the ineligible/ unauthorised occupants found in the said inspection. Subsequent investigations have revealed that as of the end of July 2013, about 8,448 slum dwellers in transit camps are ineligible/ unauthorised occupation. More than 21,000 residents are living in 56 transit camps across Mumbai and some of them have been living in transit camps for more than 40 years. Some of the original residents who lived in the old dilapidated building before the relocation have not even been rebuilt. In addition to the residents of the transition camp who had their previous

They have been living in transit camps away from their original places of stay for more than 30-40 years. They have become accustomed to the place by getting accustomed to the present location. Therefore, while redeveloping the transit camps, the matter of rehabilitating such residents in situ was under the consideration of the government. Accordingly, the Government have decided to: Government Decision In order to rehabilitate the unauthorised occupants of the transit camps of the Mumbai Building Repair and Reconstruction Board, after giving a comprehensive consideration, they have been categorized into the following three categories: a) The original occupants have been shifted to the transit camp, b) The kind of residents who have taken the right of the transit camp from the original occupants through a power of attorney or similar authorization letter, c) The kind of intruding residents who have taken unauthorized possession of the MHADA transit camps.
The authorized, ineligible, unauthorized (infiltrators) residents of the above mentioned' A',' B' and' C' should be rehabilitated in the redeveloped transit camps as follows:
(a) The original inhabitants who have been shifted to transit camps-
As the owner is the occupier as per the government order, he is allowed to live in the reconstructed building at the original place. In view of this, subject to acceptance of allotment of flats in the proposed reconstructed building, relocation of the said tenant to the buildings of the transit camp in which he is presently residing, in the same building where the transit camp is being redeveloped, will be done free of cost. However, it will not get any exemption from the rent/ maintenance charges that the occupier is currently paying to the Mumbai Repair Board. Also, the monthly fee to be paid in future in respect of the new House which has been rehabilitated, etc.
It must be paid. In addition, it will be mandatory for the concerned to pay all the dues to the MHADA authority in the period up to the re-allocation.

(b) The kind of residents who have taken the right of settlement in the transit camp from the original inhabitants through a power of attorney or similar authority.
Since the gaol holders of this category have made irregular/ illegal transactions through power of attorney or similar authorization letter by giving some monetary compensation to the original gaol holders and even if the transaction is illegal, they have paid some monetary amount in the transaction, therefore, from a sympathetic point of view, the gaol holders of this category should be recovered from them the amount of construction cost of the flat equivalent to the area of the gaol in the transit camp where they are currently residing and the infrastructure cost to be provided to the gaol. Thus, the construction cost, infrastructure cost should be recovered and the redistributed amount should be transferred in their name.
Stamp duty and any other applicable government charges will have to be paid by the tenant.
c) Such infiltrating residents who have taken unauthorized possession of the silt in MHADA transit camps
Even if the tenant in this category is a 100 per cent infiltrator, the tenant will still have to meet the basic conditions/ conditions of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (such as not owning a house in India, not having to pay Rs. 3/6 lakh production limit) A penalty of 25% on the amount of construction cost of the flat equivalent to the silt area in the transit camp where they are currently residing, the infrastructure cost to be provided to the rehabilitated silt and the amount of both these costs should be recovered from the silt holders.
Thus, the amount to be reallocated should be transferred to their names after recovering the construction cost, infrastructure cost and penalty. Stamp duty and any other applicable government charges will have to be paid by the tenant.
The rehabilitation of the bonded labourers belonging to both categories (b) and (c) as above shall, if possible, be done in-situ in the building to be developed at the site of the transit camp being redeveloped and if not possible, the bonded labourers belonging to the said category shall be rehabilitated in the same building.

It will be done at other available locations in the Brihanmumbai area. The occupants of these three categories will not get any exemption from the rent and maintenance charges currently paid to the Mumbai Repair Board/ concerned competent authority. Before taking possession of the place to be reallocated, it will be required to pay all the monthly charges, etc. payable in respect of the space currently occupied. The concerned tenant shall not be eligible for re-allotment of tenancy unless the above proceedings are completed.
4. MHADA should take action at their level to determine the eligibility criteria for all the above three categories of residents.
5. Since the benefit of government scheme is being given to these tenant farmers once as per the above rules, henceforth they will not be given the benefit of any kind of government scheme regarding houses. For this purpose, the allotment of land to the original landlord will be linked to his Aadhaar number.
Necessary amendments to the MHADA Act, 1976 in this regard shall be carried out separately.
