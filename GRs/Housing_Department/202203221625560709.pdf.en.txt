Introduction: The Government is implementing the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme with the noble objective of making a slum-free Mumbai and alternatively a slum-free Maharashtra. Initially, due to demonetisation and the recent global pandemic like Corona, the financial condition of private developers has become fragile. As a result, the implementation of slum rehabilitation schemes is becoming financially difficult for private developers.
In fact, it is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain the expected pace in the implementation of the rehabilitation plan. Therefore, the land to be recovered by the Slum Rehabilitation Authority should be given to the developers free of cost by fixing the stages of land acquisition and the rate in the ratio of 10:10:80. The decision to grant relaxation up to 31st March, 2021 is in reference no. 3 decisions have been made. Also, give it a discount. The decision to extend the deadline till September 30, 2021, was taken in Reference No. The decision has been taken in accordance with the government's decision.
Government Decision: The stages of the excess to be recovered by the Slum Rehabilitation Authority and the payment of land premium to the developers as per the rate fixed in the ratio of 10:10:80. Deliveries through September 30, 2021. It will be extended until September 30, 2022.
