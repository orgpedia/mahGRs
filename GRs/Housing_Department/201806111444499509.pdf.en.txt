Corrigendum: Under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, 1. The Government has decided to implement the project on Public Private Partnership (PPP) basis as per the Government Decision dated 11.01.2018. As per the decision, the selection of the developer and the land for the implementation of the project will be done through e-tendering process through MHADA and Urban Local Bodies/ Planning Authority. It has now been decided to continue the tender process for selection of land and developer without fixing the last date for the tender process till the demand for houses of the eligible beneficiaries from the concerned local civic bodies/ planning authorities is met. Accordingly, interested land owners/ developers can submit their land proposals to Urban Local Bodies (ULBs), MHADA or State Government through online or offline mode as per their convenience. The proposals submitted by them will be scrutinized by MHADA and the Mission Director will submit the proposal to the State Level Evaluation Committee within 15 days.
2) Under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY), the price of 50% of the eligible project houses will be fixed as per the prevailing price policy of MHADA as per the decision of the Government on Public Private Partnership (PPP) basis. The Government Resolution dated 11.01.2018 provides. The remaining 50% of the cost of the house is to be borne by the developer. In order to bring more clarity in this provision, it is now being proposed to amend the price policy of this house. Accordingly, the maximum cost of 50% of the eligible houses in the project under the PPP policy shall be the prevailing Market Price Rate Table (ASR) price in the area concerned or the price mentioned in the project proposal by the developer, whichever is lower.

That has to be determined. The remaining 50% of the cost of the house will be borne by the developer.
3) The state government has implemented the PPP policy. In the Guidelines issued on 24.01.2018, vide Para No. As per Model RFP 2.4, the EMD was to be determined by the respective Urban Local Bodies/ Planning Authorities. Now an amendment is being proposed in this regard, according to which the provision of paying the earnest money is being removed. Hence, Section No. 2.4 is also being completely eliminated as it is not required.
The above is an improvement. In the Government Decision dated 11.1.2018 and dt. As per the Government Circular dated 24.1.2018, the said amendments shall come into force from the date on which the said Government Resolution/ Government Circular is issued.
