GOVERNMENT DECISION, NO.:- COMPREHENSIVE-2020/ PR No. 338/ GRANIP
Madam Cama Marg, Hutatma Rajguru Chowk,
Ministry, Mumbai- 400 032.
Date: July 9, 2021.
Introduction: Various redevelopment projects are approved at the level of Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA) and its boards. No-objection certificates and letters of acceptance are issued to these proposals at the MHADA/ Board level itself. The Government/ MHADA has no control over such projects when they are actually redeveloped after issuance of no-objection certificates and letters of credit. Irregularities have been noticed in the redevelopment project, often in violation of the terms and conditions of the letter of credit. The brunt of such irregularities is mainly borne by the original occupants of the redevelopment project. Redevelopment projects are delayed for years and residents are deprived of their rightful homes for an indefinite period. Therefore, in view of the larger public interest, it was under the consideration of the Government to amend the procedure for grant of loan from MHADA for redevelopment. The following decisions have been taken in this regard:
Government Decision: Before giving the letter of credit for the redevelopment project of MHADA colonies and cooperative housing societies on MHADA-owned plots, the detailed proposal of that redevelopment project should be submitted to the government and the MHADA should proceed to give the letter of credit with the prior approval of the government.
2) The decision of the government. At the Cabinet meeting held on 23rd June, 2021. I. The order is being issued in accordance with the decisions taken by the Cabinet and the powers vested in the government under Section 164 (1) of the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Act, 1976.
