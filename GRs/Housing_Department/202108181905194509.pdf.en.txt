The Proposal:
The then Bombay Development Department (BDD), during the years 1921-1925, had constructed a number of buildings at Worli, Naigaon, Naigaon, Naigaon, etc. in Mumbai. A total of 207 chawls have been built on M. Joshi Marg and Sewri. Each chawl is of floor+ 3 floors and each has around 80 residential blocks. As well as B.D.
There are also slum-like construction stalls, shops, social/ educational institutions in the vicinity of D. Chali. As these BDD chawls are more than 96 years old, the Government has decided to redevelop them with the approval of the Cabinet. 1 here. These are issued pursuant to the Government Decision dated 30.03.2016.
2. In the B.D.D. chawls, some flats have been rented out to some government departments as retirement homes. Read No. 1 here. As per the Government decision dated 30.03.2016, after redevelopment of BDD chawls, the same number of rehabilitation flats are to be made available to the concerned Government Departments (Administrative Departments). In BDD chawls, service accommodation is provided to police personnel by the police department.
3. Providing accommodation to police personnel in the state is a sensitive issue. The number of police personnel in the state, especially in Mumbai, and the proportion of service accommodation available to them, is busy. The motto of Maharashtra Police is" Sadrakshanay Khalinigrahyay" and the police personnel perform their duties according to this motto.
If there is any disaster or crisis in the state, the police system is the first to rush to it.
Some police personnel have been living in BDD chawls for 2-2 generations. All of these things
