Government Resolution No. 2022/ No. 41/ DWPU-2
Madam Cama Marg, Hutatma Rajguru Chowk
Ministry, Mumbai- 400 032.
Date of release: June 29, 2022
Reference:- Government Letter, Parivartan-2022/ P. No. 41/ DWP-2, Dy. 28.06.2022 Preamble: As per the provisions of Section 76 to Section 103 of MHAD Act, 1976, old and dilapidated cess buildings in Mumbai Island are repaired and their land is acquired under certain conditions. When old buildings are declared dangerous or beyond repair, the tenants/ residents are shifted to transit camps under the Mumbai Building Repair and Reconstruction Board. Similarly, the Mumbai Building Repair and Reconstruction Board provides temporary transit shelter to the residents of dangerous, dilapidated buildings as well as beyond-repair, repair and collapse buildings from time to time. The distribution is done with the approval of the Joint Chief Officer/ DWP Board.
The occupants of these buildings are taken on the master list as they cannot be reconstructed in place of the buildings damaged due to narrow plots, reservation, provisions in the Development Control Rules, road widening, etc. in Mumbai city. However, it has been observed by the government that the original beneficiaries are still deprived of the benefits.
At present, the number of transit camps available with the Mumbai Building Repair and Reconstruction Board is low and the demand for them is high. Also, there is a need for empty transit camps, especially in South Mumbai, for transit camps. Therefore, the old eviction notice holder (d. 01.01.2018 earlier) will not be eligible for allotment of transit camps, therefore, such eligible eviction notice holders have the option to apply for grant from the broad list.

Government Resolution No: Parichay-2022/ No.41/ DWP-2
At present, the Mumbai Building Repair and Reconstruction Board (BMRB) is getting houses of different sizes through additional construction area under Regulation 33 (7) of the Development Control Regulations. The distribution of these houses is expected to be done to eligible persons in the larger list.
However, the board currently has 400 sq. There is less demand for houses of more than one feet size and the Board has to bear the cost of maintenance to prevent the deterioration of these slabs, which is a financial burden on the Board. Therefore, if the said period is made available by the Mumbai Building Repair and Reconstruction Board through sale through draw of lots through the Mumbai Board, the Mumbai Building Repair and Reconstruction Board will get additional revenue.
In view of the above, the Government is taking the following decisions:- (a) The number of transit camps available with the Mumbai Building Repair and Reconstruction Board at present is less and the demand for transit camps is more. Also, there is a need for empty transit camps, especially in South Mumbai, for transit camps. Therefore, the old eviction notice holder (d. No transit camps will be allotted to those (prior to 01.01.2018), therefore, such eligible eviction notice holders should apply to the Mumbai Building Repair and Reconstruction Board for getting exemption from the broad list. The distribution of the same should be done through online mode on 1st of every month.
(b) 400 sq. ft. of land presently available with the Mumbai Building Repair and Reconstruction Board. Bulbs of more than one feet size should be made available for sale through the Mumbai Board. The funds collected from this should be provided by the Mumbai Board to the Mumbai Building Repair and Reconstruction Board.
