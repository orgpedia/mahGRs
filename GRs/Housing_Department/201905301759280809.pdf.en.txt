Preamble: In exercise of the powers conferred on the Government under the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development (Allotment of Land) Regulations, 1982, vide Exchange No. 16 of 1982, for the distribution of residential/ non-residential plots of MHADA at Government level. The decision was taken by a Cabinet sub-committee headed by the Minister of Housing. It was established on April 1, 2017.
The revised policy of allotment and pricing of the remaining mat areas, breakaway plots, no breakaway or independently developable plots, recreation grounds, etc. to be sold for reconstruction to the cooperative housing societies in the existing old colonies of MHADA has been notified in MHADA Authority Resolution No. 6260, D. 4.6.2007 has been notified.
As per the said resolution, the Cabinet Sub-Committee shall be empowered to distribute the land in this regard. As per the Government Decision dated 23.05.2018. The said. 23.5.After passing the Government Resolution dated 2018, a proposal has been received from the State to allot a plot of land under the management of MHADA. Also, there are very few lay outs within the limits of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) where the area of MHADA's plot of land is more than 4000 sq.m. Hence, the government has very little scope to acquire such land. Therefore, since such proposals are received very little from the MHADA authority, it was under the consideration of the government to approve these proposals from the government level instead of placing them before the cabinet sub-committee.
