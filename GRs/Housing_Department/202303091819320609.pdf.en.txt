Government circular:
For getting the redeveloped flats of the slum dwellers under the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme, the Government has issued Notification No. 18/ No. 18/ Jhodni-2, D. 12.08.2021 and dt. The eligibility/ ineligibility is determined by the concerned competent authority as declared under 11.02.2022 and the corresponding records are recorded in Annexure-II. The slum dwellers who are found ineligible will be given the said compensation as per the provisions of Section 35 of the Maharashtra Slum (Improvement, Elimination and Rehabilitation) Act, 1971. 12.08.2021 and dt. Appeals can be filed with the Appellate Authorities declared under the Government Notification 1102.2022. Whether the Annexure-II submitted by the applicant or the appellant is valid/ true or not while disposing of the appeal filed before the Appellate Authority?
This needs to be verified. For this, a certified copy of Annexure-2 is required from the appellate authorities. But the appellants are not provided with the certified copies of Annexure-II by the competent authorities. Hence, they find it difficult to produce the certified copy of Annexure-II while filing an appeal to the competent appellate authority regarding the ineligibility of Annexure-II. Moreover, the slum dwellers spend a lot of time in getting the certified copies of Annexure-II and thus find it difficult to file the appeal before the Appellate Authority within the stipulated time.
2. Considering the above reasonable difficulty of the hut holders in obtaining/ furnishing the certified copy of Annexure-II, the same needs to be removed. For this, after preparing Annexure-II of eligibility/ ineligibility of hut holders, the certified copy of the same shall be made available to the concerned Appellate Authorities by the concerned competent authority within 8 days from the date of issue of Annexure-II.
