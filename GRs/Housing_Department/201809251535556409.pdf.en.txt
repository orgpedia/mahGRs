In 2005, the central government launched the Integrated Housing and Slum Development Programme (IHSDP) and the Basic Facilities to the Urban Poor (BSUP) under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Rural Livelihood Mission (JNNURM). As many as 1,75,032 houses were sanctioned in the state under both the schemes. Out of these, 1,39,635 houses have been completed and 22,764 houses are under construction. As many as 29,952 houses have not been distributed to the beneficiaries so far. The process of handing over the possession of these houses to the beneficiaries is still underway through the concerned enforcement agencies.
Therefore, the number of households that have not been given possession of the houses to the beneficiaries is likely to decrease in the future. However, it is likely to be inappropriate if the houses are left unused due to the fact that the houses are not being used even after the construction is completed. National property is also being damaged due to the unutilised houses. Both of these plans are time-consuming. expired on 31.3.2017. As a result, the central and state governments will not be able to provide funds for these schemes anymore. Therefore, the matter of providing these houses to the eligible people who are homeless due to various reasons through the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana was under the consideration of the government.
