| 2         | Rs 51 to Rs 250 crore  | 38000                                           | up to 1000                                                    |
| 3         | Rs 251 to Rs 500 crore | 75000                                           | Up to the year 2000                                           |

The selection of the developers who qualify the above criteria shall be done by the owner and tenant/ occupants of the building concerned. Also, it will be mandatory to issue a certificate of negligence by the Mumbai Building Repair and Reconstruction Board after verifying this qualification.
Also, if a developer has been given a no-objection certificate in a project and again submits a proposal to issue a no-objection certificate for a new project, then page 5 of 9

Government Resolution No: VIMANKA-2016/ PR No. 142 (Part-1)/ DUPU-1
The Mumbai Building Repair and Reconstruction Board should issue a no-objection certificate for the new project after checking the eligibility of the developer in the above-mentioned category, taking into account the rehabilitation period in all the projects carried out/ the status of the project.
2. Opening of Escrow Account in Redevelopment Scheme and advance of rent from the tenant/ resident by the developer.
The owners of the buildings receiving cess in the city of Mumbai and with the consent of 51% of the tenants/ residents of the building, request the Mumbai Building Repair and Reconstruction Board to appoint a developer for the redevelopment of the building and issue a no-objection certificate to that developer. Accordingly, a No Objection Certificate is issued to the developer by the Mumbai Building Repair and Reconstruction Board for the redevelopment of the building after checking the eligibility of the tenants/ residents of the building concerned. Accordingly, the actual construction begins after the IOD/ CC is received from the Municipal Corporation for the construction of the building. After the demolition of the old building, the responsibility of providing temporary accommodation to the residents of that building lies with the concerned developer. Accordingly, the concerned developer provides temporary accommodation to the tenant/ resident or pays monthly rent to them for temporary accommodation. Construction is generally expected to be completed in two to three years. However, due to various reasons, the construction gets delayed or some developers do not build the rest of the construction by doing the partial construction or they do not get the hang of it. In such a situation, it has the most adverse effect on the tenants/ residents of the old building. Therefore, the tenants/ residents of such projects do not get rent and in some cases, the tenants/ residents do not get rent for about 3 to 5 years. In many cases, the construction of a new building is completed a few years after the rent has been paid, at which time the tenant/ resident has to take possession of the landfill in the new building without compromising their outstanding rent or taking the outstanding rent. This is how the tenants/ residents are financially squeezed.
Whenever a no-objection certificate is issued by the Mumbai Building Repair and Reconstruction Board to a developer for the redevelopment of an old cessed building, it is being made mandatory to open an Escrow Account with the concerned developer and the planned cooperative housing society. In this account, the concerned developer will be required to deposit the amount for the next 3 years against the rent payable to the tenant/ occupants of the building. Out of this amount, it will be mandatory to deposit the first 2 years' rent amount in the account within 1 month after receiving the no-objection certificate from the concerned developer and the Municipal Corporation should not issue a Commencement Certificate without submitting written proof of depositing this amount in the account. Also, the remaining rent amount for the third year will be required to be deposited by the concerned developer in the account at the beginning of the third year after the expiry of 2 years. The developer deposits the amount in this account on time

Government Resolution No: VIMANKA-2016/ PR No. 142 (Part-1)/ DUPU-1
The responsibility of checking whether it is done or not will be on the concerned Executive Engineer, Mumbai Building Repair and Reconstruction Board.
Establishment of a vigilance committee to monitor the construction of the redevelopment- The quality of construction of the new building after the redevelopment of the old building must be good. If the construction of buildings, especially those being constructed by the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Corporation, is of excellent quality, then the result of MHADA in the general public will create a good image of the government and increase the credibility of the government. Accordingly, the Chief Officer of the officers of the Mumbai Building Repair and Reconstruction Board, Mumbai Building Repair and Reconstruction Board should form a vigilance committee for each project as follows:
(a) Executive Engineer of the concerned department
(b) Deputy Engineer in the concerned department.
At least 3 representatives of the tenants/ residents of the building concerned.
Duties of the Committee:
The committee shall conduct physical inspection of the construction site of the concerned building every 3 months. Accordingly, a progress report should be prepared. Accordingly, the report should be submitted to the Vice-Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Corporation, through the Chief Officer, Mumbai Building Repair and Reconstruction Board within the next 15 days from the date of the groundbreaking.
The Chief Officer, Mumbai Building Repair and Reconstruction Board should conduct a meeting with the Executive Engineer of the concerned department every 3 months to review all the projects for which No-Objection Certificate has been issued. As per this review, the factual information of each project should be submitted to the government through QPR (Quarterly Progress Report) project-wise Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Maharashtra Housing Area Development Authority.
Guidelines for promoting redevelopment of land acquired under Section 103B of MHAD Act, 1976.
If the tenant/ occupant of the building in which the cess is being levied requests to acquire the building in which he is residing and transfer the property to the designated Co-operative Housing Society for repair/ reconstruction, such property is acquired under Section 103B of Section 8A of the MHAD Act, 1976. However, the Property Owners Association has opposed the move. The SLP has been filed in the Supreme Court and the petition is pending before a 9-judge bench. In this case, relating to the property acquired by the Supreme Court

Government Resolution No: VIMANKA-2016/ PR No. 142 (Part-1)/ DUPU-1
Restrictions have been imposed on the transfer to the society and the said SLP is still pending.
Therefore, since such properties cannot be transferred to the concerned planned cooperative housing society, such buildings cannot be reconstructed/ redeveloped. Therefore, the following steps should be taken for the speedy redevelopment of such properties:
1) The owner of the concerned building and the tenant/ occupants of the building shall jointly prepare a consent term and send it to the MHADA/ Government. In the Supreme Court.
The court should allow it. In order to ensure that no one is harassed while taking consent of the owner and the tenant/ resident of the concerned building, the consent should be videographed under the supervision of the Executive Engineer of the Mumbai Building Repair and Reconstruction Board of the concerned department. The video was taken by the Chief Officer of Photography, Mumbai Building Repair and Reconstruction Board.
Consent term should be filed in Supreme Court together.
(2) In the case of a property whose land has been acquired by the Government under section 103B during the intervening period and the land acquisition proceedings have been carried out up to section 93 (5), if a proposal to cancel the land acquisition is submitted to the Government through MHADA with the consent of 70% of all the owners and all the tenants/ residents of the concerned building, action will be taken by the Government as per the rules. For this also, while taking consent of the concerned tenant/ resident, the video should be photographed under the supervision of the Executive Engineer of the Mumbai Building Repair and Reconstruction Board of the concerned department and the Chief Officer of the video photography, Mumbai Building Repair and Reconstruction Board should strictly inspect and certify that there is no irregularity in this and submit the proposal to the government for approval.
