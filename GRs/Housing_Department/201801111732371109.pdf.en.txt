Accordingly, there are 6 models for projects to be implemented on public lands and 2 models to be implemented on private lands. In order to speed up the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, the government was considering implementing a public-private policy (PPP) in the state.
Government's decision
In order to speed up the construction of houses under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana and to meet the targets set, the Central Government has issued 08 Models for Public-Private Partnership (PPP) projects. Out of these, 06 are for projects on public land and 02 are on private land.
Under the PPP model, affordable housing is to be built on public land by involving private developers on land owned by the state government, local bodies, semi-government agencies, etc. Affordable housing should be built on private land with the participation of private developers. Brief details of these models are as under: 6 Models to be implemented on public land
(a) Replica No. 1) Housing on government land:
In this, selected private developers will be provided plots by the public authority on long-term lease at nominal rates. The private developer will be responsible for the design, construction and financing of affordable housing. Also, the private developer will be responsible for the construction and transfer of the houses within the predetermined standards, predetermined rates and time frame.
(b) Replica No. 2- Mixed developed cross-subsidized housing:
In this, no payment will be made by the public authority for the construction of affordable housing for private developers. Instead, private developers will be allowed to sell the distributed land by maximizing its use for construction.
Further, the developer will have the option to exchange the private developer's plot with the government plot which is similar to the plot provided by the government. In this, the private developer will build affordable houses on private land and will use the government land for maximum construction.
(a) Replica No. 3- Subsidized housing on an annual basis:
As in model 1, the government will provide plots under this model. However, this will provide the private developer with revenue per annum for a period of 15 to 20 years instead of the lump sum revenue at the time of transfer of houses. Thus the developer will manage the project and after the said period the developer will hand over the said house to the public authority.

Government Resolution No: PRIO/ 2017/ No.12/ GRANIDHO-2/ SIKHANA D) Replica No. 4- Annuity and capital subsidy for housing:
This model is equivalent to model 3. However, the private developers will be paid 40 to 50% of the project cost while the construction is going on. The remaining amount will be paid to the private developer in equal installments every year for the next 10 years on successful completion of the project.
(a) Replica No. 5- Housing on the basis of direct ownership:
This is the model No. is equal to 1. However, there will be a direct financial link between the private developer and the beneficiary. The government will provide land and subsidy for the purpose. The cost of the house will be paid directly by the beneficiary to the developer.
(a) Replica No. 6- Housing on direct rent basis:
This is the model No. is equal to 5. However, the ownership of the house will remain with the private developer. So the beneficiary will pay the regular house rent to the developer. In this way, the private developer will recover the cost of the house directly from the beneficiaries. Besides, the private developers will maintain such houses for a predetermined period.
Models to be implemented on private land- 1. Model A: Housing through Credit Linked Interest Subsidy (CLSS): In this, the private developer will provide the plot. The private developer will be responsible for the design, construction and financing of the project, as well as for the predetermined standards, predetermined rates, and prescribed timelines and associated services. Under this model, the responsibility of completing the construction work as per the prescribed standards, transferring the houses to the beneficiaries and recovering the cost of the houses from the concerned beneficiaries, etc. will be of the concerned developer. At the time of taking possession of the house, the beneficiary will be responsible for paying the predetermined price of the house to the developer in lump sum or equal monthly installments. It will be the responsibility of the lending bank to determine the eligibility and selection of beneficiaries.
The public authority will do the necessary coordination between the beneficiaries, banks and developers.
Model-B: Housing through Affordable Housing (AHP): This model is similar to Model-A. However, the price of the house will be decided by the public authority. Also, the eligibility of the beneficiaries will be determined by the public authority and the list of beneficiaries will be announced before the project starts. The process will be carried out in a transparent manner by the eligible beneficiaries. In this, the public authority can take the help of various civic agencies and non-governmental organizations. Further, after completion of construction works to the satisfaction of the beneficiaries as per the prescribed standards, the cost of the houses will be recovered by the private developer from the beneficiaries. Priority will be given to the use of the latest technology.
