Measures for effective implementation of Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban).
The Government of Maharashtra
the Department of Housing
GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: PRIO-2023/ PR No.18-PART 8/ Ministry of Home Affairs-2, Mumbai-400 032
Date: July 17, 2023
The Proposal:
Based on the concept of Housing for All, Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana is being implemented in the State since December, 2015. Under this scheme, there are 6,35,041 subsidized sanctioned houses for the economically weaker sections and the scheme is implemented in 3 components- AHP/ BLC/ ISSR.
However, the progress of the scheme under all these three components has been less than expected resulting in delay in providing houses to the persons belonging to economically weaker sections of the state. Review meetings have been held from time to time at the level of Hon'ble Chief Minister and Hon'ble Deputy Chief Minister, Chief Secretary and Additional Chief Secretary, Housing, regarding the progress of this scheme and it has come to the notice of the Government that the directions given in the said meetings are not being effectively implemented by the steering and implementing agencies. It has also come to the notice of the Government that the Steering Agencies have not been able to devote the required time for implementation of the scheme through their regular activities. Hence, the government should take steps to implement the scheme. Therefore, under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban), the following sub-schemes were under the consideration of the Government.
Government Decisions: As a steering agency for effective implementation of Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban), the following decisions are being taken by MHADA Authority.
Establishment of Project Monitoring Unit (PMU) at the State level.
A State Level Project Management Unit (PMU) is being created under the Housing Department to regularly review the progress of Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban), coordinate with the implementing agencies, take action on the problems faced in the disbursement of funds under the scheme, take all actions related to TPQMA and Social Audit, give wide publicity and dissemination to the scheme, visit the ongoing projects in different cities under the scheme, understand the problems and find solutions to the problems, supervise the functioning of the steering agencies of the scheme, etc.

Government Resolution No: PRO-2023/ PRO-18-PART 8/ House Funds-2
The State Level Project Management Unit (PMU) will be located at Mahahausing, 3rd Floor, Sugar Bhawan, Nariman Point, Mumbai. The MHADA authority should transfer the administrative funds received under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) to Mahahausing for the expenses required for setting up the PMU and the necessary machinery for it.
The PMU will have complete control over the SLTCs and CLTCs functioning in all the implementing agencies. Orders for establishment and functioning of PMU etc. will be issued separately as per requirement in this regard.
To take stock of the progress of projects sanctioned by SLTCs:
Regular review of sanctioned projects under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana is essential for effective implementation. Accordingly, the designated SLTCs should take regular progress reports of all the sanctioned projects. All authorities and all enforcement agencies should cooperate with SLTCs in this regard.
Appointment of Third Party Quality Monitoring Mechanism (TPQMA) and Social Audit Mechanism.
As it is not possible to work with a single third party quality monitoring system (TPQMA) and social audit system in the entire state for quality check and social audit under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) and there are many shortcomings in it, at least 3 TPQMA and 3 Social Audit System should be appointed for each revenue department through PMU.
4. Compiling detailed information on funds disbursed under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana:
MHADA has been informed from time to time to submit the detailed details of the reconciliation of the central and state government subsidy amounts disbursed to the implementing agencies as well as the developers under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana from the inception of the scheme till March 31, 2023. The details should be submitted to the Government by 31st July, 2023. Further, bi-weekly details of the amount of subsidy disbursed by the Central and State Governments should be submitted to the Government. The designated PMU should be given access to view& report download of the nodal bank's portal for monitoring of the funds disbursed as well as access to the State Scheme Manager at the government level.

In case of non-disbursement of funds to the beneficiaries through the implementation mechanism:
If the funds received by the implementing agencies after requisitioning the funds are not spent within 15 days, the funds should be disbursed to other implementing agencies as per their demand. Also, the responsibility should be fixed on the concerned officials if the funds are not utilized despite asking for them.
Since a committee has been constituted under the chairmanship of the Collector for the implementation of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana Housing for All 2022 at the district level through a Government Resolution dated 03.04.2017 of the Housing Department, the responsibility should be fixed on the District Collector for the implementation of Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban). Also, the District Collector should issue show cause notices to the concerned Principal/ CEO/ other officials and fix responsibility on them for the inefficiency of the principals in disbursement of funds at the level of Municipalities/ Municipal Councils. All the principals should be reviewed every 15 days with the reasons for not spending the funds distributed under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana within the stipulated time.
6. Recovery of funds with interest disbursed for projects not actually executed.
The funds released to AHP/ PPP/ JV projects, where funds have been released by the Central and State Governments and the projects have not been implemented, shall be recovered along with interest. Also, all concessions given under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) to the said projects should be withdrawn.
7) Increase in the price of flats without prior approval
Prior approval of SLSMC/ CSMC is required for enhancement of cost of flats of sanctioned projects as per provisions/ guidelines laid down under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban). However, it has been observed that under some projects, the sale of flats has been done by increasing the prices of flats at their own level without obtaining such approval. Action should be taken against those responsible for such incidents.
Geo-tagging and physical verification for disbursement of funds:
Geo-tagging of these projects is mandatory while disbursing funds under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. At the same time, the municipal administration

The Directorate and MHADA authorities should distribute funds only after physical verification of the projects and keeping in mind their physical progress.
Weekly review of the scheme by the Steering Agency:
The State Level Project Management Committee (PMU) shall review the progress of Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) on a weekly basis and submit a bi-weekly report to the Government.
10. Determination of time period for obtaining construction permit:
The duration of Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) is up to December 2024.
Therefore, considering the duration of the scheme, all planning authorities should ensure that the period for obtaining construction permission for projects sanctioned under the scheme does not exceed a maximum of 15 days.
Administrative action to be taken against officers of Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) if their performance is dismal:
Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme for providing pucca houses to EWS (Economically Weaker Sections).
Accordingly, the (urban) action taken on the implementation of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) should be recorded in the confidential report of the concerned officers) CR equipment is very necessary (delay/ negligence in the implementation of the scheme, and if it is found, a departmental inquiry should be proposed against the concerned officers.
12.Allotment of available flats and eligible beneficiaries:
It has been observed that eligible beneficiaries are not available for the flats to be constructed under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. There are many non-governmental organizations (NGOs) working in the state who have a list of such economically weak beneficiaries. Therefore, the implementation agencies which do not have eligible beneficiaries for their projects can provide a list of economically weaker beneficiaries from the non-governmental organizations, through which the PMU should take action to provide the beneficiaries to the implementing agencies by appointing non-governmental organizations. Apartments will be made available to economically weaker sections.

13.B Loans from Banks:
A meeting was held with the Bank of Maharashtra, the lead bank of the state, and all the implementing agencies need to take measures with a view to providing loans to the beneficiaries whose income is as mentioned in the Guidelines (Urban) of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana.
Since the MHADA authority has large deposits in private banks such as ICICI Bank and IndusInd Bank, these private banks should be informed through MHADA about providing loans to the beneficiaries belonging to the economically weaker sections.
Special drive for allotment of pattas:
Persons who are eligible for benefits under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana but do not own land or are encroachers on land owned by local bodies will not be able to avail the benefits of Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban). As a result, a large number of beneficiaries under the BLC component under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, who do not have a place in their name, are being deprived of the scheme. The Municipal Corporation should take necessary action in this regard.
