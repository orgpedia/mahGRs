Government Resolution No: PRO-2020/ PRO 120/ GRIHANIDO-2
Mantralaya, Mumbai- 400 032
Date: 3rd of March, 2023
Read: Minutes of the 50th Meeting of the Central Sanctioning and Controlling Committee held on 22.1.2020
Preamble: The Central Government has issued guidelines regarding Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban).
The definition of family has also been mentioned as family is a component of this scheme. Component No. Under Section 4, subsidy is provided to the beneficiaries belonging to economically weaker sections for construction of houses on their own land. This has been amended by the Central Government on 05.01.2019, as per which a person earning knowledge from an eligible family under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) has been made eligible for a house under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana.
In such a situation, due to the joint family system, since the entire space is in the name of the head of the family, other eligible beneficiaries of the family are not able to take advantage of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) due to lack of space in the name. The government was considering allowing beneficiaries belonging to the same family but having common space to construct multi-storeyed buildings under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) as per the policy of the central government.
GOVERNMENT DECISION: As per the decision taken in the 50th meeting of the Central Sanctioning and Monitoring Committee (CSMC) of the Central Government, the Component No. 4 (BLC) where there is more than one beneficiary of Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) in the same family and they have common space, to enable such eligible beneficiaries to avail the benefit of Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban), they are being allowed to construct multi-storeyed building under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) on common space.
