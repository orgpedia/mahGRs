The proposal-
In order to ensure that every citizen of the country has a house by 2022, the Union Government has launched the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana- Housing for All on 25th June, 2015.
The scheme is being implemented in the State from 9/12/2015. The State has set a target of constructing 19.40 lakh houses by 2022 under the scheme. However, due to inadequate and traditional technology and limited skilled manpower and ancillary reasons, it is not feasible to construct such a large number of houses in a stipulated time frame.
Therefore, in order to speed up the projects under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, the government was considering adopting sustainable, sustainable and environment-friendly construction technologies by reducing the use of traditional technologies, faster and with less use of water and building materials.
Government's decision
At present, the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana is being implemented in 382 local bodies of the state, Mumbai/ Pune/ Nashik/ Aurangabad/ Nagpur Metropolitan Regional Development Authorities, CIDCO, NAINA, MSRDC, NITs etc. MHADA has been designated as the Mission Directorate and the nodal agency for the scheme. Separate housing projects of MHADA are also proposed. For all such projects, the following list of 16 technologies recommended by the Building Materials and Technology Council (BMTPC) under the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, Government of India is being approved.

10) Light Gauge Steel Framed Structure (LGSFS),
11) Light Gauge Steel Framed Structure with Infill Concrete Panels (LGSFS-ICP),
D) Steel Structural Systems
12) Factory made Fast Track Building System,
13) Speed Floor System,

14) Waffle-Crete Building System,
15) Precast Large Concrete Panel System,
16) Industrialized 3-S System using RCC precast with or without Shear walls, columns, Beams, Cellular Light weight Concrete Slabs / Semi-Precast Solid Slab.
The local/ geographical conditions of all the places where the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana is being implemented are different. The Central Public Works Department, Government of India has notified the rates of 3 construction technologies out of the above 16 types of construction technologies, namely Monolithic Concrete Construction, Expanded Polystyrene Core Panel System& Light Luggage Steel Frame System. Therefore, a limited e-tendering process should be implemented for these 3 technical orders and construction orders should be issued to the eligible bidders concerned by fixing the rates through this tender. So
The remaining 13 types of technologies will be priced by the Central Public Works Department, Government of India.
After being determined and published, those rates should be taken into account. Currently, there are 13
Construction orders should be awarded by fixing the rates through an open e-tendering process based on specific parameters for construction using technology.
PM Modi will visit 382 local bodies, Mumbai/ Pune/ Nashik/ Aurangabad/ Nagpur Metropolitan Regional Development Authorities, CIDCO, NAINA, MSRDC, NITs, etc.
