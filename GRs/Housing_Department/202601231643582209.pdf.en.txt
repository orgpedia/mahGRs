3. History of the meeting of the State Level Appraisal Committee (SLAC) (4th meeting) held on 01.10.2025.
Preamble: - The scrutiny of Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) received under AHP and AHP-PPP components under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) 2.0 shows a mismatch between the rates of flats in economically weaker sections, the built-up area of flats and the no-objection certificates obtained in terms of construction. To that end, the government was considering issuing guidelines for AHP and AHP-PPP components under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) 2.0.
As per the directions of the State Level Appraisal Committee (SLAC) meeting, when the proposals received under the Government Circular Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) 2.0 were placed before the State Level Appraisal Committee (SLAC), the following guidelines are being issued for AHP and AHP-PP units as there is no uniformity between the rates of flats in economically weaker sections under the AHP and Public-Private Partnership (AHP-PPP) component, construction of flats AA (built-up area) and no-objection certificates obtained in terms of construction: - 1) At least 25 Beneficiary Attachment shall be mandatory for all AHP projects under AHP component if the sale price of flats in economically weaker sections (EWS) exceeds the current Annual Rate (ASR) by 20% before starting actual construction.

If the sale price of EWS flats under the AHP-PPP component is more than 20 per cent of the current Annual Rate of Sale (ASR), then all such AHP-PPP projects will be required to register at least 25 per cent of the beneficiaries under the scheme before the grant of enhanced FSi sanctioned under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana or other benefits of Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) 2.0. The proposal needs to be re-submitted to the state-level Project Management Unit (PMU) after the beneficiary's registration before availing the benefits of Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) 2.0.
In case of EWS flats in AHP and AHP-PPP projects under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) 2.0, the built-up area of the flat should not exceed 1. 4 times the carpet area of the flat. Therefore, in Annexure 4B, 57, 50, while specifying the construction area or deducting the sale price of flats, care should be taken that the construction IA (built-up area) of the flats does not exceed 1. 4 times the carpet area of the flats.
While submitting proposals under AHP and AHP-PPP components under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) 2.0, most of the implementing agencies have stated that various no-objection certificates have not been submitted or are being submitted. However, henceforth, the following valid No Objection Certificates (NOCs) should be submitted along with the proposal while submitting the proposal under the AHP and AHP-PPP components.
