2) Government Decision, Housing Department, No. 2019/ No. 10/ Duwpu-1, Dy. 13.09.2019.
Introduction: The redevelopment of old and dilapidated buildings in the state is carried out by a developer appointed by the concerned cooperative housing society as per the procedure prevailing under the provisions of the Development Control Rules permissible by the concerned planning authority/ municipal corporation/ local body. In such cases, the benefits accruing from the project accrue to the developer. In this redevelopment process, the project is implemented at the developer's discretion. Therefore, since the participation of the stakeholders in the project is minimal, they face various difficulties if the project is stuck in an incomplete state. If the members of the concerned cooperative housing societies come together and do self-redevelopment after considering all these aspects carefully, the concerned cooperative society will remain in control of the redevelopment project and all the benefits received from the project redevelopment will be received by the members of the cooperative society.
