Read Government Resolution No: PRO 2017/ No.12/ Grameenidho-2/ Shikhana, Dy. 11.01.2017.
The government has issued a circular regarding the implementation of the model issued by the central government for public-private partnership (PPP) projects under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana in the state. The Government decision has been issued on 11.1.2018. For the effective implementation of the policy in the state, the government decided to conduct a tender process, select private developers, select lands and issue detailed Request for Proposal (RFP) in respect of relevant matters. Accordingly, the process of selecting suitable land and developers by accepting bids under the Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) policy should be uniform across the state, and the government was considering issuing a general instruction to ensure that there is streamlining and uniformity in the process.
In the background of the above, the circular is being issued along with the Request for Proposal and Guidelines. As per the policy, the process of conducting the tender process, selection of private developers, selection of land and related matters will be done by the concerned agencies at the next level.
