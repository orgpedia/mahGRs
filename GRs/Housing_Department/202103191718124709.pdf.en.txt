Government Circular: Various redevelopment proposals are approved at the level of Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority. There is no information in this regard on the government side.
If there are irregularities in some proposals, complaints come to the government. But the government has no information about this and no information can be given at the government level in such cases and complaints cannot be resolved. Therefore, in order to have coherence and uniformity in the work of MHADA and the government, the important matters that MHADA has at present need to be done with the approval of the government.
The MHADA authority issues the grant letters for the redevelopment of the cessed/ MHADA owned buildings in Mumbai city and suburbs under Development Control Rules 33 (5), 33 (6), 33 (7) and 33 (9) of DCPR-2034. At the same time, the Regional Board under the MHADA Authority also issues letters of credit for the redevelopment of buildings owned by MHADA. Such letters have often been found to be against the government's stated policy. As a result, the image of the government in the public mind is tarnished and in such cases, many times the star questions/ attention-grabbing suggestions/ various legislative weapons are used to malign the image of the government. MPs raise questions in Parliament. Since the government is answerable to the legislature, it becomes difficult for the government to answer the legislature in such a wrong case.
Accordingly, in accordance with the powers conferred on the Government under the provisions of Section 164 (1) of the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Act, 1976, the following directions/ instructions are being issued:
