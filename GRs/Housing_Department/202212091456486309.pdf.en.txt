READ: Housing Department's Government Resolution No. 2021/ No. 135/ Zopsu-1, D. 25.05.2022
Preamble: It has been decided to take measures such as implementing the Abhaya scheme to complete the stalled slum rehabilitation scheme and appointing a new developer to complete the slum rehabilitation scheme by implementing the tender process in the stalled schemes.
Accordingly, the financial institutions (RBI, SEBI, NHB approved) who have provided funds for the implementation of the scheme are to be registered as co-developers in the Letter of Intent. However, some organizations have expressed their inability to work as joint developers in the plans. Instead, they have been requested to register themselves as Lenders in the records and allow them to appoint a competent agency for the actual implementation of the scheme. Read the above here. The matter of partial modification of the Government decision dated 25.05.2022 was under consideration of the Government.
Government's statement: Read here. In the Government Order dated 25.05.2022, under the heading Implementation of Amnesty Scheme, in paragraph No. 2," The financial institutions (RBI, SEBI, NHB approved) who have provided funds for the implementation of the scheme will be recorded as co-developers in the Letter of Intent" instead of" The financial institutions (RBI, SEBI, NHB approved) who have provided funds for the implementation of the scheme will be recorded as co-developers/ lenders in the Letter of Intent." Also, the scheme will be approved for implementation by the competent authority appointed/ authorised by them.
