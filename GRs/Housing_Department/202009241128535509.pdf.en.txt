Introduction: The Government is implementing the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme with the noble objective of making a slum-free Mumbai and alternatively a slum-free Maharashtra. Initially, due to demonetisation and the recent global pandemic like Corona, the financial condition of private developers has become fragile. As a result, the private developers are in financial difficulties to implement the slum rehabilitation scheme. Therefore, it is becoming difficult to maintain the expected speed in the implementation of the rehabilitation plan day by day.
As per the existing provisions, it is becoming difficult for the developers to pay almost 25 percent of the overheads at the beginning of the project. Also, it is becoming financially difficult for the developers to implement the scheme effectively after depositing the said amount. Therefore, the matter of giving concession to the developers to pay the overage was under the consideration of the government.
GOVERNMENT DECISION: In view of the above facts, the Government have carefully considered and issued the following guidelines regarding the overcharging and recovery of overcharging by private developers while redeveloping slums on public owned land. It has been decided to prescribe the following stages and rates till 31st March, 2021:
