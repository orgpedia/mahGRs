Introduction Kamathipura area in South Mumbai has a distinct identity and has a history of more than two hundred years. The area got its name Kamathipura from the perseverance of Telugu-speaking labourers who came from Andhra in the 18th century. At present, most of the buildings in Kamathipura area are in a dilapidated condition.
In South Mumbai's Kamathipura area, Gali No. There are about 943 cess buildings in lanes 1 to 15, in which about 8238 tenants/ residents are residing. These buildings are about 100 years old. A total of 349 non-subsidized buildings, 14 religious structures, 02 schools and 04 reserved plots are present in the area. In addition, there are a total of 11 reconstructed buildings built by MHADA. Out of 943 cess buildings in the area, 180 buildings have been demolished till the ground floor as they are dangerous and the tenants/ occupants have been shifted to the transit camp of the Mumbai Building Repair and Reconstruction Board. Out of these, 123 buildings have been declared beyond repair under Section 88 (3) of MHAD Act, 1976. The total area covered by the plots is about 1,11,654 sq.
(27.59 acres). Because the building plots in this area are so small and narrow, they cannot be redeveloped independently. Cluster Redevelopment under Regulation 33 (9) of the Development Control and Promotion Rules, 2034 will ensure integrated development of the entire area and provide safe and secure housing and planned infrastructure facilities to the residents. Therefore, the matter of redevelopment of old and dilapidated cessed and non-cessed buildings and plots in Gali No. 1 to 15 of Kamathipura area was under the consideration of the Government through MHAD under the Development Control and Promotion Rules, 2034, Regulation 33 (9).
