Preamble: In pursuance of the decision taken by the State Cabinet regarding the sale and development of closed/ sick textile mills after the strike of 1982, Regulation 58 (1) (b) has been inserted in the Brihanmumbai Development Control Rules, 1991.
It has also been provided in Regulation 35 of the Brihanmumbai Development Control and Promotion Regulation-2034. As per the said provision, allotment of free space and remaining floor area of 58 closed/ sick textile mills of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is usually 1/3 rd share.
A provision has been made to give 1/3 share to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, MHADA and 1/3 share to the mill owners.
MHADA has collected data of mill workers regarding construction of houses by MHADA on the land of 58 closed/ sick mills in the year 2010, 2011 and 2016.
In the three drives conducted in 2017, about 1,74,000 mill workers/ their heirs have applied for mill workers' houses. Out of these, MHADA has been allotted three plots of 13,453 houses available on the land of the mills taken over by MHADA and four plots have been allotted to MMRDA under the Rental Housing Scheme.
Since the eligibility of the mill workers had not yet been determined and some of the winning mill workers had not yet received possession of the houses, the government was considering the formation of a committee to control these matters.
Government's decision:
To check the eligibility of mill workers, release of flats to eligible mill workers, to control the successful millers in getting possession of houses/ flats in time, the following committees are being constituted:
