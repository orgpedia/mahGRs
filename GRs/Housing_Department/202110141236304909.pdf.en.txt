The Proposal:
Read above. 1 here. Guidelines for determining eligibility of beneficiaries for redevelopment of BDD chawls have been issued vide Government Resolution dated 24.04.2018. The procedure to be followed by the Director, BDD Chali in the case of transfer of inheritance of deceased tenants in the chali has also been prescribed. After the death of the original tenant of the chawl, there is no consensus as to which heirs should be named after their heirs, in such a case, despite conducting hearings with the Director, BDD Chali, the respective heirs do not attend those hearings. Therefore, the process of transfer of gunny bags with such inheritance is pending and therefore, the eligibility of gunny bags holders in BDD Chawls cannot be determined in such cases, said Vice Chairman and CEO, MHADA. 2 here. This has been brought to the notice of the Government vide letter dated 07.09.2021. Hence, the government had issued a notification in this regard.
Government documents:
After the death of the original tenant of the chawl, there was no consensus on the transfer of the gala in the name of his heir after his death, and as the heirs concerned did not provide information about the other heirs, the director, B.D.D. Chali, was given the responsibility of the transfer. 24.04.2018

In cases where the decision to transfer the tenancy cannot be taken even in joint name as per the procedure prescribed in the Government Order, the tenant who is presently residing in the gaol shall be entitled to transfer the tenancy.
Temporary relocation to a transit camp should be done. However, the said Gala should be kept in the name of Director, BDD Chali. The chawls shall be made available and on the basis of the information/ documents, necessary orders for transfer of the chawls to the heirs shall be issued by the Director, BDD Chawls, as per which the possession of the redeveloped chawls in lieu of the original chawls concerned shall be handed over to the respective heirs. The above conditions should be clearly incorporated in the agreement to be made with the concerned gaol holders in such cases regarding the gaol in the transit camp.
While reserving the silt in the name of Chali, the record of the original silt holder/ his heirs in respect of the silt is maintained by the Director, BDD Chali.
Be sure to keep a record. So that after submission of necessary documents by the heirs of the original tenant concerned, there will be no problem in making available the redeveloped tenant to the concerned in lieu of the original tenant.
