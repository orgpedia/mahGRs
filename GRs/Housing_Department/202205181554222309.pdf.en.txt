The main objective of MHADA is to provide affordable shelter facilities to the citizens of low-income, middle-income and high-income groups in the cities of Maharashtra. While providing shelter facilities to the citizens of the state, from the point of view of social responsibility, MHADA is providing hospitals for citizens, hostels for boys and girls, shelter facilities for stray animals and hospitals for pets etc.
MHADA has also decided to take up the construction work. In short, in recent times, MHADA has started taking steps to ensure that the scope of its work is not limited to the welfare of the citizens but is multifaceted in terms of social commitment. In addition, MHADA-owned amenity plots will also be developed through MHADA.
Architects, Structural Engineers, Project Management Consultants are the three components that are important when building housing complexes, redeveloping old colonies, developing amenity plots and executing large urban redevelopment projects through MHAD. There are many important factors like attractiveness, compactness, fire protection, solid waste management, sewerage system, vehicle floor, adequate sunlight, air, energy conservation. Considering all of them together, the importance of all three components/ construction technicians- Architects, Structural Engineers and Project Management Consultants- for construction is unique. Therefore, the government is taking the following decisions in order to prepare the list of all the three construction technicians in the construction sector:
Government Decision: The process of preparing the list of construction technicians such as architects, structural engineers, project management consultants for various construction and redevelopment projects to be implemented by MHADA should be started in the month of February every 2 years. The notification for inviting applications should be issued by MHADA in the last week of February.
