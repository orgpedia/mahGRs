As per the provisions of Section 76 to Section 103 of MHAD Act, 1976, old and dilapidated buildings on the island of Mumbai are repaired and their land is acquired under certain conditions. When old buildings are declared dangerous or beyond repair, the tenants/ residents are shifted to transit camps under the Mumbai Building Repair and Reconstruction Board. Similarly, the Mumbai Building Repair and Reconstruction Board provides temporary transit shelters from time to time to the residents of dangerous, dilapidated buildings as well as beyond repair, collapsed buildings. The distribution is done with the approval of the Joint Chief Officer/ DWP Board. Apart from this, the occupants of these buildings are taken on the master list as they will not be able to be reconstructed in place of the buildings affected due to narrow plots, reservation, provisions in the Development Control Rules, road widening, etc. in Mumbai city.
The Mumbai Building Repair and Reconstruction Board (BMRB) has been receiving houses of various sizes through additional construction area under Regulation 33 (7) of the Development Control Regulations. The distribution of these houses is expected to be done to eligible persons in the larger list. However, it has been observed by the government that the original beneficiaries are still deprived of the benefits. With this, the government is considering to improve the process of allotment of plots through the Mumbai Building Repair and Reconstruction Board as well as the transition camp.
