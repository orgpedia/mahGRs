Government Resolution No: Allotment-2017/ PR No.65/ Grihanibhu (Sikhana),
Madam Cama Marg, Hutatma Rajguru Chowk,
Mantralaya, Mumbai- 400 032
Date: 29th of December 2022
Housing Department, Government Circular No: Allotment-2017/ PR No. 65/ Grihanibhu, dated 30.05.2019.
2) Housing Department, Government Circular No: SRIKH- 2022/ PR No.113/ GRANIBHU, dated 15.09.2022
3) Housing Department, Government Resolution No. 2011/ Q. No. 242/ Rehabilitation-3/ Housing, dated 16.11.2022.
Preamble: The MHADA Authority in its Resolution No. 6260, dated 4.6.2007. As per the said policy, such breakaway plots, neither breakaway nor independently developable plots and recreational grounds were being shared among themselves at MHADA level. Thereafter, under Regulation 16 of the MHADA Act, 1982, the Cabinet Sub-Committee was empowered to allocate the adjacent land parcels if the area of the original plot in MHADA's jurisdiction is more than 4000 sq.m.
Since the original plot area in MHADA's Abhinaya within the limits of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation is not found to be more than 4000 sqm, instead of placing the proposal before the Cabinet Sub-Committee, the original plot area in the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority's Abhinaya has been increased to 4000 sqm. The powers to distribute land parcels beyond 30.05.2019 were conferred on the Government by an order dated 30.05.2019.
In order to decentralize the powers of development works being carried out by the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority, in 13 cases, the powers at the government level were returned to the MHADA authority. Accordingly, vide order dated 15.09.2022, the Government Circular dated 30.05.2019 stands cancelled. As a result, the area of the original plot under the management of Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority was reduced to 4000 sq. The Cabinet Sub-Committee was again empowered to allocate spare plots, if more than I, and a new Cabinet Sub-Committee was constituted vide order dated 16.11.2022 at Wacha. However, the original plot of land in MHADA's jurisdiction within the limits of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is spread over 4000 sq. Since the acting senior to me is very less, the government was considering to approve such a proposal again at the government level instead of the cabinet sub-committee.
