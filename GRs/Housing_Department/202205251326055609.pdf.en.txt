Government Decision No. Parikshit-2021/ P. No. 135/ Jhopsu-1
Madam Cama Marg, Hutatma Rajguru Chowk,
Ministry, Mumbai- 400 032.
Date: 25th of May 2022.
Reference: Chief Executive Officer, Slum Rehabilitation Authority, Mumbai vide letter No. Jhopupra/ Abhi/ 45/99/2021, dated 24.11.2021.
The Proposal:
The Government is implementing the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme with the noble objective of making Mumbai slum-free and Maharashtra slum-free. Initially, due to demonetisation and the subsequent global pandemic like Corona, the economic condition of private developers has weakened. As a result, most of the slum rehabilitation schemes in Mumbai have been put on hold. The developers are not rehabilitating the slum dwellers on time as they are not paying the rent of the eligible slum dwellers and the schemes are getting delayed. This is creating a sense of dissatisfaction among the residents.
The developers of the slum rehabilitation scheme are not paying rent to the eligible slum dwellers of the scheme on time. It has been observed that the slum rehabilitation scheme is not being implemented even after giving concessions in various charges to the developers in respect of such stalled projects. Since the slum rehabilitation authority has not made the necessary progress despite repeated meetings with the developers regarding the outstanding rent of the slum dwellers and the stalled projects, the government was considering to approve the appointment of a new developer through the tender process for such stalled slum rehabilitation schemes and to allow the financial institutions who have invested in such rehabilitation schemes and whose financial institutions are approved by the Reserve Bank of India, SEBI or NHB to complete the stalled schemes.
GOVERNMENT DECISIONS: The Slum Rehabilitation Authority is hereby approved to take the following measures to complete the stalled slum rehabilitation schemes: 1. Appointment of developer through tender process: In the stalled schemes under the Slum Rehabilitation Authority, the Slum Rehabilitation Authority has decided to take the following steps to complete the stalled slum rehabilitation schemes in the Maharashtra Slum Areas (MSZ). N. and P. Section 13 (2) of the Act, 1971 provides for action against the developer. As well as in the plans

Cooperative housing societies have been allowed to appoint new developers. They have been given three months" time. But if for some reason a new developer has not been appointed in such schemes and if the rehabilitation work is stalled due to the rent dues of the slum dwellers in such schemes, then the slum rehabilitation authority should conduct a tender process in such stalled schemes and prepare a list of competent developers to implement the slum rehabilitation scheme and get it approved by the government. A new developer will be appointed for the slum rehabilitation projects that have been left out of this list.
So that such stalled slum rehabilitation schemes can be implemented at a faster pace. The developer who will transfer the maximum floor area of the saleable units available in the scheme to the government in the form of" Affordable Housing for All" will be appointed as the developer for the scheme.
2) The implementation of the Amnesty Scheme:
Investment in slum rehabilitation schemes is made through various financial institutions.
Also the powers to sell the sale component available in the scheme by the developers of slum rehabilitation scheme are given to such financial institution in relation to their investment.
These financial institutions are not on the record of the Slum Rehabilitation Authority.
The developers of the slum rehabilitation scheme are not completing the construction of the rehabilitation component of the scheme due to some reasons. Also, despite the supply of finance, eligible slum dwellers are not rehabilitated in time as they are paying rent and the scheme is deliberately delayed. Financial institutions that have invested in such a rehabilitation scheme suffer financial losses. Since these financial institutions are not on the record of the Slum Rehabilitation Authority, it is not possible for the Slum Rehabilitation Authority to approve them despite having the financial capacity to complete their scheme. Financial institutions approved by Reserve Bank of India, SEBI or NHB will be allowed to complete the stalled projects. The financial institutions (RBI, SEBI, NHB approved) who have provided funds for the implementation of the scheme will be registered as co-developers in the Letter of Intent and such financial institution will be allowed to implement the stalled scheme.
The following terms and conditions apply to both plans:
1) The consent of the hut owners will not be required for the appointment of new developers/ financial institutions.
2) These financial institutions will not be required to pay 5% of the excess amount as per the Slum Rehabilitation Policy.
