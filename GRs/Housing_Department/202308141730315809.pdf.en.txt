The Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) based on the concept of Housing for All is being implemented in the State since December, 2015. Under this scheme, the number of sanctioned houses subsidized for economically weaker sections is currently 6,35,041 and the scheme is implemented in the state by the department in 3 components- AHP/ BLC/ ISSR. However, since the progress of the scheme under all these three components is less than expected, there is a delay in providing houses to the persons belonging to the economically weaker sections of the state. Review meetings have been held at the level of Hon'ble Chief Minister, Hon'ble Deputy Chief Minister, Chief Secretary and Additional Chief Secretary, Housing from time to time regarding the progress of this scheme and it has come to the notice of the Government that the directions given by them in the said meetings are not being effectively implemented by the steering agencies and implementing agencies. It has also come to the notice of the Government that the Steering Agencies have not been able to devote the required time for implementation of the scheme through their regular activities. Hence, the government should take steps to implement the scheme. It has been observed that the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Gramin) being implemented in the state is being implemented effectively. It has also been observed that a project management mechanism has been put in place at the state level for day-to-day management of the scheme, resolution of issues faced in the scheme, disbursement of funds, updating of Management Information System (MIS), etc. Considering all these aspects, the measures to be taken for effective implementation of Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) in the State and to speed up the progress of the scheme and to provide houses to the beneficiaries within the prescribed time frame are mentioned in Reference No. 2 By Government Resolution dated 17th July, 2023
