Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA) to consider proposals for combined redevelopment by incorporating more than one building/ institution/ undertaking without redevelopment of single buildings.
The Government of Maharashtra
the Department of Housing
Government Resolution No: Allotment-2021/ PR No.60/ Grihanibhu
Madam Cama Marg, Hutatma Rajguru Chowk,
3rd Floor, Mantralaya, Mumbai 400 032
Date: 28th of April, 2022.
The Proposal:
While the matter of collective redevelopment is under the consideration of the government, proposals for the redevelopment of single buildings in some places are being received by MHADA. However, the redevelopment of such stand-alone buildings does not make it possible to build the necessary infrastructure in the area and plan accordingly. Alternatively, if the redevelopment of single buildings is approved, the proper development of the entire area cannot be done in a planned manner. Accordingly, the following decisions are being taken: Government Decision: Under the MHADA Sub-Division of Mumbai, Konkan, Nashik and Pune, the redevelopment proposal of single buildings should not be approved under any circumstances to enable the development of planned infrastructure and proper planning of the area in the areas where redevelopment has not yet been permitted.
Approval/ No Objection Certificate should be granted only to proposals for integrated redevelopment covering maximum number of buildings/ institutions/ establishments in the area to be redeveloped.
In exceptional circumstances, if a single building is required to be redeveloped, a self-explanatory proposal should be submitted for prior approval of the Government and only after receiving Government approval, approval/ no-objection certificate should be given to the redevelopment proposal of such single buildings.
Strict action will be taken against those found violating the order, the officials said.
