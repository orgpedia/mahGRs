Preamble: In pursuance of the Government Resolution, dated 28.3.2018, a one-man committee under the Chairmanship of Mr. Johny Joseph, Retired Chief Secretary, was appointed to conduct an in-depth inquiry and submit a report to the Government regarding the redevelopment of Siddhartha Nagar Cooperative Housing Society (Patrachal) in Goregaon (West), Mumbai under the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA).
The committee sent its report to the government.
Similarly, MHADA has been directed to take over the project as the concerned developer has violated the directives and timelines of the government as well as MHADA. The notice of termination was issued on 12.1.2018. Against this notice of termination. A writ petition has been filed in the High Court. The petition is still pending.
To the Chief Minister. The matter was discussed in the review meeting held on 13.1.2020. The project is in the process of being redeveloped since 2007 and around 672 original residents of these chawls are still waiting for resettlement flats. Similarly, there are complaints that the residents have not been paid rent for several months by the concerned developers. Now the case. The process of redevelopment has been delayed as the High Court has jurisdiction.
Similarly, MHADA has released 306 flats constructed on the basis of the receipt from MHADA two years ago. However, the houses have not been handed over yet.
The government should take immediate steps in this regard.
Government Decision: In the matter of payment of outstanding rent to the original residents of the redevelopment project of Siddhartha Nagar Cooperative Housing Society in Patrachar Colony, Goregaon, Mumbai, completing the process of their rehabilitation, distribution of flats to the 306 winners of the said MHADA draw, and other related issues, the judicial entry in the matter was/ is pending.
