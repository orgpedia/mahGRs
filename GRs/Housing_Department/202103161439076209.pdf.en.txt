Government Circular, No. Allotment-2021/ PR No. 54/ Grihanibhu,
Madam Cama Marg, Hutatma Rajguru Chowk,
Mantralaya, Mumbai- 400 032
Date: 16th of March 2021
Government Circular: Various redevelopment proposals are approved at the level of Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority. There is no information in this regard on the government side.
If there are irregularities in some proposals, complaints come to the government. But the government has no information about this and no information can be given at the government level in such cases and complaints cannot be resolved. Therefore, in order to have coherence and uniformity in the work of MHADA and the government, the important matters that MHADA has at present need to be done with the approval of the government.
There are 56 MHADA colonies in Mumbai. Similarly, MHADA owns buildings elsewhere in the state. The redevelopment of buildings in these colonies is done by the respective cooperative housing societies by appointing a developer at their level. This land is owned by the government. However, MHADA takes action on grant of No Objection Certificate only after the proposals for redevelopment of such plots are received from the Co-operative Housing Society/ concerned developer. MHADA has no control over this redevelopment process. Since there is only a bilateral agreement between the concerned housing society and the developer, MHADA cannot interfere if the terms and conditions are violated. The redevelopment projects of many housing societies in MHADA have been stalled for years. Similarly, the rent and other grievances of the concerned residents are also not being resolved properly.
Accordingly, in accordance with the powers conferred on the Government under the provisions of Section 164 (1) of the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Act, 1976, the following directions/ instructions are being issued:
