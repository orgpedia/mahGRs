Since the tenderer has given a bank guarantee to the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation for 728 flats in Padegaon G. Aurangabad, the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation should take an appropriate decision in accordance with the tenderer's work order at the rate decided by the committee for the said plot.
The committee should recommend steps to be taken to complete the remaining flats, except the 7,000 flats in the first phase, on time.
The Committee will submit its report on the above issues before 20th December, 2022.
