In case the scheme is not viable even after allowing the above discount, the concerned developer may request for an incentive price not exceeding 20% of the Market Value Rate (ASR) price along with a detailed reason for the non-viability of the scheme, taking into consideration the recommendations of MHADA and State Level Appraisal Committee (SLAC). The State Level Sanctioning and Monitoring Committee (SLSMC), headed by the Chief Secretary, will take an appropriate decision on giving an incentive price above 20%.
This provision is retroactive. This will be effective from 11.06.2018.
