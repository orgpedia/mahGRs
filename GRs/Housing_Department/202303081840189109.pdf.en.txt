Preamble: In the review meeting of Konkan Housing and Area Development Board dated 15.11.2022, it was brought to the notice of the Government that the State Level Appraisal Committee (SLAC) headed by the Additional Chief Secretary (Housing) and the State Level Sanctioning and Controlling Committee (SLSMC) headed by the Chief Secretary have approved the increase in house prices in some projects under Konkan Housing Board and the proposal has been submitted to the approval of the Central Sanctioning and Controlling Committee (CSMC).
However, since no issue regarding tariff hike was discussed in the meeting of SLAC and SLSMC, it was not appropriate to submit the proposal of tariff hike of the projects to CSMC without bringing any issue regarding tariff hike to the notice of SLAC and SLSMC. It was also decided to constitute a committee to formulate criteria for proposals for revision of cost of flats in projects sanctioned under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) as it is not possible to increase the cost of flats by 80-90 per cent when the projects under Konkan Housing Board have got government land free of cost under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana.
The State Level Appraisal Committee (SLAC) dated 22.02.2023. Accordingly, the Government was contemplating to constitute a Committee to formulate the criteria for revision of rates of flats in the approved projects in AHP/ AHP-PPP/ AHP-JV under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban).

4. While determining the criteria for revision of rates of flats in the projects approved by the above Committee, the Committee should consider the following:- The facilities provided to the developers under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana should be taken into consideration. This will ensure that the approved rates are lower than the market rates and the beneficiaries belonging to the lowest income group will get houses at affordable rates.
â€¢ If the land in the project received for the improvement of the rates of the flats belongs to the government, then it will be joint to increase the rates for such projects as the land is received free of cost or how,
Whether it would be appropriate to revise the rates of the flats of the projects which have been approved about a year ago?
What will be the fixed targets and formula for revision of rates of flats in the projects which have been sanctioned before March, 2020?
How or why should a project consider price increase in order to be at least incremental?
