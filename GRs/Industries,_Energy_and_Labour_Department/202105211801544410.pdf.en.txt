Mantralaya, Mumbai- 400 032
Date is May 21, 2021
Introduction: India, including Maharashtra, has been facing the Corona epidemic since March 2020.
Since March 2021, the second wave of Corona has spread all over the country, and Maharashtra has been hit hard. The state government is making all efforts to strengthen the health system as the number of corona patients is increasing rapidly. Due to the situation arising out of the Covid-19 pandemic in the state, the need and urgency for medical oxygen has arisen in the state. At present, the total number of cases in the state is 1,300. Tonnes of oxygen per day (LMO) is being produced and the demand is 1800 m.p.m. It's a ton. The production is being done by 32 industrial units in the state and at present, the oxygen supply is being supplied to the state by requisitioning oxygen from other states as the production of oxygen (LMO) in the state is insufficient. Experts have said that the third wave of Covid-19 is also likely to come in 4-5 months and its intensity will be even higher. Therefore, the demand for oxygen supply in the future will be 500 more. With the possibility of increasing the tonnage per day, the total for the state in the future will be 2300 m. Daily oxygen supply will be required.
In view of the current situation in the country, every state needs oxygen (LMO) and Maharashtra has considered various options to meet its own oxygen (LMO) requirement. 500 per day at least to enable the State to generate LMO and to ensure that there is no shortage of oxygen in the State. New oxygen generation plants need to be set up. At present, major projects are operational in industrially developed Pune, Raigad, etc. However, due to many difficulties in transporting oxygen to other parts of the state, oxygen supply could not be delivered on time. Therefore, there is an urgent need to set up LMO plants in other parts of the state such as Vidarbha, Marathwada, Dhule, Nandurbar, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg districts.

Meanwhile, the state government is making efforts to increase the production of oxygen (LMO) in other parts of the state as well. This will help the state government to become self-reliant in oxygen production.
The current oxygen generation capacity of the state is 800-1000 MT in the next one year. While proposing an attractive strategy to achieve the target of increasing tonnage per day, the focus is on the following:
Promotion of new and big projects:- Financial support and incentives for large and mid-sized enterprises to make their projects financially viable to urgently increase oxygen production in the state where there is a greater need.
Incentives to established industries:- Financial assistance and incentives to existing industries which produce oxygen as they will be able to expand their production capacity quickly.
Driving the Small and Micro Enterprises:- Considering the geographical and industrial situation of Maharashtra and keeping in mind that large projects will not go to remote areas, special incentives will be given to those industries who will set up oxygen production plants with less capacity, who are in this business as refillers and will supply to the local area.
Ease of Doing Business Policy (EoDB):- A committee will be set up to expedite all the processes in this regard, as well as to provide various permissions to the industry units immediately and for further control. The committee will meet from time to time and apprise the government of the progress made in this regard by taking appropriate action.
In view of the urgency to produce as much oxygen as possible in the state to meet the state's medical oxygen needs in the backdrop of COVID-19, under the" Mission Oxygen Swavalamban," the government was considering to allow special incentives for setting up new (new as well as expansion)" Oxygen Manufacturing along with Storage and Cylinder Filling Facility (LMO)" plants in the state to meet the COVID-19 crisis and to empower the health system and make the state self-reliant in oxygen production.
Government's decision:
In view of the above situation, to meet the state's requirement of medical oxygen in the backdrop of COVID-19, under" Mission Oxygen Swavalamban," the state government has taken several steps to deal with the COVID-19 crisis and to strengthen the health system.
New (new as well as expansion) Oxygen in the state to make the state self-reliant in production"
