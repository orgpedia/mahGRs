The Common Application Form (CAF) in the Online Building Plan Sanction (OBPS) computer system developed for the jurisdiction of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) will show the approximate date of commencement of construction of any building or other construction. So, the notice to start any building or other construction is a part of the Common Application Form (CAF). Henceforth it is not necessary to send or arrange for sending a written notice to every employer under sample 4 of rule 52 to the inspector in authority.
Therefore, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) should provide information from time to time about the commencement of construction and completion of construction through the online computer system of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation to all the concerned Regional Government Labour Officers and Inspectors of the Labour Department. So that the concerned employer does not have to make a separate demand.
