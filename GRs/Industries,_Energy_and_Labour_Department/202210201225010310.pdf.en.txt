Reference:- Election Commission of India No.78/ EPS/ 2022/22163, D. The letter is dated October 10, 2022.
Our country has adopted a democratic system and all registered citizens above the age of 18 are expected to cast 100 per cent votes in every election. In view of this, Rule 135 (b) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 (Part-II) provides that on the day of poll, the electors are generally given a paid holiday or, in some cases, a reasonable relaxation in working hours to enable them to exercise their franchise. However, in the last few elections, it has been observed that institutions/ establishments etc. do not provide paid holidays or concessions. This deprives many voters of their right to vote, which is very dangerous for democracy.
As per the order issued by the Election Commission of India, 166-Andheri, East Assembly Constituency in Maharashtra. The by-election will be held on November 3, 2022. In order to enable all voters to exercise their right to vote in this election, the following orders are being issued: Workers/ officers/ employees who are voters in the polling area where the election is to be held, shall be given leave to exercise their franchise on the day of election even if they are working outside the area where the election is to be held for the purpose of work.
The holiday will be applicable to all establishments, factories, shops, etc. under the Industries, Energy and Labour Departments (e.g. Private companies, establishments, all shops and other establishments, residential hotels, eateries, theatres, trade, industrial enterprises or other establishments as well as information and technology companies, shopping centres, malls, retailers, etc.
