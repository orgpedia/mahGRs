Chief Minister Solar Agriculture Pump Scheme.
The Government of Maharashtra
Department of Industry, Energy and Labour
Government Resolution No:- SOURP-2018/ PR No.401/ ENERGY-7
Hutatma Rajguru Chowk, Madam Cama Road
Ministry, Mumbai- 400 032.
The date: November 15, 2018.
The Proposal:
Along with the decision taken to implement the Atal Solar Krishi Pump Scheme in the state, the state government has approved the creation of a new solar agriculture pump scheme by utilising the budgetary allocation of the department and funds under the Special Component Plan/ Tribal Appropriation for SC/ ST beneficiaries to install 1 lakh solar agriculture pumps in the state.
A total of 40,68,220 agricultural pump consumers are being supplied electricity by MSEDCL in the state at the end of March 2017. These consumers have consumed a total of 30306.72 million units of electricity during 2017-18. At the end of November 2017, 2,24,219 consumers in the state are pending for payment of electricity connection to agricultural pumps. The average farmer earns Rs. 1.07 per unit and on an average, the government is paying Rs. The power tariff is Rs 1.60 per unit. Further, on an average, the industrial, commercial and domestic consumers with higher consumption will have to pay Rs. 3.72 per unit of cross subsidy. In 2017-18, the government had allocated Rs. 4870.04 crore has been provided through cross subsidy from other consumers. 8096 crore. 63 KVA/ 100 KVA capacity electric rohitras are installed to supply power to all these krishi pumps and the power is supplied to the krishi pumps through a small pressure channel on that rohitra. Problems like low pressure power supply due to increase in the length of the short pressure line, frequent breakdowns in the power supply leading to power outages, increasing technical power losses, increasing the rate of power failure, power accidents, power theft, etc., create difficulties in achieving the goal of uninterrupted and sustainable power supply.
Apart from this, where there is no electricity network, agricultural pumps are also run using diesel fuel. Increased fuel prices, import costs, and foreign exchange rates are also factors to be considered.
As an alternative to this, the government was considering to implement the" Chief Minister Solar Agriculture Pump Scheme" in the state on a large scale so that farmers could overcome all the above problems and get its visible benefits in the future.

Government's decision
In order to make it possible for the farmers to irrigate during the day and to achieve the goal of saving the state government's traditional cost of connecting the agricultural pump and the subsidy provided by the state government, the government has decided to provide 1 lakh solar agricultural pumps without transmission to the farmers of the state in a phased manner.
" Mukhyamantri Solar Krishi Pump Yojana" will be a fully state government scheme.
Under this scheme, one lakh solar agricultural pumps will be installed in a phased manner in the next three years. In the first phase, 25,000 solar pumps will be installed, in the second phase, 50,000 solar pumps will be installed and in the third phase, 25,000 solar pumps will be installed.
Each phase will be implemented within 18 months from the date of commencement.
2. Type-wise determination of target horsepower
Considering the past experience, expected demand and cost of solar agricultural pump schemes in general, out of the 25,000 solar agricultural pumps to be installed in the first phase for 2018-19, 75 percent of the pumps i.e. 18,750 nos will be of 5 horsepower capacity and 25 percent of the pumps i.e. 6,250 nos will be of 3 horsepower capacity. Out of these, 3 HP 6,250 nos of DC pumps, 3,750 nos of AC pumps and 15,000 nos of DC pumps are planned to be installed in the ratio of 20:80 of the total targets of 5HP.
3. Class-wise determination of beneficiaries for material objectives and funds required:
The cost of the pump as per the above target for the first phase of 25,000 solar agricultural pumps to be implemented in 2018-19 is as per the base price fixed by the Central Government in June, 2018 and the financial burden has been calculated accordingly.
The target of 25,000 solar agricultural pumps fixed in the first phase has been divided into beneficiary category-wise by taking into account the population of SC/ ST persons and the population of general persons in the" Economic Survey of Maharashtra 2017-18" of the state government.
