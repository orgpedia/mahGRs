Reference:- State Election Commission, Maharashtra No. Rania/ JIPPANS-2019/ Q. No.31/ K.7, Dy. letter dated December 27, 2019.
Our country has adopted a democratic system and all registered people above the age of 18 are expected to cast 100 per cent votes in every election. In view of this, as per Section 135B of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, on the day of poll, the electors are generally given leave to exercise their franchise or in some cases are given suitable relaxation in working hours. However, in the last few elections, it has been observed that institutions/ establishments etc. do not provide paid holidays or concessions. This deprives many voters of their right to vote, which is very dangerous for democracy.
As per the order of the State Election Commission. The General Election is scheduled to be held on 7th January, 2020 as mentioned in Annexure-I. In order to enable all the electors to exercise their right to vote in the said election, it is hereby ordered as under: 1) The workers/ officers/ employees who are electors in the polling area where the election is to be held, shall be given additional leave to exercise their right to vote on the day of election, even if they are working outside the election area for the purpose of work.
(ii) This holiday will be applicable to all establishments, factories, shops etc. under the Department of Industries, Energy and Labour (e.g. (iii) In exceptional circumstances, where it is not possible to grant full day leave to workers, officers, employees etc., workers in the polling area may be given a relaxation of at least two hours in lieu of leave to exercise their franchise. However, prior permission of the District Collector and the District Election Officer will be required for the same. In any case, the owners of the establishment concerned will have to ensure that the voters get at least two hours of relaxation for voting.
(iv) The above instructions shall be strictly complied with by the owners/ managements of all establishments, factories, shops etc. under the Industries, Power and Labour Department as mentioned above.
