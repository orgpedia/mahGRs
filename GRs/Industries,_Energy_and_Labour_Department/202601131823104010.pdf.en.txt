Government Circular Our country has adopted a democratic system and all registered citizens over the age of 18 are expected to vote in every election. In view of this, in exercise of the powers conferred on the Government of Maharashtra by Notification No. 39/1/68 -JUDL-III, dated 8th May 1968, of the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India, referred to in section AQ of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (26 of 1881), the day of poll is generally observed as a paid holiday to enable the electors to exercise their right to vote or, in some cases, as appropriate, during working hours.
