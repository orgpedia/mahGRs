The Proposal:
Boost to industrial development in Vidarbha, Marathwada, North Maharashtra, D& D+ areas
The discount in electricity tariff for industrial consumers in the region was implemented under the government decision at serial number 2 in the context. Accordingly, fuel adjustment sizing concession to industrial consumers, efficiency based concession to industries and incentive to new industries are being provided with effect from 01.04.2016. The scheme is valid till March 31, 2019. As per the provisions of Section-65 of the Electricity Act, 2003, this concession is being compensated to MSEDCL as financial assistance.
There is still a need to increase efficiency, investment, modernization by providing existing concessions to industrial customers operating in Vidarbha, Marathwada, North Maharashtra, D and D+ areas. This will lead to higher employment generation, higher tax revenues and higher employment opportunities. It will also help in improving the quality of life of the people.
Only 14% of industrial consumers in the state are from Vidarbha and 10% of industrial consumers are from the state.
It is in Marathwada. Therefore, there is still a lot of scope for industrial development in this area and it is not possible to see more growth in just three years. Therefore, the extension of the scheme till March 31, 2024 will lead to the growth of new industries in Vidarbha, Marathwada, North Maharashtra, D and D+ areas.
Vidarbha, Marathwada, North Maharashtra, D and D+ areas
