Government Decision No: Solar P-2024 / Q.11 / Energy-7
Madame Cama Road, Hutatma Rajguru Chowk, Mantralaya, Mumbai-400 032.
Date: 15th March, 2024.
Read: - Letter No.M.A. (w) / Upsa Irrigation Scheme / 001789, D. 17.01.2024
The Proposal: -
This is due to the fact that about 53 per cent of the state's population depends on agriculture and allied sectors for their livelihood.
The area is very important. Efficient and effective use of water resources for sustainable development of the region.
The empowerment of small landholding farmers, etc. is also important. The lives of farmers
Upsa irrigation in the state to help them increase agricultural income for uplifting
The customers. Relaxation in the power tariff fixed by the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission by the state government.
is provided. The revenue loss to the MSEDCL on account of this shortfall will be compensated by the government.
MSE distribution is done by giving a subsidy per unit to the company. The burden of periodic power tariff hikes is also borne by subsidies provided by the government.
With the increasing industrialization and urbanization of the state, the demand for electricity is increasing day by day. or
Electricity is being generated mainly from traditional sources such as coal, water, petroleum products, natural gas. These energy resources are limited and will be exhausted in the future. The use of such energy sources is contributing significantly to air pollution. This is causing everyone to suffer the undesirable effects of global warming and environmental change. The alternative is non-traditional.
This is to increase the energy source. The central government's policy has set a target of generating 43 per cent of energy from non-conventional fuel sources by 2030 as per the national benchmark.
Solar for the energy required to extract water under the project in Upasa Irrigation Schemes
Energy needs to be maximized. Additional land is available in the project area for this purpose.
If so, it will be used to set up solar power plants.
The solar electrification of the Upasa irrigation schemes has resulted in a national cost of £7881 517'9, £9771 /.
The goal will be achieved. The subsidy provided on this will help in reducing the burden on the state.
About 17561 acres of land is available with the Water Resources Department (/ /). The use of solar energy
can be used to build the project. Solar energy is used because of its low-cost availability of electricity.
There will be sustainable development of the state. For this, all the high and very high pressures in the state will be removed.
The issue of solarisation of irrigation schemes was under consideration of the government.

Government Decision No: Solar P-2024 / Q.11 / Energy-7
The Government's Decisions:
1. Solarization of all High-Pressure and High-Pressure Drainage Irrigation Schemes in Maharashtra
The plan is being approved. A total of Rs. A project cost of ₹4208 crore is also being approved.
2. The State Government is approving grant-in-aid of ₹3366 crore to MSEDCL over two years i.e. 2024-25 and 2025-26.
3. The land required for the solar power project is given to the MSE by the Water Resources Department.
to be transferred.
4. The MSEDCL and the Water Resources Department have sanctioned Rs. Maharashtra Electricity
The necessary permission of the regulatory commission should be obtained.
5. The MSE should take necessary action to implement the project.
The objectives of the scheme are: -
Reducing the subsidy burden by producing 1,7881,1809.
2. Drawing up a long-term, financially viable plan.
Reducing carbon emissions.
4. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions under climate change.
5. Reduce dependence on conventional energy sources.
4. Total solar capacity required for solarization of existing Upasa Irrigation Scheme.
It is as follows: -
