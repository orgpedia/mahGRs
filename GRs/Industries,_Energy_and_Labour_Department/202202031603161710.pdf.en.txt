Read: 1. VACHE- (2006/ (1160)/ INDUSTRY-2, dated 10/08/2006 2) Memorandum No. F- 1/5/2016 SEZ, dated 14/07/2016, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Department of Commerce, Government of India
The Proposal:
The Special Economic Zones Act, 2005 was promulgated on 23/06/2005. Recommendation of proposals for development of Special Economic Zones under the said Act to the Central Government through the State Government.
It was necessary. In this regard, before recommending the proposals, it is expected from the developers to ensure that the area reservation, whether the SEZ is notified as eco-sensitive area or how all facilities like water/ electricity etc. are available or can be made available. The Departmental Scrutiny Committee was constituted vide Government Resolution dated 10/08/2006 under the Chairmanship of the Minister (Industries). The committee included the Urban Development Department, Revenue Department and Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation as members to expedite the concessions given to SEZs or the permissions required from other departments.
It has been more than 15 years since the Government issued the decision to constitute the Scrutiny Committee as above. After the release of the Central Government's Special Economic Zones Act 2005, there was a huge response to the scheme from 2006 to 2008.
The number of proposals received by the government during the period was very high. Global recession after 2008, changes in tax structure and Special Economic Zones Act, 2005
Period of relaxation under Section 10AA of Income Tax Act for the area as on 31/03/2020
The demand for developing special economic zones is relatively low due to expiration, etc.

It's happened. Also, the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) permits are easily available at one place under a single window scheme. Therefore, in the present circumstances, the matter of cancellation of the Government decision dated 10/08/2006 was under consideration of the Government as a lot of time was being wasted in the process of submitting the proposals received in this regard to the Scrutiny Committee in a cyclical manner and recommending the same to the Central Government.
