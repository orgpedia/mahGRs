About 78% of the geographical area of Gadchiroli district is covered by dense forest. The population of the district is sparse and the villages are far from each other. As a result, the power supply to villages in remote and tribal areas has gone through the forest. Under natural conditions like wind, storm, wind and rain, trees and branches in the forest fall on power lines, causing frequent breakdowns of power lines in the forest, delaying the repair and restoration of power supply. As a result, power supply to most of the tribal habitations in the district is frequently disrupted, making it difficult for the people of these areas to get regular and uninterrupted power supply. Kotgul (Dholdongri) in Gadchiroli district to reduce the length of power lines and reduce the additional load on them with a view to provide uninterrupted and regular power supply to the last consumer. Korchi, Kamalapur Tt. Aheri, Peramilli Ta. Bhamragad and Regunta. A new 33/11 KV power sub-station needs to be constructed at Sironcha.

As the power line passes through the forest, the trees and branches of the forest fall on the power lines in natural conditions like wind, storm, wind and rain, so the power lines in the forest are frequently broken and the repair of those lines and the supply of electricity is delayed. As a result, the power supply to the area is frequently disrupted, making it difficult for the residents to get regular and uninterrupted power supply. It is also necessary to provide uninterrupted and adequate power supply in this area due to the presence of wild animals. With a view to provide uninterrupted and regular power supply to the last consumer in Vadakki, the length of the power lines should be reduced to reduce the additional load on them. 33/11 KV at Yavatmal
