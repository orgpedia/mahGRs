Accordingly, the Directorate General of Industries is in the process of opening a separate head of account for the expenditure incurred in connection with the operation and maintenance of the" State Export Promotion Council." This is likely to take some time. Also, the Ministry of Commerce of the Central Government has instructed to immediately form an export steering committee at the district level to promote exports. Therefore, it is necessary to open a new head of account to meet the expenditure for the purpose of the said State Export Promotion Council/ Committee.
However, it cannot be ruled out that it will take some time. Accordingly, in view of the aforesaid instructions issued by the Central Government to the Directorate General of Industries, the expenditure incurred in pursuance of the Maharashtra Export Promotion Council/ Committee as recommended by the Directorate General of Industries, should be provisionally met from the provisions approved for this year in the Head Accounts Head mentioned below for the Maitri Cell.
