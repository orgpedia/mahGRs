Support for meeting the Power Purchase Obligation (RPO), by reducing the power purchase rate and power tariff.
The reduction in the financial burden of subsidies and the reduction in the rate of farm inputs has led to a reduction in the amount of cross-subsidy.
Recognizing the long-term benefits of the scheme, it will also help reduce industrial and commercial prices.
It is necessary to increase the scope and speed of this scheme. One hundred of this scheme is in the state of Maharashtra.
Percentage of farm pump consumers to benefit from the earlier minimum of 7000 MW solar power capacity generation.
The target needs to be increased to 16000 MW of solar power capacity.
Also under Mukhyamantri Baliraja Free Electricity Scheme vide Government Decision dated 25.07.2024.
2024 has been launched. Accordingly, the burden of the electricity bill on the farmers should be borne.
The government has decided to increase the power capacity of 44.6 lakh farmers in the state to 7.5 horsepower.
The farm pumps will be provided with electricity completely free of cost. For this, Rs. Annual grant of Rs 14,761 crore
will be available in the form. But under Mukhyamantri Solar Krishi Vahini Yojana 2.0.
The average power purchase rate of MSEDCL will come down once the project is commissioned.
Subsidies to be provided by the Government for agriculture and industrial sector in the future.
The financial burden will be less. Hence, the Mukhyamantri Baliraja Electricity Rate Concession Scheme was successfully implemented.
