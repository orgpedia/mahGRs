Orders have been issued from time to time by the Urban Development Department, General Administration Department and Industries, Energy and Labour Department and this department to implement the recommendations made by the Lad-Page Committee for the educational, economic and social upliftment of sanitation workers. However, many cases under the policy of the Lad-Page Committee of the Department of Social Justice are received at the governance level for guidance from various companies under the Department of Energy. The above cases are then referred to the Social Justice Department for guidance. It consumes a lot of time. Accordingly, a proposal was under consideration of the Government to constitute a Committee at the Government level to provide guidance/ advice.
