This Government has decided to grant the second extension of the deadline for registration of projects under the 2016 Policy with the General Authority till 30th June, 2021 subject to the following conditions:

(2) The promoters of the projects which have not yet been registered by submitting their complete proposals to the General Authority.
The maximum period of 30th June, 2021 should be given by sending a notice (if one wants to take advantage of permissible incentives under the 2015 policy).
3) The Chief Minister should review the projects approved during the period of their various non-conventional policies and submit their year-wise, resource-wise and policy-wise list of projects to the Department of Energy, and thereby give information about the number of projects and their pending liabilities for various incentives.
The policy proposals should be submitted along with the benefits and drawbacks of the incomplete projects by 30th June, 2021 after taking into account their project completion period, including the time by which such projects were required to be completed, with a view to immediately closing such projects (pending liability of permissible incentives) i.e. the grant of the policy would not be permissible to them.
