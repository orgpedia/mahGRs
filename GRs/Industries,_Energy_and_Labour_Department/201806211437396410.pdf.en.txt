Introduction: Recognizing the unique importance of generating electricity from new and renewable energy sources, the Government of India has announced a target of expanding the country's power generation from such energy sources to 175 GW by 2022. This includes 100 GW of solar power generation. In this regard, power generation programmes from new and renewable energy sources are to be taken up across the country and the States.
There are plenty of new and renewable energy sources in the country. Besides wind and solar, electricity can be generated from sources such as sugarcane husk, agricultural waste, organic waste, medical waste, industrial waste including mineral and other waste. Keeping in view the importance of all these sources, a comprehensive policy has been announced on 20th July, 2015 for promotion of power generation from wind energy, sugarcane straw/ agro residue based cogeneration projects, small hydro power projects, agricultural waste, organic waste, medical waste, industrial waste including mineral and other waste, power generation projects and power generation from solar energy.
In view of the growing demand for energy in the state, the development of new and renewable energy sources is inevitable. There is a huge scope for floating solar power projects in the state by utilising the surface of rivers/ seas/ dams which are available in large quantities due to certain limitations in utilisation of available natural resources on land. Keeping this in view, the State Government has sanctioned Rs.1000 crore to Ujani Dam, Solapur district. MSEDCL has been designated as the implementing agency for setting up floating solar power plants of capacity. MSEDCL has invited Expression of Interest (EOI) for the project. Accordingly, some suggestions are being received from the interested parties. The Government was contemplating to constitute a Committee to consider these suggestions and to determine all aspects/ functions/ procedures/ implementation required for setting up of floating solar power plants considering the limited experience in this field regarding new technologies of floating solar power plants.
Government Decision: 1000th May on Ujani Dam, Solapur District. The Government is approving the constitution of the following Committees to determine all the aspects/ functions/ procedures/ implementation required for setting up of floating solar power plants of capacity viz.
