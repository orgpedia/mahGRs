The Proposal:
Narayan Meghaji Lokhande Maharashtra Institute of Labour Sciences offers a full-time diploma course in Labour Organization and Industrial Relations for a duration of 9 months. The institute also offers a two-year Master of Labour Studies (MLS) postgraduate degree course affiliated to the University of Mumbai. A state level entrance examination is conducted by the institute for admission to the undergraduate courses. A total of 52 students are selected for admission to MLS Part-1 on the basis of merit in this entrance examination. Further, provision for direct admission without admission process to one student who has passed first class in the Diploma Course on' Trade Unions and Industrial Relations' has been made in the Government Resolution No. 2. MLI 0708/ S.No.44/ Workers-6D It is dated July 17, 2008.
Most of the candidates who join the Diploma Course in Trade Unions and Industrial Relations are employed as employees in various establishments. They are relieved by the management for a period of only 9 months and are active workers of trade unions. The candidate who has passed the examination with first class first is not eligible for admission to the two-year full-time post-graduate course in MLS. As a result, the space is empty.
To ensure that the seat does not remain vacant and the student who has passed the first class gets a chance for higher education, the students who have passed the first class should apply for the MLS.
If you do not enter the course, you will have the opportunity to pass the second class in the first class.
