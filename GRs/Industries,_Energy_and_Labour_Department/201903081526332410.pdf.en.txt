No.238/ Energy-5 dated 23.11.2017 4. Department of Cooperation, Marketing and Textiles, Government Resolution No: Policy-2018/ PR. No.1649/ TEX-5 dated 21.12.2018.
Preamble: Concession in power tariff for industrial consumers in Vidarbha, Marathwada, North Maharashtra, D and D+ areas vide Government Resolution No. Power is being provided by the department under 1, 2 and 3. Further, under the Textile Policy- 2018-23, Government Decision No. Under Section 4, the process of providing electricity tariff concession to the textile units in the state is underway. It was observed that after the concessions of these two departments were given to the textile units of Vidarbha, their resultant power tariff was even lower than the subsidized power tariff of the agricultural consumer. If these two concessions are implemented together, the textile industry in the rest of Maharashtra will face unbalanced competition compared to Vidarbha and Marathwada regions. Some of the textile units in the rest of the state will either shut down or shift to Vidarbha, Marathwada regions and that will not be practical. Further, as per the Textile Policy, the Textile units are expected to run the project on solar energy in the next three years through energy conservation. However, it was also pointed out that if the concessions of the Energy and Textile departments are combined, the resultant power tariff for the textile sector will be less than Rs.1/- per unit, and these industries will not be able to generate energy through non-conventional energy sources and the government's policy of energy conservation will not be successful. In this regard, the government was considering to revise the power tariff of the textile units. Accordingly, the above Government Resolution No. Section 2 of No. Section 2 will be added as follows:
Government Decision: After applying the permissible concession given by the Government including the Department of Energy and Textiles to the working and new textile units in Vidarbha, Marathwada, North Maharashtra, D and D+ areas, the resultant electricity tariff shall not be less than Rs. This concession should be applicable from the power consumption of January 2019.
