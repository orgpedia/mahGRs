Department of Industry, Energy and Labour,
Government Resolution No. Asanka 1119/ Q.No.110/ Kam.7A
Madam Cama Marg, Hutatma Rajguru Chowk,
Ministry, Mumbai 400 032.
The date: September 13, 2019.
The Proposal:
Sugar industry is a major industry in the state of Maharashtra and at present, there are about 8 lakh sugarcane workers employed in about 101 cooperative sector and 87 private sector sugar mills operating in the state. Most of the sugarcane workers are from the Marathwada region, especially Beed district, and have migrated to different districts of the state.
Despite the fact that sugarcane workers are paid wages and other benefits as per the MOU signed at the level of Maharashtra State Sugar Mills Union, sugarcane workers do not get the benefits of social security schemes like Provident Fund, Workers State Insurance Scheme, Gratuity, Compensation, Anugrah Gratuity etc. Also, their children and families do not get the benefits of any social schemes. Since the life of these sugarcane workers and their families was unstable and very difficult, the government was considering to provide benefits of various welfare schemes to the sugarcane workers in the sugarcane crushing business to make their life comfortable, raise their living standards and make their life stable and safe. The Government intended to set up a Corporation to look into the various demands of sugarcane workers and to plan and implement schemes to provide them benefits of various welfare and social security schemes.
Government's decision
The government has decided to set up Gopinath Munde Sugarcane Workers' Corporation to provide benefits of various welfare and social security schemes for sugarcane workers in the state.
Gopinath Munde has been appointed as the President of Sugarcane Workers Corporation along with Keshavrao Yadavrao Andhale, former Member of Legislative Assembly.
