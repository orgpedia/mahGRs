Introduction: - The state of Maharashtra is an agrarian state. In the state, the area of agriculture was spread all over and in remote areas.
The aim of the government is to provide power supply to agricultural consumers at affordable prices by creating and empowering the necessary infrastructure and providing power supply to agricultural consumers as per the demand for power connections for agricultural pumps.
There are about 45 lakh agricultural power consumers in the state of Maharashtra. in the country's solar power pumps.
Maharashtra accounts for the largest share. Agriculture accounts for about 22 per cent of the total energy consumption in the state, mainly used to power agricultural pumps. At present, farmers are supplied with electricity during the day and night on a cyclic basis. This is how electricity is supplied.
Farmers face a lot of inconvenience, irrigation during the night, wild animals, snake bites, etc., to solve these problems, there is a demand for electricity supply during the day.
It is done continuously by the farmers.
The "Mukhyamantri Solar Krishi Vahini Yojana" was launched under a government decision dated 14 June 2017 to electrify the farmers of the state with a view to providing them electricity supply at affordable prices and at convenient times. In view of the difficulties faced in the implementation of the scheme, the revised Mukhyamantri Solar Krishi Vahini Yojana-2.0 dated 8th May, 2023 has been launched with a view to provide daytime power supply to the farmers of the state. About 7000 MW of decentralized solar to bring at least 30% of agricultural power lines on solar power by December, 2025
The goal is to set up a power plant.
The state of Maharashtra has an average annual demand of 1. 00 to 1. 25 lakh agricultural pumps and new power connections are provided as per the seniority list. Number of agricultural consumers up to 31.11.2023 in the state 48.16
It is so much.

"Mukhyamantri Solar Krishi Vahini Yojana 2.0 (. 5 < / 4-2.0) "199 $1 of this state government." The plan
"Empowerment of the power distribution system" in the traditional manner for smooth implementation and
Asian Development Bank (ADB) PSA for the scheme 'Prompt Power Connections to Agricultural Pumps'.
The issue of sanctioning loans was under consideration of the government.
Government Decision: 1. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ The scheme is being approved for "Strengthening of Power Distribution System for Solar Energization and Traditional Power Connection to Farmers' Agriculture Pumps" to empower and capacity-building of existing power distribution systems to make solar power available to farmers during the day and to provide traditional power connection to pending agricultural pumps with payment.
The preliminary project report (22?) of the scheme is 08091 for approval of the Central Government. 17 of 0010110 85 () ₹/) is being approved for sending.
The scheme will be implemented through MSEDCL with a total outlay of Rs.2200 crores as per various components viability 990 51519 (59) (Viable Difference Fund) of 30% of the project cost of solar power generation, Rs.7600 crores for power distribution system empowerment, Rs.1000 crores for conventional power connection to power pumps, Rs.150 crores for SCADA Wrest HGRaT SI goo crores, Rs.150 crores for battery energy storage on pilot basis and Rs.3Y crores for Project Implementation Assistance. Project cost of ₹11585 crore is being approved.
Out of the total amount required for this scheme, 70 per cent of the total amount required is Rs. 8109 crores (US $977 million) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) at the prevailing market rate of interest and 30 per cent of the scheme funds to the MSEs. 3476 crores is being sanctioned to the MSEDCL out of the budgetary outlay of the State Government for this year.
(6) Provide uninterrupted and regular power supply to the agricultural pump customers during the day; supply the power required for the agricultural pump with electricity generated from non-conventional sources. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ The objectives of the scheme are to empower the existing power distribution system to make solar power available to farmers during the day, to provide traditional power connections to 500,000 solar pumps as per schedule, to reduce power leakages by reducing the length of distribution channels due to the generation of decentralized renewable energy (981008 180/8018 516199), to reduce the cost of power procurement, to provide 30 of the project cost as State Assistance Fund by the Government of Maharashtra for solar power generation, to use electricity during peak demand by storing surplus energy batteries and automation of power distribution networks such as the HY ATA SCADA system and LANA 90 700 centre BUR.

6. Components covered under the scheme: - 1) Projects for generation of solar energy under Mukhyamantri Solar Krishi Yojana 2.0.
Providing 30% of the cost 1 _ 77 _ 7 Gap 55 _ 0 _ 7 (/ 7 _ (viable difference fund)).
(The approximate cost is Rs. 2200 crores).
2). 4 By making solar energy available to farmers during the day under the $9/4-2.0 scheme
Empowerment of existing power distribution systems for distribution (approx.
The cost is Rs. 7600 crore) and traditional power to 5 lakh farmers' agricultural pumps.
to provide connection. (The approximate cost is Rs. 1000 crores).
3) Construction of 8509495 system (estimated cost Rs. 600 crores).
4) To build a 20 MWh battery energy storage system on an experimental basis (8585) (approx.
Rs.150 crores)
5) Support for project implementation (200] 8609 [] \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 7. 7.) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0. 555 [8 | 106] (Rs. 35 crores).
The works are covered under this project.
7. The plan outlay is Rs. The detailed projects of the scheme are more than 10 crores.
