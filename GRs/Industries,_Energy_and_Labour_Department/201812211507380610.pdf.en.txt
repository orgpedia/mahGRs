The Government of Maharashtra
Department of Industry, Energy and Labour
Government Resolution No: SANKIRN-2018/ PR No.117/ ENERGY-5
Madame Cama Road, Hutatma Rajguru Chowk, Mantralaya, Mumbai- 400 032.
Date is December 20, 2018.
The Proposal:
The state-owned power generation, transmission and distribution companies are Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited (MTNL) and Mahavitaran Mahavidyalaya Limited (MMRL). For this, power infrastructure is being set up at the required places in the state through these companies. Various taxes are levied by the respective Gram Panchayats, Municipalities and Municipal Corporations on these power infrastructure. Since the burden of these taxes is included in the Gross Annual Revenue Requirement (ARR) of the power companies, it is in turn included in the electricity tariff, resulting in an increase in the power tariff. Since the important work of providing uninterrupted and smooth power supply to the people of the state and providing electricity to the last mile in the state is being done by these government companies, the government was considering to exempt the government electricity companies from the levy of tax by making necessary amendments in the relevant acts, rules and orders of the concerned gram panchayat, municipality or municipal corporation so that no tax should be levied on the overhead lines, underground lines, distribution rooftops, electric poles, electric towers and transmission lines erected by these companies in the limits of the gram panchayat, municipality and municipal corporation. The proposal was presented in the cabinet meeting held on November 29, 2018. The government has taken the decision in line with the cabinet's decision.
Government's decision:
Under the Department of Energy, the government power companies and their franchisees are being approved by the concerned department to make appropriate amendments in the relevant acts, rules and orders so that no tax is levied by the Gram Panchayats, Municipalities and Municipalities for the power distribution infrastructure (overhead lines, underground lines, distribution lines, electric poles, power towers, transmission lines, etc.) being constructed by them.
2. The Rural Development Department and the Urban Development Department should take necessary further action in accordance with the above decision.
