The Proposal: -
The state of Maharashtra is an agrarian state. The area under agriculture in the state is spread all over and in remote areas. The aim of the government is to provide electricity to agricultural consumers at affordable prices by creating and empowering the necessary infrastructure and providing power supply to agricultural pumps according to the demand for power connections for agricultural pumps.
There are about 45 lakh agricultural power consumers in the state of Maharashtra. Maharashtra accounts for the largest share of solar power pumps in the country. Agriculture accounts for about 22 per cent of the total energy consumption in the state, which is mainly used to supply electricity to agricultural pumps. At present, farmers are supplied with electricity during the day and night on a cyclic basis. Farmers face a lot of inconvenience due to the supply of electricity in this way, there is a constant demand from the farmers to supply electricity during the day to solve the problems of wild animals, snake bites, etc. during the night time irrigation. This problem can be solved by installing a solar pump without transmission.
Also, the government has undertaken a programme of isolation and solarisation of the agricultural channel to supply power to farmers during the day. Under this, a solar plant of ambient capacity will be set up near the power sub-station to provide reliable and quality power supply during the day to the nearby agricultural pumps.
This will help the traditional agricultural pump run on solar power during the day.
In order to provide reliable and uninterrupted power supply to the farmers during the day, 5 lakh transmission-free solar krishi pumps to be installed and traditional krishi pump power connections to be distributed over a period of 5 years, and to implement the associated schemes for solar energy of the krishi channel and to make available the required funds. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 8 The issue of taking loans from banks was under the consideration of the government.
