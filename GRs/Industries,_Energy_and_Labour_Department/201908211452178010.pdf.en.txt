the proposal received.
The Proposal:
Recognizing the critical importance of generating electricity from new and renewable energy sources, the Union Government has set a target of expanding the country's power generation from such sources to 175 GW by 2022. This includes 100 GW of solar and 60 GW of wind energy. In this regard, programmes for generation of electricity from new and renewable energy sources are to be taken up across the country and the States.
The state has abundant new and renewable energy resources. Besides wind and solar, electricity can be generated from sources such as sugarcane chips, agricultural waste, organic waste, medical waste, industrial waste including mineral and other waste. Keeping in view the importance and potential of all these sources, a consolidated policy for promotion of transmission linked projects like wind power generation, sugarcane straw/ agro residue based power generation plants, small hydro power generation plants, agricultural waste, organic waste/ medical waste/ industrial waste including mineral and other waste and solar power generation plants has been announced on 20th July, 2015.
In view of the growing demand for energy in the state, maximum development of new and renewable (non-conventional) energy sources is inevitable. We need to make optimum use of available resources. In line with this, a large amount of land can be made available in the state in place of small hydroelectric projects at various dams (hydroelectric projects set up with the help of developers). Considering the fact that there is a huge scope for setting up solar/ wind power projects on such land, the proposal received from the Water Resources Department was under consideration of the Government to constitute a committee to determine all the aspects/ functions/ procedures/ implementation/ financial viability of the project/ power tariff/ registration of the project etc. required for setting up of solar-wind power projects on the land of such small hydroelectric projects.
