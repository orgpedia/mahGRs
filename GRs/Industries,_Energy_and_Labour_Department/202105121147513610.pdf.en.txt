Government Resolution No: SOURP-2019/ PR No.268/ ENERGY-7
Under this scheme, 30 percent financial assistance will be provided by the central government on the amount less than the base price or tender price of the pump.
However, under the earlier Centrally Sponsored Scheme of" Atal Solar Krishi Pump," the share of beneficiary farmers was 5% and the State Government's share was 10%. Under the scheme, the state government's share is 10 percent and the beneficiary share is 10 percent. The remaining share of financial assistance for these schemes has been made available by increasing the power sale tax per unit by 1.04 paisa per unit from urban industrial and commercial power consumers and 10 paisa per unit from urban and rural industrial and commercial power consumers respectively, under the Maharashtra Sales Tax on Sale of Electricity Act, 1963. It is being approved to provide the remaining funds for the proposed scheme by continuing the said additional power sales tax per unit.
Objective of component B of the Mission:
As announced by the Hon'ble Deputy Chief Minister and Minister (Finance) in the Budget Speech of 2020-21 and while approving the recently announced Agriculture Power Linkage Policy, the Hon'ble Cabinet has decided to install five lakh solar agriculture pumps in the state in the next five years. Under this mission, it is planned to install 90 percent of transmission-less solar agricultural pumps. This includes 1,00,000 solar agriculture pumps sanctioned by the Central Government under KUSUM missions. If the number of pumps sanctioned by the Central Government increases in the next period, it should be included in the 5,00,000 pumps to be covered under this mission.
(2) Horse power, type-wise determination and category-wise allocation of target-
In general, considering the past experience, expected demand and price, 60 percent of the pumps will be of 3 horsepower capacity, 30 percent of the pumps will be of 5 horsepower capacity and 10 percent of the pumps will be of 7.5 horsepower capacity. Accordingly, targets of 3,00,000 for 3HP, 1,50,000 for 5HP and 50,000 for 7.5 HP are being set for 5 years. All category of solar agri pumps will be DC pumps.
22.5 per cent of the total target will be reserved for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes subject to the approval of the Central Government. Their population ratio has been revised to 13.5 per cent and 9 per cent, respectively. The remaining 77.5 per cent is to be distributed to general category beneficiaries. Accordingly, a total of 5,00,000 solar agriculture pumps at the state level should be allocated to the general, scheduled caste and scheduled tribe beneficiaries in 3HP, 5HP and 7.5 HP as per the target statement" A" and according to its type.
Out of the above targets, 50% of the solar agri-pumps will be allocated to 34 districts based on their population and first-come-first-serve basis. The remaining 50 per cent of the solar pumps will be distributed to the farmers in the district where the target is met. If a district is unable to meet the target of a district, the power to reallocate the remaining pumps in that district. The State Level Steering Committee will be headed by the Minister (Power). The distribution of solar agricultural pumps in the district should be done on the basis of" first-come-first-serve."
