Madam Cama Marg, Hutatma Rajguru Chowk,
Ministry, Mumbai 400 032.
Date: December 7, 2023.
The Proposal:
The then Bombay Provincial Government established the Labour Commissionerate in the year 1921 with the objective of resolving various issues of the workers in the State and to establish harmonious and peaceful relations by bringing about a rapprochement between the employers' unions and the workers. Initially, the offices of Directorate of Industrial Safety and Health, Directorate of Vapour, etc. were functioning under the administrative control of the Labour Commissioner. Thereafter, in 1987, the Directorate of Industrial Safety and Health and in 1988, the Directorate of Vaporizers were declared as Heads of Departments for administrative and financial purposes, instead of being under the control of the Office of the Labour Commissioner.
Thereafter, various offices were set up at that time as per the requirement in respect of various subjects relating to labour. These include N. M. Lokhande Institute of Labour Sciences, Maharashtra Labour Welfare Board, various Mathadi Boards, Safety Guards Boards, Maharashtra Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Board, and Industrial Courts and Labour Courts under various labour laws to protect the interests of workers.
Since the above mentioned offices are functioning at different locations in most of the districts, the workers have to go to different places for their various issues/ queries/ schemes of benefits etc. Apart from this, the working officers/ employees have to take care of other additional responsibilities while implementing the labour laws. The employees are facing various problems due to different offices at different places while handling this charge. This has adversely affected the functioning of the administration.
The above facts were discussed in the review meeting of the Labour Department held on 21.09.2022. After coming to the notice of the Minister (Labour), he mooted the idea of setting up of all the convenient" Labour Bhavans" in every district of the State for the convenience/ interest of the workers working in the organized and unorganized sectors of the State and to bring all the offices under the Labour Department under one roof.

5. Setting up of Labour Houses in every district is a matter of planning and is a long-term process. For this, the government needs land and resources.
Apart from this, it is necessary to demand government lands from the district collectors, prepare a plan plan after obtaining a no-objection certificate, prepare a concept and budget, and open a new accounting head for the availability of funds. For this, it is under the consideration of the government to take a policy decision at the department level first and give administrative approval for the construction of new labour houses at the location of every district/ headquarters in the state.
