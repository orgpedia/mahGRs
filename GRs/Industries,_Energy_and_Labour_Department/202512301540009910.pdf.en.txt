Government Circular: -
Our country has adopted a democratic system, with registered citizens over the age of 18 expected to vote in every election. In view of this, Section 135 (b) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 provides for paid leave on the day of poll to enable voters to exercise their franchise in general or reasonable relaxation of working hours in certain places. However, in the last few elections, it has been observed that KOs, some organizations / establishments etc. do not give paid leave or concessions to their workers. As a result, many voters are deprived of their right to vote, which is extremely dangerous for democracy.
2. As per the order issued by the State Election Commission. General elections will be held in 29 municipal corporations in the state on 15/01/2026. In order to enable all the electors to exercise their right to vote in these elections and also to enable all the electors in the bordering districts of the State of Maharashtra to exercise their right to vote properly, the following orders are issued: -
1) Workers / officers / employees who are voters in the polling area where the election is to be held, even if they are working outside the polling area for work, should be given paid leave to exercise their right to vote on the day of the election.
II) The holiday shall be applicable to all establishments, factories, shops, etc., falling under Industries, Energy and Labour Department (e.g. Establishments in private companies, all shops and other establishments, residential, hotel, eateries, other houses, theatres, trade, industrial undertakings or other establishments as well as IT companies, shopping centres, malls, retailers, etc.)
(l) In exceptional cases where it is not possible to give full day leave to the concerned officers, staff, workers, etc. in respect of hazardous or public service or establishments where the absence would cause great loss, the establishment owners concerned shall be required to ensure that two to three hours of special leave shall be provided in lieu of leave to exercise their right to vote.
