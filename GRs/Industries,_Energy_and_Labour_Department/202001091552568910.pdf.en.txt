Subject: Problems being faced by the Buyer Departments pursuant to the provisions of the Department of Industries dated 01.12.2016
Sir,
The revised procurement policy is being implemented in the State as per the Government decision dated 01.12.2016 of the Industries Department. Items which are procured from various departments/ offices under the State Government. In order to achieve them through competitive/ fair price, high quality and transparent procurement process, the State has made provisions in the Procurement Policy dated 30.10.2015 for uniformity in procurement process, transparency, procurement through e-tendering, procurement from Micro and Small Enterprises, procurement from Blind and Disabled Institutions, procurement from Haffkine, etc.
The revised procurement policy has been implemented in accordance with the Government decision dated 01.12.2016 of this Department, seeking feedback from various stakeholders to clear the ambiguity in the procurement policy dated 30.10.2015. All the departments/ offices under the government, district councils, municipal corporations, municipal corporations, boards, etc. have been mandated to carry out the procurement process in accordance with the provisions of the revised procurement policy. However, in view of all these factors, most of the procuring departments receive funds while implementing various schemes of the Central/ State Governments. It has been pointed out by many of the procuring departments that the problems arising in accordance with the provisions of the Government Decision dated 01.12.2016 of this Department are mainly due to non-receipt of adequate response despite repeated publication of tenders, non-qualification of tenders on technical grounds, consequent non-completion of procurement process within the stipulated time period, consequent non-utilization of Government funds, non-lapse of funds. It mainly involves the Public Health Department, Medical Education and Pharmaceuticals Department and other departments to carry out the procurement process of goods within the prescribed time frame for effective implementation of the schemes. However, while carrying out the said procurement process, difficulties arise in terms of provisions. Further, in pursuance of the provisions mentioned in paragraph 2.5 of the Procurement Policy that" any deviation or exception from the procedures and guidelines laid down in this Manual for procurement of goods shall require prior approval of the Department of Industries," some of the Buyers" Departments frequently make informal referrals to this Department while carrying out the procurement process.

3. The revised procurement policy provides detailed guidelines on the action to be taken at each stage of the procurement process. In pursuance of the procurement policy, clarity is being highlighted regarding the provisions of paragraph 4.4.3.1 regarding non-participation in the procurement process by adequate number of bidders despite publication of tender process, extension or re-issue of tender due to insufficient response and other matters.
There must be at least 3 bidders for the tender to be competitive. If less than 3 bidders have participated, at least 1 week extension should be given first. There should not be any unnecessary conditions in the tender in such a way that competition is limited at the time of publishing the tender. If less than 3 bidders have participated even after such extension, the second time extension of one week shall be granted and no extension shall be granted thereafter. However, (a) if 3 or more tenders are technically qualified, the Procurement Department will be allowed to proceed. Further, (b) in case of two tenders being technically qualified, the Department of Procurement shall be entitled to accept the difference between the actual cost of procurement and the estimated cost of procurement, if any, between (-) 20% to (+) 10%. If the price does not fall within this range, it should be returned. These provisions have been amended. However, if the emphasis is on timely completion of work, the procurement officer/ department may decide to go ahead with it even if there is less than 3 responses even after two extensions. And there are obvious reasons for it. Such provisions have been made. (1) Non-receipt of adequate response despite wide publicity to the tender and despite the fact that no restrictive conditions have been prescribed in the tender in a manner which would limit competition. (2) These specifications are essential when specifying the goods. It is not possible to relax it. (3) Not getting adequate response despite publishing the tender in national/ state level newspapers. (4) Also, the limited availability of manufacturers of specific goods to be purchased, etc.
The reasons could be a few. Possible reasons may vary from case to case and depending on the difficulties of the departments in that situation. Accordingly, the department concerned may take further necessary decisions as mentioned in the meeting of the Purchase Committee. Further, it is stated that adequate options are available to carry out the procurement process in accordance with the revised procurement policy dated 01.12.2016. It mainly mentions the provisions regarding implementation of procurement process through various modes such as single source method, Swiss challenge method, limited tender, purchase by expression of interest as urgent purchase, urgent purchase order.
Pursuant to the said provisions, the procurement process is intended to be carried out by the respective procuring departments by taking decisions at their level.
5. All the above points have been consciously mentioned in the revised procurement policy in great detail. In addition, the composition and powers of various Committees at the level of Buyer Departments have been elaborated as per the Government decision dated 01.12.2016.
If the committees of the concerned procurement department face any problem during the procurement process, the heads of the concerned departments have been given full freedom to carry out the procurement process by mentioning it in the history. Provisions have been made that the Purchase Committee will continue to function till the final stage of the procurement process.

In view of all the above, the revised procurement policy dated 01.12.2016 of this Department has prescribed self-explanatory/ detailed provisions regarding the action to be taken at each stage during the procurement process. In view of this, all the departments of the government are requested to inform this department through an informal reference only in case of very exceptional circumstances to make any deviation or exception from the provisions and guidelines issued for the purchase of goods in accordance with paragraph 2.5 of the procurement policy dated 01.12.2016 of this department or if the buyer departments face difficulties during the procurement process, the matter should be mentioned in the meeting of the concerned procurement committee and the relevant procurement process should be carried out at the department level itself.
