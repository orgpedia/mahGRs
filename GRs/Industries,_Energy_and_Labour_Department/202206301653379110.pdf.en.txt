Introduction: Considering the importance of new and renewable energy sources, the Union Government has set a target of generating 500 GW of electricity from various non-conventional energy sources by 2030. The participation of all the states will be important to achieve these targets in a time bound manner. Considering the potential of generating power from the available energy sources in the State, efforts are required to commission 27000 MW of non-conventional energy projects by 2027.
The Government has launched the Non-Conventional Energy Generation Policy-2020 to increase the amount of electricity generated from non-conventional energy sources as compared to conventional power generation. It was announced on December 31, 2020.
The policy for the year 2020 was announced by excluding the concessions being given to non-conventional energy projects under the Non-Conventional Energy Generation Policy-2015 and Policy-2016. After the announcement of this policy, the major stake holders of non-conventional energy projects had requested the government and the state government to consider the huge investment for the construction of non-conventional energy projects, the electricity generated in the state and the employment generated and the consequential benefits. Also, power generated from non-conventional energy projects in the state is costlier than in other states as the land cost in the state is higher than other states and the distribution companies in the state buy power from non-conventional energy projects to some extent to meet the non-conventional energy purchase obligation (RPO). To reduce the difference in the selling price of electricity and to provide affordable prices, it has become necessary to get financial assistance from the government in the form of concessions/ subsidies/ grant of industry status to non-conventional energy projects, etc.

Government Resolution No: APAU-2021/ PR No.224/ URJA-7
Considering all these aspects, the Government was considering to make an incentive reform by including financial assistance in the form of concessional/ subsidy to non-conventional energy projects in the" Non-Conventional Energy Generation Policy-2020" in order to establish large-scale power generation plants from non-conventional energy sources in the State and to make the State the top in the country in the field of non-conventional energy.
Government Decision: The Government is approving the following reforms/ financial support and concessions to Non-Conventional Energy Projects in the Non-Conventional Energy Generation Policy-2020:
Incentive Reforms under Non-Conventional Energy Generation Policy-2020:
As per the State's Policy-2015 and Policy-2016 for generation of electricity from new and renewable energy sources, the time limit for registration with M/ s Mahavirja has been extended twice, however, since the time limit for commissioning of the project has not been extended, in view of the Corona pandemic in the State, the Cabinet has approved one year extension from the date of approval i.e. 06.06.2022 for commissioning of 418 MW capacity projects registered with M/ s Mahavirja.
Under the State's New Non-Conventional Energy Generation Policy-2020, industries setting up self-consumption solar, wind, urban and industrial solid waste power generation and sugarcane-based power generation plants are allowed to waive off electricity charges for the first 10 years from the date of commissioning of the project.
under the State Non-Conventional Energy Policy-2020. The total target is 17,360 MW by March 31, 2027. Below is a summary of these objectives:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| A.A.  | Non-conventional energy sources                                  | Target (MW) |
| 1     | Solar power projects                                             | 12930       |
| 2     | Wind power projects                                              | 2500        |
| 3     | Cane Crop/ Agro Residue Based Co-Power Generation Projects       | 1350        |
| 4     | Small Hydro Power Projects                                       | 380         |
| 5     | Urban and Industrial Solid Waste based Power Generation Projects | 200         |
| Total | 17360                                                            |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Under the Non-Conventional Energy Generation Policy-2020, it is being approved to waive off non-farm taxes for solar and wind power generation projects.
Under the State Non-Conventional Energy Generation Policy-2020, it has been made mandatory for the power distribution companies in the state to procure 50% of the power required for their total non-conventional energy bonding (RPO) from non-conventional energy projects in the state.

It's approved. Action should be taken in this regard immediately. In the petition, Further action will be taken as per the directions of the Commission. This will be done with the approval of the Cabinet.
5) Solar power plants are being set up on unutilized land of state government corporations, agricultural universities and electricity distribution companies of the state or third parties are being allowed to sell electricity by entering into power purchase agreements as per the prevailing laws/ rules.
6) Non-transmission solar power plants installed earlier on all government/ semi-government buildings in the state are being approved to cover the cost of hybrid inverter and net metering while connecting transmission through Mahavirja from the subsidy of the Energy Department.
7) In-principle approval is being given to develop energy storage projects on a pilot basis based on solar/ wind energy through MAHAYURJ and once the latest technology in this regard is developed, MAHAYURJ should submit the proposal to the department for final approval. Further action will be taken after the approval of the cabinet.
It has been decided to extend the Non-Conventional Energy Policy-2020 till March 31, 2027 instead of March 31, 2025.
