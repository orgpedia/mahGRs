Introduction: Unorganized sector workers are the main backbone of the country's economy. The contribution of workers in the unorganized sector is huge in all economic sectors like agriculture, industry etc. The Central Government has passed the Unorganized Workers Social Security Act, 2008 on 31.12.2008 with the objective of providing social security to the unorganized workers. According to the fourth annual employment-unemployment survey released by the Labour Bureau, Chandigarh in 2014, there are 3,65,25, 149 unorganized workers in the state of Maharashtra. In order to fulfill the objective of bringing these unorganized workers into the mainstream of the society, the Government of Maharashtra under the provisions of Section 6 of the Unorganized Workers Social Security Act, 2008 has constituted" Maharashtra State Social Security Board" under the Maharashtra Unorganized Workers Social Security Rules, 2013. As per the Supreme Court order, the Central Government has decided to create a National Database of Unorganized Workers (NDUW) and e-Shram Portal has been launched on 26.08.2021 for registration of unorganized workers. These workers are engaged in various fields such as agriculture, industry, services.
Unorganized workers' organizations working in various professions in the unorganized sector of the state as well as the people's representatives of the state have been constantly demanding the formation of welfare boards for the welfare of the workers according to the classification of the business of the unorganized workers. Thus, instead of forming separate welfare boards for unorganized workers engaged in different occupations, it would be appropriate to provide benefits of social security and welfare schemes to all unorganized workers by forming a comprehensive single corporation. Accordingly, the matter of forming a welfare corporation for the unorganized workers in the state was under the consideration of the government.
Government decision: As per the decision taken in the cabinet meeting on 28th June 2023, the government is approving the establishment of 39 virtual boards under the Maharashtra State Unorganized Workers Welfare Corporation and its affiliated industries/ business sectors in Schedule-I for providing social security and various welfare schemes to the economically weaker sections of the unorganized workers in the state. Detailed provisions in respect of Maharashtra State Unorganized Workers Welfare Corporation and 39 Virtual Boards will be laid down under the Act and Rules.
