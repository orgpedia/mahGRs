Date is December 4, 2018
Reference:- State Election Commission, Maharashtra No. RANIA/ NAPA-2018/ Q. No.17/ K.6, D. The letter was dated November 28, 2018.
As per Article 243 K and 243ZA of the Constitution of India, the State Election Commission is responsible for conducting elections to all local bodies (Municipal Corporations, Municipal Councils/ Municipalities, Zilla Parishads, Panchayat Samitis and Gram Panchayats) in a free, fair and transparent manner.
Our country has adopted a democratic system and all registered people above the age of 18 are expected to vote 100 per cent in every election. In view of this, on the day of poll, the electors are usually given a paid holiday or in some cases a reasonable relaxation in working hours to enable them to exercise their franchise. However, in the last few elections, it has been observed that institutions/ establishments etc. do not provide paid holidays or concessions. As a result, many voters are being disenfranchised. This is very dangerous for democracy.
3.According to the order issued by the State Election Commission. General elections to the Municipal Corporations and Municipal Councils/ Nagar Panchayats as mentioned in Annexure-I will be held on 9th December, 2018. In order to enable all the electors to exercise their right to vote in these elections, it is hereby ordered as under: 1) Workers/ officers/ employees who are electors in the polling area where the election is to be held, shall be given additional leave to exercise their right to vote on the day of election, even if they are working outside the area where the election is to be held.
(ii) This holiday will be applicable to all establishments, factories, shops etc. under the Department of Industries, Energy and Labour (e.g. Establishments of the State Government, Central Government and private companies, all shops and other establishments, residential hotels, eateries, other houses, theatres, trade, industrial undertakings or other establishments as well as information and technology companies, shopping centres, malls, retailers, etc. However, the Municipal Commissioner or the District Collector concerned has been informed about it.
