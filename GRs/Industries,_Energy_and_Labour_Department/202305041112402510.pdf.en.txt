Our country has adopted a democratic system and all registered citizens above the age of 18 are expected to cast 100 per cent votes in every election. In view of this, Rule 135 (b) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 (Part-II) provides that on the day of poll, the electors are generally given a paid holiday or, in some cases, a reasonable relaxation in working hours to enable them to exercise their franchise. However, in the last few elections, it has been observed that institutions/ establishments etc.
There are no holidays or holidays. This deprives many voters of their right to vote, which is very dangerous for democracy.
As per the order issued by the Election Commission of India, elections to the Karnataka Legislative Assembly will be held on May 10, 2023. In this election, the voters of Karnataka state who are working in the bordering districts of Maharashtra (Sindhudurg, Kolhapur, Sangli, Solapur, Osmanabad, Latur and Nanded districts), however, their names are included in the electoral rolls of Karnataka state, to exercise their right to vote, are being ordered as follows: Workers/ officers/ employees who are voters in the polling area where the election is to be held, shall be given leave to exercise their franchise on the day of election even if they are working outside the area where the election is to be held for the purpose of work.
(ii) This holiday will be applicable to all establishments, factories, shops etc. under the Department of Industries, Energy and Labour (e.g. Private companies, establishments, all shops and other establishments, residential hotels, eateries, other houses, theatres, trade, industrial enterprises or other establishments as well as information and technology companies, shopping centres, malls, retailers, etc.
