3. Decentralized Micro Grid Projects:
Eligibility Criteria:
Villages/ villages in remote areas which are not electrified by conventional means.
The MSEDCL should submit a list of villages in the most remote areas of the state that cannot be electrified through the traditional method to the Maha Urja by the end of February every year.
As per the list, MahaUrja will conduct a survey of these villages and submit a detailed project report. As per the survey, the final list of villages/ wadis/ padis will be finalised by MAHAYURJ by the end of April every year. In this, when choosing a village, the houses in the village will have to be in a cluster.
The project report will contain detailed information about the number of houses available in the village and the electricity charge required for them. With this, the capacity of the non-transmission solar plant to be installed in the village will be determined. Such villages will have to be provided land by the respective Gram Panchayat for setting up the project.
It will propose the capacity of non-transmission solar plants based on the number of households for the respective work and the capacity of household electrical appliances required. The plant will be installed on the available land in the village and a control room will be built. It will contain power drawer, charge controller for the plant, energy meter for generation site and consumption site, switch for switching on/ off the plant, etc. From this control room, electricity poles (like solar street lights) will be installed in the entire village. Electricity connections will be provided to all households. Electrical appliances will be installed as needed. A village energy security committee will be set up.
After the plant is installed, the responsibility of its maintenance, repair during the maintenance and repair period will be of the concerned manufacturer. But the day-to-day maintenance and repair will be done by the Village Energy Safety Committee. After the maintenance and repair period is over, it will be mandatory for the concerned Village Energy Safety Committee to enter into a contract for the maintenance repair required for the same from the manufacturer or from the manufacturer suitable to him or herself.
