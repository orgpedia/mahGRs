Introduction: Industries should come up in Vidarbha, Marathwada, North Maharashtra, D and D+ areas and in view of the industrial, social and economic prosperity of this region, the Government of Maharashtra has decided to set up an Industrial Development Corporation. With effect from 01.04.2016, the Government is providing rebate in power tariff to eligible industrial consumers in the sector as per the provisions of the relevant Government Decisions 2 to 7. This concession is given on the basis of (i) fuel adjustment size, (ii) industry efficiency, and (iii) additional per unit discount on the increased power consumption if the newly established and operating industry expands. Concessions based on the performance of the industry are being given per unit in ascending order in four stages from 0-5% to 15-20% in proportion to the extent to which the eligible industry component avails the concessions (currently up to 18%) fixed by the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission in its electricity tariff order. Therefore, it has been observed that certain industrial units with high power consumption (Continuous Process Industries) are more likely to benefit from this concession. Hence, the present Rs. The annual limit of Rs 1200 crore expires in 9-10 months, which means that other industries in this sector, especially MSMEs, do not get its benefit for a full year. Representations in this regard have been received from people's representatives, electricity consumers associations, industrial associations and industry bodies. In this regard, the government has decided to form a study group to study and rationalize the existing concessions and make suitable recommendations to the government. Under Section 8, a Study Group was constituted under the Chairmanship of Chairman and Managing Director, MSEDCL. The study group held discussions with various industrial consumers associations, prominent social organizations in Vidarbha, Marathwada, North Maharashtra, D& D+ areas and other geographical areas and studied the issues raised by them during the discussions and submitted a report to the Department of Energy.
