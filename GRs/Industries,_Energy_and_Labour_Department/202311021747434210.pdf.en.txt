Our country has adopted a democratic system and all registered citizens above the age of 18 are expected to vote in every election. In view of this, Section 135 (b) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 provides for grant of paid holiday or relaxation in working hours on the day of poll to enable the electors to exercise their franchise. However, in the last few elections, it has been observed that institutions/ establishments etc. do not provide paid holidays or concessions. So many voters have to be deprived of their vote, which is very dangerous for democracy.
The Election Commission of India (ECI) has announced the schedule for the 2023 General Elections to the Legislative Assemblies of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Telangana. The elections will be held on Tuesday, November 7, 2023 and Friday, November 17, 2023 in the state of Chhattisgarh; Friday, November 17, 2023 in the state of Madhya Pradesh and Thursday, November 30, 2023 in the state of Telangana. The districts bordering Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Telangana are given in the table below.
