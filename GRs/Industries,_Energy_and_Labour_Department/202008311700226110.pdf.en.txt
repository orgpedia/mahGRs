Introduction: Maharashtra is the most industrialized state in India. of the population
Maharashtra is the second largest state in India in terms of area. Maharashtra is a biodiverse state suitable for agricultural development due to its agro-climatic zones and varied land types. Agriculture and allied sectors contribute 12.5 per cent to the state's GDP. Agriculture is the mainstay of the state's economy. There is a favourable situation for the food processing industry in the state due to the abundance of processable raw materials. Increasing urbanization and rising incomes are the key developers of the retail industry in the state. The growth of the economy, changes in food habits, improved living standards due to increase in income and the trend of double income in families and rapid urbanization in a progressive state like Maharashtra have a huge scope for development in the food processing sector.
In the last 5 years, a total of 41 large and large agricultural and food processing units have been established in the state. 3500 crore investment and about 10,000 jobs have been created. With these factors, the investment limit for MSMEs under the Industrial Policy-2019 to promote agro and food processing industries has been increased from Rs. 10 crore to Rs. 50 crore. Also, the incentives to MSMEs are permissible at 100% GST rate, which will benefit the industry in a big way. Under this policy, the state government has decided to set up mini food parks with all infrastructure facilities on 10 acres in all the districts and give special financial incentives to the units to be set up in them. Financial incentives of 20% plus for existing agro and food processing industries and additional incentives for two years.
This period is paid by the Collective Incentive Scheme 2019. Since the Goods and Services Tax (GST) rates on these agricultural and food products are low, these units enjoy very low incentives (30 to 40 per cent) during the incentive period.
