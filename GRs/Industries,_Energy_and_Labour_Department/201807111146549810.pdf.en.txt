Action to be taken regarding the restoration of roads under the Public Works Department for the work of underground power lines in urban areas.
The Government of Maharashtra
Department of Industry, Energy and Labour
Government Resolution No: R.P.D.-2018/ P.No.124/ Energy-5
Camp Office, Nagpur
The date: July 11, 2018.
The Proposal:
The Maharashtra government has directed all municipal corporations/ municipalities/ nagar parishads in the state to implement the memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed by the MSEDCL with the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) to" reduce the RJ charges levied by the local bodies for laying underground ducts in urban areas." The Chief Minister gave this information in the review meeting of the Power Department held on 24.08.2017.
Roads in some parts of the state are under the Public Works Department and the offices under them were required to implement the instructions. It has been observed that in some areas, the cost of road restoration under the Public Works Department is more than the cost of underground channels. As a result, the work on the underground channel under the Centrally Sponsored Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS) implemented by MSEDCL has come to a standstill. As the scheme is centrally sponsored and time-bound, the Public Works Department has given the approval to all the departments under its control. The matter of giving instructions to take action as per the above directions given by the Chief Minister was under consideration of the Government. Following this, the government took decision:
GOVERNMENT DECISION:- The Government approves the Memorandum of Understanding between the concerned Chief Engineer of the Public Works Department and the concerned Chief Engineer/ Superintending Engineer of the MSEDCL on the rates to be charged for the work of underground power lines in the urban areas of the State, subject to the following conditions as per the MoU signed by the MSEDCL with the Nagpur Municipal Corporation.
(a) The MSEDCL shall obtain the approval of the Chief Engineer concerned of the Public Works Department for the arrangement of work for laying underground power lines.
(b) The entire work shall be carried out by MSEDCL but shall be supervised by the Public Works Department.

(c) Once the road restoration work is completed, it should be certified by the Public Works Department.
(2) In case the roads are not restored after laying of underground power lines by MSEDCL as per the said MoU, the said cost shall be adjusted against the amount of power dues received by MSEDCL from the Public Works Department.
