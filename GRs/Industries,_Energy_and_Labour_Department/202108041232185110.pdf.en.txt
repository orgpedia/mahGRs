Preamble: The State Government has notified the" Maharashtra Electronics Policy-2016 and Incentives for FAB Projects under it" Policy vide Government Decision No. MoDHO-2014/ PR No.118/ INDUSTRY-2 dated 11th April, 2016 has been notified. The incentives offered under the Maharashtra Electronics Policy-2016 were linked to the M-SIPS scheme to ensure that the entity applying under the Maharashtra Electronics Policy is an electronics manufacturing entity. Since the M-SIPS is a central government scheme that examines in depth whether a component is an electronics manufacturing unit, it was decided to provide incentives under the state's electronic policy, taking into account the eligibility criteria. However, the central government's M-SIPS scheme has come to an end from January, 2019.
In view of the above, the State Electronics Policy-2016 is being amended to de-link the State Electronics Policy-2016 from the Central Government's M-SIPS Scheme and align the electronic components included in these schemes with the Central Government's SPECS and PLI schemes.
Incentives to be allowed under the policy, as well as the existing Electronics Policy-2016 of the State. As on 31/03/2023 vide Reference No. The deadline has been extended as per the government's 19th decision. as well
