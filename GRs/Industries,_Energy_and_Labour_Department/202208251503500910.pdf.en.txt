In order to further strengthen the power distribution sector, the Central Government in 2014 launched the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY) to empower the power infrastructure in rural areas of the State and the Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS) to empower the power infrastructure in urban areas. Through these two schemes, the distribution system of MSEDCL in the state was strengthened. Both of these projects are currently underway. Apart from this, un-electrified households have been electrified through the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Saubhagya (Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana). Since October 2017. During 31.03.2019, 15,17,922 households in the State have been provided electricity connections through grid connectivity and 30,538 households through solar energy.
It has come to the notice of the Central Government that even after implementation of the above Centrally Sponsored Power Infrastructure Schemes, the gap between Aggregate Technical& Commercial (AT& C) losses and Average Cost of Supply minus Average Revenue Realized (ACS minus ARR) is high. For this, it has been pointed out that the distribution companies need to focus on improving their operational efficiency and financial sustainability. Customer service is as per customer standards. In order to achieve this, keeping in view the commitment to provide uninterrupted, quality, reliable and affordable power supply to the consumers, the Central Government has announced a time bound programme of" Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme Reforms Based and Results-Linked Scheme" (RDSS) with a view to substantially improve the existing distribution system and implement schemes which will reduce the distribution losses as well as make the distribution companies financially viable and improve the operational efficiency.
Power Finance Corporation (PFC) has been appointed as the nodal agency for Maharashtra.

The central government has approved this scheme. The same has been notified vide Office Memorandum dated 20.07.2021.
After that. 18.11.2021 and dt. The revised guidelines have been issued vide letter dated 03.01.2022. In which the infrastructure works in disaster-prone areas were included in the DPR. Accordingly, the Company has paid Rs. 39,602 crore and Best Initiatives at Rs. The Detailed Project Report and Action Plan amounting to Rs. 3460.98 crore have been submitted to the Central Government for its approval.
The salient features of the Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme Reforms-Based and Results-Linked (RDSS) Scheme are as follows:
Objectives of the scheme: To improve the supply of electricity to consumers from a financially stable and efficient distribution system to ensure uninterrupted, quality, reliable and affordable power supply.
Reduce Aggregate Technical and Commercial Loss (AT& C) to 12-15% by 2024-25.
Average Cost of Supply minus Annual Revenue Realized (ACS) Gap to be brought down to zero by 2024-25.
Components of the plan: Part (a):
Component (1)- Metering: Installation of Prepaid/ Smart Meters for consumers (excluding Agri Pump consumers).
Installation of Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) compatible meters to feeders and distribution lines.
Component (2):- Works related to distribution infrastructure:
1) Works under the reduction of distribution losses:
1. channel separation.
2. Aerial Bunch Cable
3.High pressure/ low pressure channel upgradation
4. change of conductor.

(3) Project Management: The qualifying distribution company may appoint a Project Management Agency to carry out all the necessary works in respect of the said scheme.
Part (b): Training, capacity building and other enabling and supporting functions. Training, Capacity Building and Other Enabling& Supporting Activities (3) Fund Management under RDSS Scheme: 60% of the cost of power infrastructure projects will be subsidized by the Central Government to the distribution companies. The distribution will be based on the supply of the specified quantity. The remaining amount will be provided by the distribution companies through loans.
Further, Rs. The distribution companies will get a subsidy of Rs 900 from the central government. The remaining amount will be provided by the distribution companies through Totex mode.
(iv) Sunset Date: The closing date of the scheme is 31.03.2026. After this date, the central government will not provide any subsidy for the work done.
