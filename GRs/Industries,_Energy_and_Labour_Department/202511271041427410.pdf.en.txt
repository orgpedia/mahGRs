Preamble: The State's IT and IT-enabled GAT Policy-2023 has been announced under the Government Decision dated 27.06.2023. Through this policy, the key objectives are to establish the state of Maharashtra as the technology capital of the country and to achieve inclusive development based on innovation and sustainable technology. To achieve the goals set out in this policy, special emphasis has been laid on the development of AVGC and other emerging technology areas such as AI, AI (AD, Internet of Things (01), Block Chain, Robotics, Automation, Quantum Computing, Virtual Reality, Enhanced AKT (Extended Reality), Big Data, Machine Learning, Cyber Security, etc.
The development of these emerging technology sectors is critical to achieving the state's ambitious goal of a $1 trillion economy. In advanced countries, nutrient ecosystems exist for industries based on the latest technologies. Maharashtra needs to create a positive and enabling ecosystem for these sectors to attract more investment and technology to a competitive global market. A network of high-quality incubation HATA (Incubation Centres) needs to be set up in the state to provide comprehensive support to startups in emerging technology sectors. Such facilities will enable startups and MSME industry units in the state to remain globally competitive to meet the challenges of the future.
For the purpose of promoting startups and innovation as enshrined in the Mixed Business Permit Guidelines in the IT / ITeS Policy-2023 4. 3.3.

As per the earlier policy, it has been mandated to reserve at least 2% of the total construction area in all approved IT parks for providing SARIS facilities to new entities / startups. Accordingly, a total of 1,38,766 sqm of construction area is currently available for incubation through a total registered and under-construction IT park.
Against this backdrop, the government was considering implementing TRE (MATRIX: Maharashtra Technology, Research Incubator and Accelerator), an initiative based on the "not-for-profit-no-TET" principle to promote startups, innovation and technology development in emerging technology sectors.
Government Decisions: Matrix for promoting Startups, Innovation and Technology in Emerging Technologies as provided in the IT & ITeS Policy-2023
The initiative (MATRIX: Maharashtra Technology, Research Incubator and Accelerator) is being approved on a "not-for-profit-no-loss" basis.
Objectives: 1) To create a network of at least 200 incubation centres in the state to promote start-up components, innovation and technology in the emerging technology sector and to make available an area of about 15 lakh sq ft for SARI facility under this.
2) Benefit at least 10,000 startup entities in the emerging technology sector over a period of 5 years after the ART initiative becomes operational.
3) Through successful start-up entities, Rs. To attract 1 lakh crore investments and create 1 lakh new jobs based on high technology.
4) In tier 2 and tier 3 cities especially Hal qa (AgriTech), Health AAA (HealthTech), Economic Technology (. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ Development of these sectors by empowering green technology ((11'80 |)) startups.
5) Empowerment of SC, ST and Women Startup units on priority.
Under the Matrix initiative, collaboration with reputed national and international institutions will enable start-up entities in the emerging technology sector, especially SC / ST and women-led industries, to become internationally competitive by providing high-quality infrastructure and SARITA.
Part nodes: d. Construction areas (at least 2% of total built-up area) reserved for providing incubation facilities to new entities / startups in IT parks approved as per the Government Decision of 18.05.2016 will be used under Hela 1) Incubation nodes under the matrix will be based on the next 4 models structure-wise i. Hub and Spoke Model: Under this framework, nodes of a sub-region will be established elsewhere in the state by establishing a hub of that sub-region at a location that is critical to a particular sub-region in the emerging technology sector. The proposed nodes will operate under the guidance of the main hub.
ii, Collaborative Model: Under this framework, more than one SARS centre works with a common goal and joint leadership. The SARIS centres involved in this framework work with resource sharing and inter-partnership.

IRA Decision Number: Matundo-2025 / Q. No. 187 / Industry-2
C. Cluster Model: Under this model, a large incubation organization operates incubation centres at more than one location. These incubation centres may be based on more than one technology. All these centres are controlled by a single agency.
iv. Standalone Incubation Node: SARIS centres operating independently.
2) The incubation nodes under the matrix will be classified by region mainly as follows.
