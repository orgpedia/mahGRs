Government's decision:
The Covid-19 pandemic has impacted the entire world, including the power sector. The average daily demand of electricity in Maharashtra has come down from 23000 MW to 16000 MW, as a result of which the availability of adequate electricity, maintaining quality and action to be taken in accordance with the main scheme of electricity for all, the concessions given by the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission to industrial and commercial consumers, as well as the concessions from the government, will lead to financial problems for the companies like Mahanirmiti, Mahatrans and MSEDCL. There will be a financial loss in cash flow, payment of electricity purchase, monthly expenses, etc. In view of the possibility of such loans being available at cheaper rates if the loans raised by these companies under various measures are guaranteed by the Government, the Cabinet in its meeting held on 09.06.2020 discussed the proposal to allow Government guarantee for such loans and decided as follows:
The Government of Maharashtra is approving to allow a maximum amount of Rs.20,000 crore (Rs.20,000 crore) as guarantee for various types of contracts to be entered into with NTPC or PFC or REC or nationalized banks or financial institutions for the availability of funds by MSEB, MSEB, Mahatrans and MSEDCL.
2. It is being approved to waive the guarantee fee charged by the Government for this guarantee.
3. The amount of loan to be taken in respect of the said loan and guarantee amount and the terms and conditions of the collateral shall be determined by the High Powered Committee headed by the Chief Secretary. The composition of the committee will be as follows:
(9) Ma. the Chief Secretary
Additional Chief Secretary (Finance) Member
