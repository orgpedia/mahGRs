Introduction: As per the Maharashtra Industrial Policy-2013, a special abhaya scheme was being implemented to provide easy exit options to non-renewable and closed industrial units with a view to utilising their land-locked fixed assets. The Special Abhaya Scheme was implemented till 31st March, 2017. Issue No. 14.1 of the Maharashtra Industrial Policy, 2019 includes a special abhaya scheme. Considering the difficulties faced in implementing the" Special Abhaya Yojana" and to ensure that more and more industry units get the benefit of this scheme, the matter of implementing the" Special Abhaya Yojana" in a modified form was under consideration of the government.

Government's decision:
In case of default in payment of Government dues to non-resilient and closed units, the transfer of immovable property of that unit to another unit is being approved through a special Abhaya Scheme by waiving off the interest and penalty on the principal amount paid by the unit. The scheme will be in force for the period of Maharashtra New Industrial Policy-2019.
The benefit of this scheme will be given to the industrial units fulfilling the following criteria.
(a) An enterprise unit which has been closed for more than one year or declared insolvent by a court.
(b) Non-renewable industry component as per Reserve Bank of India guidelines.
c) The transfer of the enterprise component will result in a change in the management of the component and the component will continue to operate successfully.
The following instructions are to be followed while giving the benefit of Special Abhaya Scheme to the industry unit meeting the above criteria.
A certificate from the concerned financial institution regarding the closure/ non-resurgence of the unit or a certificate from the Chartered Accountant regarding the sickness of the unit as per the definition of sick industry by the Reserve Bank of India shall be taken.
(2) While ascertaining that the unit has been shut down, any evidence of the unit's electricity dues for the relevant period, water dues, documents regarding power/ water supply outages, annual balance sheet from the financial year of the shutdown of production, shall be taken into account and the unit shall be required to submit an affidavit regarding the date of shutdown.
3) A change in the previous management is expected after the unit is given the benefit of the special abhaya scheme. a) Change in the controlling stake in the share capital of the company.

4) The new entity will be required to make a minimum fixed capital investment equivalent to the fixed assets of the previous entity (including the principal value of land and depreciation value of land). The investment will have to be made within three years from the date of implementation of the scheme. The investment should not be in the form of repayment of loan.
5) The Department concerned has to take a decision on providing the benefit of the Special Abhaya Scheme to the non-renewable/ closed industrial units in respect of which claims are pending before the Court/ Authority.
If the units closed before and after April 1, 2010 and transferred to the new management fulfill all the conditions of the decision of the government, then such closed units will be given the benefit of the Special Abhaya Scheme if the original amount due to the government is paid in two installments in the first two years after the approval of the Special Abhaya Scheme.
If the recovery proceedings are being carried out by any department of the government on the industrial units that were closed and transferred before April 1, 2019, but have not gone into production, then such units will be given benefits under the Special Abhaya Scheme if they pay the principal amount of government dues in one lump sum.
8) The benefit of this scheme is only for the payment of government dues. Corporations under the government, which have given loans from their own funds for the construction of manufacturing units, should recover the repayment of outstanding loans. For this, the assets of the concerned industry unit should be restructured.
In cases where the information regarding the amount of Government subsidy/ incentive actually enjoyed by the units under the collective incentive scheme 1988 or earlier is not available with the unit/ concerned implementing office, the unit shall be deemed to have enjoyed 100% sales tax on the capital investment sanctioned by the qualifying certificate issued to the unit. Also, in cases where the eligibility certificate, documents etc. are not found, the benefits of the Special Abhaya Scheme should be given by considering the incentives/ grants enjoyed by the unit so far as the total sanctioned grant. Sales tax incentives, special capital grants, etc.)

10) The new management is expected to start the production unit within three years at the same location. Also, the entrepreneur will be able to make changes in the product with a view to ensuring that the industry unit continues to do well in the future. service industry (e.g. IT/ BT/ Theme Park, etc.) can also be started, which will create employment and investment by proper use of that land.
11) The units which have been transferred without any encumbrances under the SARFESI Act, DRT, High Court Liquidator as well as the orders of NCLT/ NCALT.

In the case of claims pending before the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), various departments of the State Government have not reported their dues to the NCLT within the prescribed time frame. Therefore, a separate mechanism will be put in place between the Department of Industries and the Directorate General of Industries to deal with NCLT cases. Necessary steps will be taken to repay the outstanding dues of the state in coordination with NCLT and industry through this independent mechanism.
The implementation of the Special Abhaya Scheme will be done by the office of the Development Commissioner (Industries), Directorate of Industries, under the Department of Industries. Whether the unit is started at the concerned place after the approval of the special abhaya scheme is to be controlled by the Directorate of Industries or the officer authorized by them.
13) The information about the industrial units which have been benefited by various departments under the Special Abhaya Scheme, the amount of benefit/ exemption should be given by that department to the Directorate of Industries or the officer authorized by it.
The details of the government grants of these industries will be displayed on the online website of the Directorate of Industries.
The new management availing the benefit of the Special Abhaya Scheme shall be required to commence production at the site within three years from the date of sanction of the Special Abhaya Scheme.
Failing to do so, the benefits sanctioned under the Special Abhaya Scheme will be recovered with an interest of 12% per annum. A tripartite agreement in this regard will be signed as per the pattern prescribed by the Directorate General of Industries.
