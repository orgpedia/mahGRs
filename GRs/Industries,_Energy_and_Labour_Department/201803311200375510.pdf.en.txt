Reference:- State Election Commission, Maharashtra No. Rania/ NAPA-2018/ P. No. 07/ K. 6, Dy. The letter dated March 22, 2018.
As per Article 243 K and 243ZA of the Constitution of India, the State Election Commission is responsible for conducting elections to all local bodies (Municipal Corporations, Municipal Councils/ Municipalities, Zilla Parishads, Panchayat Samitis and Gram Panchayats) in a free, fair and transparent manner.
Our country has adopted a democratic system and all registered people above the age of 18 are expected to vote 100 per cent in every election. In view of this, on the day of poll, the electors are usually given a paid holiday or in some cases a reasonable relaxation in working hours to enable them to exercise their franchise. However, in the last few elections, it has been observed that institutions/ establishments etc. do not provide paid holidays or concessions. As a result, many voters are being disenfranchised. This is very dangerous for democracy.
3.According to the order issued by the State Election Commission. General/ bye-elections will be held on 6th April, 2018 as mentioned in Annexure-I and Annexure-II. In order to enable all the electors to exercise their right to vote in these elections, it is hereby ordered as under: 1) Workers/ officers/ employees who are electors in the polling area where the election is to be held, shall be given additional leave to exercise their right to vote on the day of election, even if they are working outside the area where the election is to be held.
(ii) This holiday will be applicable to all establishments, factories, shops etc. under the Department of Industries, Energy and Labour (e.g. Private companies, establishments, all shops and other establishments, residential hotels, eateries, other houses, theatres, trade, industrial enterprises or other establishments as well as information and technology companies, shopping centres, malls, retailers, etc.

In any case, the concerned establishment owners will have to ensure that voters get at least two to three hours of relaxation for voting.
(iv) The owners/ management of all establishments, factories, shops etc. under the Industries, Energy and Labour Department as mentioned above shall ensure strict compliance of the aforesaid instructions. If voters complain that they are not able to cast their votes due to lack of proper leave or concession for voting, appropriate action will be taken against them.
