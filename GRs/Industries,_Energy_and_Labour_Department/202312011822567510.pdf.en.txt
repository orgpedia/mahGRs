Introduction: Considering the increase in demand for electricity due to the rapid industrialization and infrastructure development in the state of Maharashtra, the company has developed a coal-based super critical technology based in Mauje Koradi, Ta. A proposal for setting up a 2x660 MW power plant at Kamti, G.Nagpur has been submitted to the Government. The old No. 5 (200 MW), Nashik Sets No. 4 (210 MW), Nashik Sets No. 5 (210 MW), Parali Set No. 4 (210 MW), Parali Sets No. 5 (210 MW) and Chandrapur Set No. 3 (210 MW) for a total capacity of 1250 MW, 2x660 MW (1320 MW) based on coal based and super critical technology at Koradi Thermal Power Station. A power generation plant of watt capacity has been proposed.
Construction of the project. The Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission has also given in-principle approval on certain terms and conditions.
Considering the projected demand for electricity between 2020 and 2030, as projected by the 19th Electrical Power Survey and Power for All, MSEDCL's demand for electricity in 2029-30 is estimated to be 34729 MW. up to watt

It is likely to go. Considering this demand and the availability of renewable energy at present, the limitations on the storage system, thermal energy will be required for peak load. The Central Government has also advised the power generation companies to continue the construction of the projects that have been put on hold or are in the process of getting their approval. In view of this policy, the state government also needs to take steps in view of the future demand for electricity.
In the year 2019, it has also been 5 years since the state government's policy of not producing thermal energy. Meeting the future demand for electricity is also very important for the development of the state. Considering the need to align the policy of the State Government with the policy of the Central Government, setting up of thermal power generation plants has become a necessity in view of the future power demand. Considering this, it is also necessary to take steps to meet the future power demand.
In the background above, the proposed 2x660 m. The revised environmental norms, including FGD and SCR, for the Watt Koradi project is estimated to cost Rs. 10,625 crore. The state government was supposed to bear 20% of the cost. As a result, the following decisions were taken:
