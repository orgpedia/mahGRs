The Proposal:
Various Mathadi Mandals have been set up in the State under the Maharashtra Mathadi Hamal and Other Labourers (Regulation of Employment and Welfare) Act, 1969. Section 2 of the Act defines the definition of contractor, principal employer, establishment and worker. Section 4 of the said Act lays down the scheme of the Boards for implementation of the Act and Section 7 lays down the duties and functions of the Boards.
In the schemes framed under the Mathadi Act, the boards are empowered and bound to collect the levy as well as the dues involved in the scheme. The provisions of the scheme include levy, wages, etc. payable on the principal employers for the work done by the workers registered with the Board.
It is obligatory to give. As per the provisions of the scheme, Mathadi workers are registered as Mathadi workers but are not employees of the Board. Therefore, as per the definition of" worker,"" employer and principal employer" in the Maharashtra Mathadi Hamal and Other Working Workers (Regulation of Employment and Welfare) Act, 1969, Mathadi Mandals do not fall within the definition of" employer or principal employer."
Since Mathadi Mandals do not fall under the category of employers and since there is no provision for deduction of loan or loan instalment from the salary of Mathadi workers in the existing schemes of Mathadi Mandals under the Maharashtra Mathadi Hamal and Other Working Workers (Regulation of Employment and Welfare) Act, 1969, the Department of Law and Justice has received the views of the Government as to whether or not such Mathadi Mandals can deduct the loan or loan instalment taken by Mathadi workers through financial institutions like co-operative societies/ credit banks/ nationalised banks from the salary of Mathadi workers in the records. The comments made by the Department of Law and Justice are as follows:
"As regards the deductions of loan amount all installment or of loan amount from the wages
of the registered workers taken by them from Co-operative society or Nationalized Bank, the Board
has no authority to deduct the installment of such a loan and pay to the Bank, as the Board is not
the employer/principle employers of the registered workers under the Scheme."

In view of the feedback given by the Department of Law and Justice and the provisions in the schemes of various Mathadi Boards framed under the Maharashtra Mathadi Hamal and Other Working Workers (Regulation of Employment and Welfare) Act, 1969, the following decisions are being taken regarding the deduction from the salary of Mathadi workers on record.
Government's decision:
According to the definition of" worker,"" employer" and" principal employer" in the Maharashtra Mathadi Hamal and Other Working Workers (Regulation of Employment and Welfare) Act, 1969, Mathadi Mandals do not fall within the definition of" employer" or" principal employer." Further, since there is no provision for deduction of the amount of loan or instalment of loan etc. taken by the registered Mathadi workers from the Cooperative Credit Banks, Cooperative Societies or Cooperative Banks and Nationalized Banks, the existing schemes for implementation of the Act for various Mathadi Mandals under the said Act also do not provide for deduction of the amount of loan or instalment of loan etc. taken by the registered Mathadi workers from the wages of Mathadi workers.
