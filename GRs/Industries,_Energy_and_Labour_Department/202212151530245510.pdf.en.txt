Date: 15th of December 2022.
Reference:- State Election Commission, Maharashtra No. Rania/ Gram Panchayats-2022/ No. 8/ Ka-8, Dy. The letter is dated December 14, 2022.
Our country has adopted a democratic system and all registered citizens above the age of 18 are expected to cast 100 per cent votes in every election. In view of this, Rule 135 (b) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 (Part-II) provides that on the day of poll, the electors are generally given a paid holiday or, in some cases, a reasonable relaxation in working hours to enable them to exercise their franchise. However, in the last few elections, it has been observed that institutions/ establishments etc. do not provide paid holidays or concessions. This deprives many voters of their right to vote, which is very dangerous for democracy.
(2) As per the orders issued by the State Election Commission in terms of the letters under reference. Gram Panchayat General Election is scheduled to be held on 18/12/2022 as mentioned in Annexure-I. In order to ensure that all voters are able to exercise their right to vote in this election, the following orders are being issued:
. Workers/ officers/ employees who are voters in the polling area where the election is to be held, shall be given leave to exercise their franchise on the day of election, even if they are working outside the area where the election is to be held.
(ii) This holiday will be applicable to all establishments, factories, shops etc. under the Department of Industries, Energy and Labour (e.g. (iii) In exceptional circumstances, where it is not possible to grant full day leave to workers, officers, employees etc., workers in the polling area may be given a relaxation of at least two hours in lieu of leave to exercise their franchise. However, prior permission of the District Collector and the District Election Officer will be required for the same. In any case, the owners of the establishment concerned will have to ensure that the voters get at least two hours of relaxation for voting.
(iv) that the above instructions shall be duly complied with by the owners/ management of all establishments, factories, shops etc., falling under the Department of Industries, Power and Labour as mentioned above.
