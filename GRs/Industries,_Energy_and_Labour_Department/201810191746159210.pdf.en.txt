Government Resolution No. Asanka 2018/ Q. No.14/ Work.7A
Hutatma Rajguru Chowk, Madam Cama Marg,
Ministry, Mumbai 400 032.
The date is October 19, 2018.
The Proposal:
Sugar industry is one of the major industries in the state of Maharashtra and at present, there are about 8 lakh sugarcane workers employed in about 101 cooperative sector and 87 private sector sugar mills operating in the state.
Most of the sugarcane workers are from the Marathwada region, especially Beed district, and have migrated to different districts of the state.
The Maharashtra State Cooperative Sugar Factories Federation Ltd. It is operated by Mumbai and sugar factories. Accident insurance, insurance for huts and bullock carts are provided to sugarcane workers by sugar mills. In case of serious injury to the sugarcane plucking farm laborers, free ambulance arrangement and hospitalization expenses are borne by the factory. Similarly, free disease diagnosis camps are organized during the season for medical services and health at low cost. Although sugarcane crushing workers are given approval and other benefits as per the MoU at the level of Maharashtra State Sugar Mills Union, sugarcane workers do not get the benefits of social security schemes such as Provident Fund, Workers State Insurance Scheme, Gratuity, Compensation, Anugrah Grant, etc. Their children and families do not get the benefit of any social schemes. Since the life of these sugarcane workers and their families was unstable and very difficult, the government was considering bringing the unprotected sugarcane workers in the sugarcane cutting business under the purview of the law and giving them the benefit of various welfare schemes to make their life comfortable, raise their living standards and make their life stable and safe.
in this regard dated 10.12.2017. The Cabinet decided to provide social security to sugarcane workers and their families as it would be impractical to provide benefits of schemes under the Maharashtra Matadi Hamal and Shramjeevi Karmachari (Regulation of Employment and Welfare) Act, 1969 to sugarcane workers.
