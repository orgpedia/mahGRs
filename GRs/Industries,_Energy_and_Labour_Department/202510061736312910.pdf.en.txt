Government Decision Number: Sink 2025 / Q. No.35 / Energy-7
Madame Cama Road, Hutatma Rajguru Chowk, Mantralaya, Mumbai-400 032.
Date: October 6, 2025.
Reference: - MSEC Letter No. / 02986, D. 30.01.2025
The Proposal: -
With the increasing industrialization and urbanization of the state, the demand for conventional electricity is increasing day by day.
It's growing. The power generation is mainly from coal, fossil fuels, natural gas, and other energy sources.
It comes from resources. These energy resources are limited and will run out in the future.
The indiscriminate use of such energy sources is contributing significantly to air pollution. This is due to the global
The Savans are suffering the undesirable effects of temperature rise and environmental change. at Glasgow.
At the COP26 summit, India has set a target of 500 GW of renewable energy generation.
It also aims to generate 50% of its energy from non-conventional sources by 2030.
Reducing projected carbon emissions by 1 billion tonnes, carbon intensity 45% above 2005 economic levels
India is committed to achieving net zero emissions by 2070.
Commitment is shown.
Electricity consumption and monthly bills for Below Poverty Line or Middle Class citizens.
It is a big expense from the point of view of income. Hence, these consumers have to pay their monthly electricity bills on time.
It has become difficult. For this, increasing the use of non-conventional energy and reducing electricity bills to zero.
It is necessary to achieve the dual objective of reduction. This will result in increased rooftop solar power generation capacity.
Do and provide household electricity to consumers to make them self-sufficient in electricity. On February 29, 2024
Pradhan Mantri Surya Ghar Mukti Bijli Yojana has been approved by the Government of India.
Issued by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), Government of India. 16.03.2024
According to the order of D. To provide free electricity up to 300 units per month from 13.02.2024
A target has been announced to install 1 crore homes with rooftop solar systems. Maharashtra is one of them.
A target has been set for the state to install rooftop solar systems in 8.75 lakh houses.
Solar power of up to 2 kW capacity from the Central Government for installation of solar rooftops at homes
The projects are being subsidized at 60 per cent of the base price with a capacity of 2KW to 3KM. In the midst of
Capacity solar power projects are being subsidised at 40 per cent of the benchmark price.
The subsidy limit is up to 3 kW capacity.

In the case of electricity, if economically weaker power consumers adopt solar power systems, the
The consumer will become self-sufficient and the power generated by the system will be used to generate the remaining power.
They will create an additional source of income. Hence, the economically weaker sections under this initiative.
Rooftop solar to domestic power consumers by providing additional subsidy from the state government.
To encourage setting up of power plants and to increase their participation in activities.
Government proposes to implement "Swayampurna Maharashtra Residential Roof Top (SMART) Solar Scheme"
was under consideration.
The Government's Decisions:
1) Encourage economically weaker power consumers to set up rooftop solar power plants
Making it self-sufficient in electricity as well as the balance after domestic use of energy generated by solar energy.
Creating an additional source of income for them from the sale of existing electricity and thereby rooftop solar.
Self-sufficient Maharashtra Residential Roof Top (SMART) Solar to increase power generation capacity
The scheme is being approved by this government decision.
2) About 1,54,622 household electricity consumers below the poverty line under the scheme as well as their electricity consumption.
The total number of economically weaker household electricity consumers is about 3,45,378, which is less than 100 units.
5,00,000 Central Government to install rooftop solar power system for domestic consumers
In addition to the announced grant, additional grants are being sanctioned to the State Government.
3) For this scheme, the year 2025-26 for this year is Rs. 330 crores and 325 crores for the year 2026-27
Subsidiary to the Maharashtra Electricity Distribution Company under the scheme for provision of such amount.
Approval is being given to open new headings for disbursement of grants.
Objectives of the scheme: -
a) Solar power for below poverty line and economically weaker power consumers.
to be self-sufficient in the case.
b) Income from solar energy to below poverty line and economically weaker power consumers.
Creating additional resources.
c) Increase rooftop solar power generation capacity.
d) To increase local employment opportunities and develop the economy.
Structure of the Scheme: -
Under this scheme, about 1,54,622 household electricity consumers below the poverty line and their consumption
About 3,45,375 for economically weaker domestic power consumers with less than 100 units
Provision of additional grant from the State Government for installation of rooftop solar power systems.
will be done. It encourages consumers to participate in solar energy initiatives.
will be done.

4. Group-wise share of beneficiaries (power consumers) and the fund required: -
State as per base price per kWh for installation of solar power system
The share of the proposed grant from the Government will be as follows: -
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
