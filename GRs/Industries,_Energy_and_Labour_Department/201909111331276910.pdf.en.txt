The Proposal:
In addition to the decision taken regarding the implementation of the Atal Solar Krishi Pump Scheme in the state, the state government has proposed to provide 1 lakh non-transmission solar agricultural pumps to the farmers of the state in three phases. It was approved by the Cabinet at its meeting held on 16th October, 2018. Accordingly, the" Mukhyamantri Solar Krishi Pump Yojana" was implemented in the state as per the decision of the government dated November 15, 2018.
In the first phase of this scheme, the process of installing 25000 Nagas solar agricultural pumps is in progress. In view of the response from the farmers to this scheme and the use of solar pumps by the farmers, the government and MSEDCL, MSEDCL had requested the government to allow the second and third phases of the scheme to be implemented together in the year 2019-20. Considering the urgency and requirement of the farmers, the MSEDCL had requested the government to provide 7.5-horsepower solar agricultural pumps along with 3horsepower and 5horsepower solar agricultural pumps under this scheme and all such solar agricultural pumps should be of DC type. A steering committee has been formed to ensure smooth implementation of the scheme.
Steering Committee The meeting was held on June 12, 2019. After the discussion in the meeting, the committee considered the problems and demands of the farmers regarding the AC type solar agricultural pumps.

Government Resolution No: SOURP-2019/ P.No.159/ Energy-7
It was decided that in addition to the solar agricultural pump, it will be approved to give 7.5 horsepower DC solar agricultural pump (10% of the total number) to the farmers and the MSEDCL should submit a proposal to the government accordingly. Accordingly, the proposal submitted by MSEDCL for installation of 75000 solar agricultural pumps under" Mukhyamantri Solar Krishi Pump Scheme Phase-II& III" was under consideration of the Government.
Government's decision:
In order to enable farmers to irrigate during the day and to achieve the objective of saving the state government's traditional cost of connecting the agricultural pump and the subsidy provided by the state government, the government has approved the implementation of the scheme" Mukhyamantri Solar Krishi Pump Scheme Phase-2 and 3" to install 75,000 solar agricultural pumps in the financial year 2019-20 under the" Mukhyamantri Solar Krishi Pump Scheme" launched for agricultural use to the farmers of the state and the total project cost of Rs. 1531.0705 crore.
" Mukhyamantri Solar Krishi Pump Yojana Phase-2 and 3" will be a fully state government scheme and will be implemented within 18 months from the actual launch of the scheme.
2. Equipment, type-wise determination and category-wise allocation of target:
10% of the pumps will be of 7.5 hp DC capacity. The target of total 75,000 solar agricultural pumps is categorized as 15,000 nos of solar and 7,500 nos of 7.5 HP DC.
Considering the demand for pumps, only solar agricultural pumps of DC type have been included.
The Economic Survey of Maharashtra of the State Government, taking into account the population of Scheduled Castes/ Scheduled Tribes and the general population in 2017-18, the following information is given about the target of 75,000 solar agricultural pumps for the financial year 2019-20, according to the category of beneficiaries and the funds required for it.
