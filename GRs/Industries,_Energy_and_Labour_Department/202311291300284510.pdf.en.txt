The same is annexed herewith as Annexure A (Board wise details of sanctioned posts taken together) and Annexure B-1 to 17 (Board wise details of sanctioned posts taken together).
A total of 166 posts have already been sanctioned in the Private Security Guard Boards, out of which 03 posts are being abolished. A total of 143 new posts have been added. Accordingly, a total of 306 posts are being approved under this government decision.
3. Newly proposed posts of Computer Head, Assistant Computer Head proposed by Security Guard Board, Brihanmumbai and Thane District Boards are being rejected. For this, instead of creating a separate post, temporary staff should be made available as per the requirement through an external source system.

The composition of the said Private Security Guards is being approved subject to the following terms and conditions:
