Election Commission of India, ECI/ PN/ 9/ EPS No. dated January 25, 2023.
Our country has adopted a democratic system and all registered citizens above the age of 18 are expected to vote in every election. In view of this, Section 135 (b) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 provides for grant of paid holiday or relaxation in working hours on the day of poll to enable the electors to exercise their franchise. However, in the last few elections, it has been observed that institutions/ establishments etc. do not provide paid holidays or concessions. So many voters have to be deprived of their vote, which is very dangerous for democracy.
As per the order issued by the Election Commission of India, the two assembly constituencies of Maharashtra- 215-Kasba Peth and 205 Chinchwad- will be represented by the BJP. The by-election will be held on 26/02/2023 (Sunday). In order to ensure that all voters exercise their right to vote in this election, the following orders are being issued:
(i) Workers/ officers/ employees who are electors in the polling area where the election is to be held, even if they are employed outside the area where the election is to be held for the purpose of work, shall be granted leave to exercise their franchise on the day of election.
(ii) This holiday shall be applicable to all groups of industries, corporations, companies and institutions, industrial undertakings or other establishments, etc. under the Department of Industry, Energy and Labour.
(iii) In exceptional circumstances, where it is not possible to grant full day leave to the workers, officers, employees etc., at least two hours may be granted in lieu of leave to the workers in the polling area to exercise their franchise. However, prior permission of the District Collector and the District Election Officer will be required for this. In any case, the concerned establishments will have to ensure that voters get at least two hours of relaxation for voting.
(iv) All corporations, industrial groups, companies and institutions under the Department of Industries, Energy and Labour, etc., shall ensure that the above instructions are strictly complied with. If voters complain that they are not able to cast their votes due to lack of proper leave or concession for voting, appropriate action will be taken against them.
