Our country has adopted a democratic system and all registered people above the age of 18 are expected to cast 100 per cent votes in every election. In view of this, as per Section 135B of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, on the day of poll, the electors are generally given a paid holiday or, in some cases, a reasonable relaxation in working hours to enable them to exercise their franchise. However, in the last few elections, it has been observed that institutions/ establishments etc. do not provide paid holidays or concessions. As a result, many voters are being disenfranchised. This is very dangerous for democracy.
2.According to the order issued by the State Election Commission. General/ bye-elections will be held on 28th May, 2018 as mentioned in Annexure-I. In order to enable all voters to exercise their franchise in these elections, the following orders are being issued: Workers/ officers/ employees who are voters in the polling area where the election is to be held, shall be given leave to exercise their franchise on the day of election even if they are working outside the area where the election is to be held for the purpose of work.
(ii) This holiday will be applicable to all establishments, factories, shops etc. under the Department of Industries, Energy and Labour (e.g. Private companies, establishments, all shops and other establishments, residential hotels, eateries, other houses, theatres, trade, industrial enterprises or other establishments as well as information and technology companies, shopping centres, malls, retailers, etc.
(iii) In exceptional circumstances, where it is not possible to grant full day leave to the workers, officers, employees etc., the workers in the polling area may be given relaxation of only two to three hours in lieu of leave to exercise their franchise. However, they will have to take prior permission from the concerned Municipal Commissioner or Collector. In any case, the concerned establishment owners will have to ensure that voters get at least two to three hours of relaxation for voting.
