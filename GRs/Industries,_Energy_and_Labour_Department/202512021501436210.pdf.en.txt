Introduction: "Bamboo" is an ecologically very useful plant. Bamboo helps in the absorption of carbon dioxide in the air (carbon capture), mitigating climate change, preventing soil erosion, improving soil health, and supporting biodiversity. Economically, the strength and flexibility of bamboo make it suitable for construction, textiles, paper, furniture, handicrafts, composite materials, and energy (jute fuel and bamboo coal). Its cultivation supports rural employment, local economy and economic diversification, upliftment of tribal and tribal areas.
Culturally, bamboo is an integral part of traditional crafts and arts and preserves cultural heritage. Bamboo-based activities empower communities, promote social equity.
Under the National Bamboo Mission (NBM), bamboo plays an important role in the Atmanirbhar Bharat programme, which supports the comprehensive development of the bamboo sector. Through the National Bamboo Mission, the government supports bamboo cultivation, technological improvements, and market linkages for bamboo-based products.
Due to the increasing demand for sustainable products globally and the government's goal of reducing carbon emissions, the demand for bamboo is increasing globally. The global bamboo market is projected to reach $88.42 billion (US $) from 2022 to 2030 at an annual compounded growth rate of 4.5% ('5 (; 12)).
Asia is the largest exporter of bamboo products (83.5% of global export value).
Bamboo tableware, kitchen items, daily use items, woven goods, furniture, shoots, panels, and building materials are the main bamboo items in international trade.
Bamboo covers 3.3% of the world's forest area, with India having the highest estimated 13.96 million hectares (30%). There are 136 species of bamboo in India. India's annual bamboo production capacity is approximately 3.2 million tonnes. India's bamboo industry needs to build a strong value chain and increase domestic production to reduce imports.
Maharashtra is the third-largest bamboo growing state in India (12 per cent) with an area of 13,572 km2 (Madhya Pradesh 17 per cent, Arunachal Pradesh 14 per cent). Considering the arable fallow land and fallow land in Maharashtra, the bamboo production capacity is approximately 157.12 lakh tonnes per annum.
In 2017, the Government of India amended the Indian Forest Act-1927 to promote and transform the bamboo sector.
Accordingly, bamboo grown on non-forest lands was excluded from the AAT called 'tree' in the Act.

It's gone. This legal change makes it easier to harvest and transport bamboo grown on private lands without permits in which bamboo is no longer a "tree" and cut bamboo is no longer a cale wood. Therefore, any bamboo grown on private land by millions of farmers does not need to be plucked or transport permission from any state or forest department.
Sustainable management of various bamboo species in the state is essential to prevent deforestation and land degradation and sustain biodiversity. Through bamboo, it is possible to provide new sources of income for tribal and rural communities. The bamboo sector is still largely neglected in terms of high-value processing and product diversification. A strong value chain needs to be developed for AAA products. There is a need for a policy to create innovative bamboo products by supporting R & D in the bamboo cultivation and processing sector and to promote the export of high-quality value-added bamboo products made from bamboo by reducing the import of bamboo raw materials in the state. Also, Maharashtra's coordination with national programmes such as the National Bamboo Mission requires a bamboo policy to enhance synergy in agriculture, rural development, and industrial policies. Considering the above background, the Maharashtra Bamboo Industry Policy 2025 has been formulated and approved by the State Cabinet. The approval was obtained after in-depth and detailed discussions at a meeting held on October 194, 2025.
Considering all these aspects in totality, it was under the consideration of the government to announce the Bamboo Industry Policy-2025 of Maharashtra.
Government Decision The Government of Maharashtra is approving the Maharashtra Bamboo Industry Policy-2025 with the objective of increasing the production of Bamboo in the Bamboo sector in the state of Maharashtra, bringing the state to the forefront of exports by increasing the bamboo industry and thereby reducing the state's import of Bamboo products. Accordingly, a Marathi and English copy of the Maharashtra Bamboo Industry Policy 2025 has been attached.
A) The Maharashtra Bamboo Industry Policy-2025 should be implemented to increase the contribution of the state of Maharashtra to the global and domestic bamboo sector by creating an ecosystem of bamboo production and allied industries.
b) All public and private sector thermal power plants in the state shall mandatorily mix 5-7% bamboo biomass (coal) with the coal consumed.
e) Maharashtra Bamboo Industry Policy 2025 requires the marketing department to create new markets with the help of the marketing department and make existing markets more efficient and efficient so that bamboo products have market access. Accordingly, separate guidelines should be issued by the Department of Cooperation and Marketing (DoCM) on the implementation and formulation of a market plan for bamboo products.
