INTRODUCTION:
The State of Maharashtra is renowned as Industrially Most Advanced/
Developed State at national level and pioneer in the domestic and foreign direct
investment. Out of the total gross national income, the share of the State is 15% and
it is the largest employment generating state. The statistical data of last 15 years
shows that out of total direct foreign investment made in the country more than 30%
investment has been made in the State of Maharashtra. Strong efforts have been
taken for increasing the industrial investment through the events organized in
Maharashtra like Make in India Week-2016, Magnetic Maharashtra-2018. Apart from
these efforts various exhibitions, seminars, road-shows have also been organized to
attract investment.
The State government has also announced New Industrial Policy-2019 and
various regional industrial policies. The incentives being offered under the package
scheme of incentives of the State Government are attractive in comparison to the
other states.
2. There is an unprecedented slow down in financial and industrial progress
worldwide due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Several global companies from the
neighbouring countries where COVID-19 pandemic has spread are looking for
industrial investment opportunities in other countries with intention to reduce the
dependency on a single country. Such companies are searching for alternatives in
nearby destinations where there is minimum disturbance in the production chain and
the production costs are minimal.
3. In view of this, there are opportunities for growth in the industrial investment in
the State in spite of the lockdown caused by COVID-19 pandemic. The study-group
formed under the chairmanship of the Hon. Minister [Industries] to suggest the
measures to be taken for industrial growth by att ng the foreign investors in the
State, has proposed sustainable, novel and effective measures to facilitate
investments in the State of Maharashtra for the multinational companies of global
level and domestic companies.
