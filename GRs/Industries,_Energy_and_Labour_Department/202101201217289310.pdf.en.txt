Preamble: The State Government has approved the Maharashtra Electronics Policy-2016 and the FAB projects under it.
Incentives" Policy Governance Decision No. MIDHO-2014/ Q.No.118/ Industry-2 dated 11th April, 2016
has been announced. Component Electronics Manufacturers applying under Maharashtra Electronics Policy
To ensure that the component is or how it will be provided under the Maharashtra Electronics Policy-2016
The incentives were linked to the M-SIPS scheme. The concerned component is the electronics manufacturer
Since M-SIPS is a central government scheme, there is a thorough check on whether the component is or not.
The decision to provide incentives under the electronic policy of the State has been taken considering the eligibility criteria fixed under it.
was being taken. However, the central government's M-SIPS scheme has come to an end from January, 2019.
The National Policy on Electronics 2019 has been formulated by the Department of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India.
The notification was issued on February 25, 2019. Accordingly, the Central Govt. Three new schemes have been announced through three different notifications dated 01/04/2020 as follows:
1) SPECS (Scheme for Promotion of Manufacturing of Electronic Components and Semiconductors) 2) PLI (Production Linked Incentive Scheme for Large Scale Electronics Manufacturing) 3) Modified Electronics Manufacturing Clusters (EMC 2.0) Scheme
The Central Government has issued guidelines for the implementation of the above three schemes announced by the Central Government. Issued on 01/06/2020. A Nodal Agency and Project Management Mechanism (PMA) has been provided for determining eligible products and eligibility under SPECS and PLI schemes.

Government Resolution No: MOIDHO-2020/ No. 55/ Industries-2
The scheme was launched under the Modified Special Incentive Package Scheme (M-SIPS). However, since the M-SIPS scheme has come to an end from January, 2019, the State's Electronics Policy-2016 needs to be delinked from the said scheme. After de-linking the state policy from the M-SIPS scheme, it is necessary to create flexibility in giving incentives under the state electronics policy to the industry units in the electronics sector, as well as to provide the benefits of incentives under the said schemes of the Center to the industry units in the state. For this, the incentives given under the Maharashtra Electronics Policy 2016 and FAB should be linked to the Central Government's SPECS and PLI schemes and the State Electronics Policy-2016 should be amended accordingly. Also, the concerned industry units will be given the benefit of SPECS scheme. Application to the Central Government is allowed till 31/03/2023. Therefore, it will take some time to evaluate the gains made in the electronics industry sector after the SPECS scheme is aligned with the state's electronics policy. The deadline must be extended to 31/03/2023.
In view of the above, the State Electronics Policy-2016 is being amended to de-link the State Electronics Policy-2016 from the Central Government's M-SIPS Scheme and to align it with the Central Government's SPECS and PLI schemes, to allow incentives under the State Electronics Policy for the electronic components included in these schemes, as well as the existing State Electronics Policy-2016. The matter of extending the deadline till 31/03/2023 was under consideration of the government.
Government's decision
The Maharashtra Electronics Policy-2016 and the Government Decision dated 11/04/2016

2016. Amendments to paragraphs 3 and 13 of the Government Decision dated 11/04/2016 to the Maharashtra Electronics Policy-2016 and to the FAB Project under it
Incentives are the Department of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India
policy in 2019. The SPECS and PLI announced vide notifications dated 01/04/2020 are being aligned with these schemes.
2) State Fabs to boost the manufacturing of semiconductors and integrated chips in the state
All the incentives mentioned in the policy are being made permissible for the following specified components:
Compound semiconductors such as GaN, SiC, GaAs, etc. and Silicon Photonics devices/ Integrated Circuits, Optoelectronic Components, Semiconductor Wafers, Semiconductor Integrated Chips (ICs) including Logic [Microprocessors, Microcontrollers, Digital Signal Processors (DSPs), Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), etc. Memory; Analog/ Mixed Signal ICs, Display Fabrication
Units including Liquid Crystal Displays (LCD), Light Emitting Diode (LED), Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED), etc. for electronic applications. "

The five-year fixed period of the existing Electronics Policy-2016 of the State
It will expire on 10/04/2021. However, SPECS provides the relevant industry components to avail the benefits of the scheme. The existing Electronics Policy-2016 of the State has been amended so that applications can be submitted to the Central Government by 31/03/2023. Continued from 10/04/2021. The deadline has been extended to 31/03/2023.
The incentives of the prevailing electronics policy of the states will automatically apply to the units which will be sanctioned incentives under the SPECS and PLI scheme of the Central Government. However, if any entity, which for any reason has not accepted the incentives of the Central Government, invests in the State, the prevailing electronics policy of the State Government will be applicable to them with the consent of the Expert Committee mentioned above and the incentives will be admissible accordingly.
Incentives for large projects will be admissible as per the Electronics Policy-2016 to the industrial units investing in the following sub-segments as per the criteria laid down for large projects in the Electronics Policy-2016 by new industrial units or expanding units which are significant in terms of increasing investment and employment generation in the electronics sector in the State.
a) Telecom Products
b) Consumer Electronics
c) Health and Medical Electronics
d) Industrial Electronics
e) Automotive Electronics
f) Strategic Electronics
g) Avionics
h) Electronics Manufacturing Services
