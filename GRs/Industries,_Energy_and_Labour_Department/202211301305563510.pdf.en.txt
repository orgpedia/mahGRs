The Proposal:
The Transmission Linked/ Non-Transmission Combined Non-Conventional Energy Generation Policy-2020 for power generation projects from new and renewable (non-conventional) energy sources of the State has been announced vide Government Resolution dated 31.12.2020. Transmission Linked and Non-Transmission Linked Non-Conventional Energy Projects set up/ commissioned under the said Non-Conventional Energy Generation Policy
The procedure to be announced under the Government Decision dated 11.05.2022
has come.
After the announcement of this policy, the major stake holder in the construction of non-conventional energy projects will have to go to the government and the power sector to build non-conventional energy projects.
The huge investment, the electricity generated in the state, the employment generated and the collateral benefits, the high cost of land in the state compared to other states, and so on.
It was requested to provide financial assistance in the form of concessional/ subsidy from the government to reduce the difference in the sale price of electricity and to provide affordable rates as compared to states. Considering this demand and to make the state the top in the country in the field of non-conventional energy, the Non-Conventional Energy Policy-2020 will facilitate non-conventional energy generation projects.
Incentive reforms by including financial assistance in the form of rebates/ subsidies have been announced vide Government Resolution dated 30.06.2022. This is encouraging
The matter of determining the modalities for the reforms was under the consideration of the government.

Government Decision: The Government is approving the modalities prescribed for implementation of the following Incentive Reforms in Non-Conventional Energy Generation Policy-2020 by including financial support in the form of incentives/ subsidies to Non-Conventional Energy Projects: 1. Extension of time limit for commissioning of Transmission Linked Solar Power Projects registered with M/ s.
Non-conventional energy projects which have been granted registration letter during the policy period of 2015 under the Non-Conventional Energy Generation Policy-2020 and where the project holder was entitled to register the projects under the policy in the next three months after the announcement of the policy, will be eligible for the benefits of incentives mentioned in the policy of 2015 if the projects are commissioned within one year of the announcement of the new policy. The government had twice extended the deadline for registering solar power projects that could not be registered during this period. However, since no extension has been given to complete the project, the state government has decided to implement the 418 MW power project registered under the 2015 policy. One year from 6.06.2022 (d. 05.06.2023) has been extended vide Government Order dated 30.06.2022.
The developers/ project holders of such projects shall apply to the General Authority for extension of project-wise project timelines for execution of the projects.
â†’ After receiving the application for such an extension, the government decides to propose an extension after examining the documents related to the extension. It will submit to the Department of Power to place the projects before the Committee constituted under the Chairmanship of Principal Secretary (Power) for extension of time as on December 13, 2021.
After the approval of the committee and completion of the project within the stipulated time frame by the project holder, the MSEDCL shall approve the project to be implemented in the prescribed manner within the limits of the objective of the Energy Policy.
The other provisions of the Government Decision dated 20.07.2015 and Procedure dated 09.09.2015 on Non-Conventional Energy Generation Policy, 2015 shall continue to apply.
Under the State's New Non-Conventional Energy Generation Policy-2020, the electricity generated by industries setting up self-consumption solar, wind, urban and industrial solid waste power generation and sugarcane-based power generation plants will be waived off for the first 10 years from the date of commissioning of the project.

Government Resolution No: APAU-2021/ PR No.224/ (Part-4)/ Energy-7
Power generation from solar, wind, urban and industrial solid waste and sugarcane based cogeneration plants to be set up under the Non-Conventional Energy Generation Policy-2020 will be provided power tariff waiver for the first 10 years from the date of commissioning of the project, if the power generated from such plants is used for self-consumption.
Once the project is commissioned, the developer will submit a proposal to the Chief Electrical Inspector for waiver of electricity charges for the registered project.
The Chief Inspector of Electricity will scrutinize such proposal and submit the proposal of electricity duty waiver to the Department of Energy along with the feedback.
After such proposal is approved by the Principal Secretary, Power, the Chief Inspector of Electricity and MSEDCL will take further necessary action accordingly.
The Chief Inspector of Electricity and MSEDCL will submit quarterly and annual reports to the government on electricity duty waiver.
Under the Non-Conventional Energy Generation Policy-2020, solar power plants will be set up on unutilized land owned by state government corporations and agricultural universities.
The distribution companies or third parties can sell electricity by entering into a power purchase agreement as per the prevailing laws/ rules. For this, the concerned Corporations/ Agricultural Universities/ Project Developers/ Project Holders should take action for setting up of the project as per APAW Policy 2020 dated 31st December, 2020 and Procedure dated 11th May, 2022.
Action will be taken by MAHAYURAJ after taking into consideration the rules of Maharashtra State Electricity Regulatory Commission, guidelines of MSEDCL, MSEDCL and the orders of the State Government regarding the replacement of the previously installed non-transmission solar power plant on all government/ semi-government buildings in the state with a hybrid grid tie inverter (hybrid) and netmetering connected to the transmission through MAHAYURAJ where the installed batteries are in disrepair. The scheme will be implemented in about 100 government/ semi-government offices every year as per the availability of funds for the purpose. The concerned government/ semi-government office will conduct a technical survey through the Divisional Office of the General Power and submit the proposal along with the budget price to the General Power Headquarters.
It has been approved in principle to develop solar/ wind based pilot energy storage projects through Mahavirja and after the development of the latest technology in this regard, Mahavirja will submit the proposal to the Department of Energy for final approval: 1) Consultants will be selected and given work instructions to prepare a detailed project report for setting up solar/ wind based pilot energy storage projects at the site of Mahavirja.

2) Once the detailed project report is ready, the Maha Urja will submit the proposal to the government.
(3) Such proposal/ project is approved by the Department of Energy. The administrative approval for the energy storage project will be given with the approval of the Cabinet.
4) The project will be implemented by adopting e-tendering by the General Authority after administrative approval.
Project holders/ developers should submit a proposal to the Revenue and Forest Department regarding waiver of non-farm taxes for solar and wind power generation projects under the Non-Conventional Energy Generation Policy-2020.
Under the State Non-Conventional Energy Generation Policy-2020, it has been made mandatory for the power distribution companies in the state to procure 50% of the power required for their total non-conventional energy bonding (RPO) from non-conventional energy projects in the state. Approval has been given to file a petition through the High Court to the Electricity Regulatory Commission. Action should be taken in this regard immediately. In the petition, Further action will be taken as per the directions of the Commission. It will be approved by the Cabinet.
8. All other provisions contained in the Non-Conventional Energy Generation Policy-2020 and the Government Orders dated 30.03.2022, 11.05.2022 and 30.06.2022 regarding Incentive Reforms under the Transnational Energy Generation Policy-2020 shall also continue to apply/ remain in force.
