It has an annual coal requirement of 41.586 MT.
Chandrapur Unit No. 8& 9 (2X500M.W.), Koradi Set No. 8, 9& 10 (3X660MW) and Parali Set No. 8 (1X250MW) coal mine in Gare Palma sector of Chhattisgarh State for use in power stations. As per letter dated 24.03.2015, the General Construction Company has been allotted. The Company has entered into an original agreement dated 30.03.2015 with the Ministry of Mines, Government of India for development of Gare Palma Sector-I Coal Mine. The revised agreement has been signed on 31.08.2015. The coal for the above power station will be supplied from this mine for the next 30 years. The coal from this mine will be transported through the existing Jharsuguda-Nagpur railway line. However, the Jharsuguda-Rajnandgaon section of the line is saturated with 100% train traffic. Chhattisgarh is home to 18% of India's mineral reserves and transporting those reserves will make it impossible for the state's thermal power plants to transport coal through it in the future. Keeping in view the likely situation and the consequent difficulties, the Company, after consultation with the Government of Chhattisgarh, Indian Railways and officials of the Department of Geology and Mines, Chhattisgarh, has proposed a new railway line from Katghora-Dongargarh, which is independent and parallel to the existing railway line, for transporting coal from Gare Palma Sector-|| Coal Mine to the Thermal Power Plants of the Company, considering the option of providing separate and parallel railway line to the existing railway line.
