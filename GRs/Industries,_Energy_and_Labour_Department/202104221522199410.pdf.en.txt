3) Government Decision, Department of Industry, Energy and Labor No. Apau-2020/ No. 137/ Energy-7, d. 31/12/2020
The Proposal:
Under the State's New Non-Conventional Energy Policy-2020 announced under the Government Decision dated December 31, 2020, the non-conventional energy projects that have been given registration during the policy period of 2015 and 2016 have been registered with the General Energy Department.
The deadline for this has been given till March 31, 2021, but due to the massive increase in the impact of the Corona epidemic across the country in 2020, the complete lockdown in the country, the situation arising out of it, etc., such non-conventional energy projects have not been registered with MAHAYURGA on time.
In view of the growing impact of the Corona epidemic and the lockdown-like situation in the state, the date for registering such non-conventional energy projects with the Maha Energy Corporation has been extended to March 31, 2020.
The government is planning to extend the deadline to 2021.
Government Decision: State New Non-Conventional Energy Generation Policy-2020 dated 31st March, 2020
The government has taken the decision. As per this policy, the non-conventional energy projects which have been given registration letter during the policy period of 2015 and 2016 will be registered with the General Authority of Power under the respective policies of 2015 and 2016.
However, as per the new Non-Conventional Energy Generation Policy-2020 of the State, the benefits of incentives mentioned in the policy for such projects will be admissible only if the project is commissioned within one year from the date of announcement of the new policy.
