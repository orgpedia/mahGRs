Maharashtra Small Industries Development Corporation Limited Letter No. Maluwim/ Coir/ 2023-24/ CR- 169/525, dated 04/12/2023.
The Proposal:
Coir fibre is known to be an environmentally friendly and future-proof natural fibre. Eco-friendly coir from coconut is a great alternative to synthetic yarn. Coconut oil is used as a raw material for the production of cinnamon. The industry of making yarn from coir is known as village industry, while other goods made from coir fall partly under village industry and partly under industry. In Maharashtra, coconut is grown mainly in the Konkan region. Therefore, there is a huge scope for setting up the coir industry in the Konkan region. A total of 17,555 hectares of land has been covered in Sindhudurg district, which is 60.69 per cent of the total coconut cultivated area in Maharashtra. The area under coconut cultivation in Sindhudurg district is 68.40 per cent of the area under coconut cultivation in the Konkan region. In the Konkan region, coconut husk is used as fuel.
There are very few industries in Konkan to produce coir from coconut husk. In Konkan, no other kind of products other than coir are produced from coconut husk. Apart from Sindhudurg district, coconut husk is also available in large quantities in other districts. Coconut husk can be processed to produce coir and other coir products. Industry training using the potential resources of coconut husk can provide a large number of industry opportunities in this sector.
As coconut production is on the rise in Ratnagiri district like Sindhudurg district, the government was considering setting up a coir industry community facility centre there to provide employment opportunities to women and youth of Ratnagiri district.

GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: MALIV-2023/ PR No.157/ INDUSTRY-6 GOALS:
(i) To produce maximum amount of coir from the available coconut husk in Ratnagiri district and thereby provide new employment to the coconut producing farmers through sale of husk.
2) To empower local women by training them to make ropes and other items from coir.
3) To provide employment to women by giving them the coir produced in this collective facility and making ropes from it.
4) To provide coir to promote other coir products industries.
The expected benefits...
After the coir production starts in the coir plant set up by the Maharashtra Small Industries Development Corporation, the coir will be supplied to other small producers by the corporation.
2) The local production of coir will make it available at a cheaper rate to the industry units producing other products of coir containing raw material.
3. Setting up of Community Facilitation Centres will enable setting up of small coir based industries, providing them with high technology machinery and producing quality products.
Setting up of Community Facilitation Centre and Work Plan: The main objective of this Centre will be to provide coir to empower women and to encourage them to produce other products from coir in Ratnagiri district. The required land for the centre should be purchased or leased by the government and the centre should be built on it. Interested trainees/ self-help groups will be able to create their products using the machinery at this centre.
The centre will be run by women self-help groups with an agreement between local interested women self-help groups and the corporation. The coir produced at this centre should be supplied to other local industrial units as well as to women. Local women should be allowed to make ropes from coir. The profit earned by the centre from the sale of this rope, coir and coir husk will go to the women self-help group running the centre. Coir will be sold at a nominal profit over the production cost of the coir produced from this centre, which will enable entrepreneurs/ artisans to sell their products at competitive prices by making the coir available near their place of business. This will provide employment to local women.
After determining the location of the Community Facilitation Center, the necessary land for it should be requested to the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation through the Maharashtra Small Industries Development Corporation.
Necessary decision for manpower required for setting up of Community Facilitation Centre and its smooth running will be taken by the State Government with the advice and approval of the Finance Department.
