Introduction: The thermal power stations of Maharashtra State Power Generation (Mahanirmiti) Company in the state were earlier operated by the Central Government's Coal India Limited. Coal was being supplied as per demand by its subsidiaries WCL, SCCL etc. But after that, in accordance with the provisions of the Central Government's Electricity Act, 2003, private companies entered the power generation sector and since the thermal power plants of these companies needed coal, the Central Government changed the policy of allocation of coal mines.
Regarding this policy. The Supreme Court In pursuance of the decision taken on 25th August, 2014, the Central Government has enacted the Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015 (11 of 2015).
As per the provisions of the Act, coal mines are now allocated to all state-owned power generation companies, including private ones, by the Union Ministry of Coal. Therefore, the power generation companies of the state have the responsibility to develop the coal mines allocated to them and get coal from them.
The coal mines allotted to the Maharashtra State Power Generation (Mahanirmiti) Company have been de-notified by the Ministry of Coal in accordance with the provisions of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957. April 22, 2015 and d. Coal mines are required to be developed as per the guidelines issued on 5th August, 2015. For this, the government was considering the matter of appointing a committee to consider such a proposal from the construction company at the government level and take an appropriate decision in this regard.
Government's decision:
Maharashtra State Power Generation (Mahanirmiti) Company has been appointed as Mine Developer& Operator for development of coal mines allocated to it by the Ministry of Coal, Government of India. The Government has decided to appoint a" High Level Committee" under the Chairmanship of the Chief Secretary as follows:
