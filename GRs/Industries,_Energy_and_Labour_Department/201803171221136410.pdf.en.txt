Preamble: The traditional electricity can be saved to a great extent if the agricultural lines in the rural areas of the state where the village and agricultural lines are isolated are electrified through solar energy.
Such saved power can be used for other productive purposes, which will reduce the cost of power purchase by MSEDCL and save conventional power. It will also help in increasing the revenue of MSEDCL and will also help in keeping the electricity tariff low for commercial and industrial consumers. In view of all these things and to provide electricity supply to the farmers of the state at affordable prices and according to their convenience, the government was considering to start the Solar Agriculture Channel Scheme in the state. According to reference no. Under the decision of the government here, the" Chief Minister Solar Agriculture Channel Scheme" was implemented in the state. Ahmednagar and Kolambi.
Pilot projects have been approved in Yavatmal. There were some issues in implementation/ execution of these projects which were brought to the notice of the implementing agencies and supporting agencies. In order to ensure the proper implementation of the scheme in accordance with Article 23 of the scheme, a committee has been constituted under the chairmanship of the Principal Secretary (Energy).
