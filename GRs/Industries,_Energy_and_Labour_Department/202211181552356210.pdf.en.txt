Our country has adopted a democratic system and all registered citizens above the age of 18 are expected to vote in every election. As per Rule 135 (b) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 (2 of 1951), on the day of poll, the electors are generally given leave to exercise their franchise, or in some cases, are given suitable relaxation in working hours.
However, in the last few elections, it has been observed that institutions/ establishments etc. do not provide paid holidays or concessions. So many voters have to be deprived of their vote, which is very dangerous for democracy.
