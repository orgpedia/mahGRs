Introduction: The above reference No. 1 The Government hereby amends the Government Order in Reference No. Under section 2, the Government has issued guidelines regarding the allocation of coal to small and medium enterprises in the state of Maharashtra through the government-appointed mechanism.
Paragraph 5.2 of the said Government Decision provides for allocation of slack coal to the brick manufacturing units. No. 6 provides for constitution of a supervisory team by the concerned District Industries Centre for inspection/ control of coal supplied through the Government designated machinery at intervals to control whether the industrial units use the coal for their own production or not. However, the Government decision does not provide for the utilization of coal supplied to brick manufacturing units for their own production.
While distributing coal during the intervening period, 1) The Nag Vidarbha Bricks Manufacturers Association, Nagpur 2) Nanded District Backward Classes Kumbhar Samaj Brick Manufacturers Association have requested the government to provide mixed-crussRom coal of lower quality than the slack variety due to non-availability of slack variety of coal.
Accordingly, the Maharashtra State Mining Corporation, Nagpur and the Development Commissioner (Industries), Directorate of Industries, Mumbai, have recommended that there should be no objection to the distribution of mix-crusRom coal of lower quality than the slack copy. That's why. To partially modify the provision set out in paragraph 5.2 of the Government Decision of 12/07/2016 and The matter of assigning responsibility to check whether the coal supplied to the brick manufacturing units in No. 6 is being used by their own brick manufacturing units was under consideration of the Government.
