Government Circular No. - SANKOORN 2025 / P.No.200 / WORKERS-9
Mantralaya, Mumbai 400 032
Date: 19/12/2025
Reference: - State Election Commission, State of Maharashtra No. Rania / NAP-2025 / No. 14 / Ka. 6, D. Letter of the day 18/12/2025.
Government Circular: -
Our country has adopted a democratic system, with registered citizens over the age of 18 expected to vote in every election. In view of this, Section 135 (b) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 provides for paid leave on the day of poll to enable voters to exercise their right to vote or, in some cases, appropriate strength in working hours. However, in the last few elections, it has been observed that some organizations / establishments etc. do not provide paid leave or concessions to their workers. As a result, many voters are deprived of their right to vote, which is extremely dangerous for democracy.
2. As per the order issued by the State Election Commission in the letters under reference. General elections to Municipal Councils and Nagar Panchayats are to be held on 20/12/2025 as mentioned in the accompanying Annexures-9 and 2. In order to enable all electors to exercise their right to vote properly in these elections and in the elections in the districts bordering the State of Maharashtra as mentioned in Annexure-9 and 2, the following orders are issued: -
a) Workers / officers / employees who are voters in the polling area where the election is to be held, even if they are working outside the polling area for work, should be given paid leave to exercise their franchise on the day of the election.
b) The holiday shall apply to all establishments, factories, shops, etc., falling under Industries, Energy, Labour, etc. (e.g. Establishments in private companies, all shops and other establishments, residential, hotel, eateries, other houses, theatres, trade, industrial undertakings or other establishments as well as IT companies, shopping centres, malls, retailers, etc.)
a) The establishment owners concerned shall be required to take care that in exceptional circumstances, if it is not possible to give full day leave to the concerned officers, staff, workers, etc. in respect of dangerous or public service or establishments where the absence would cause great loss, then there shall be a special provision of two to three hours in lieu of leave to exercise the right to vote.

d) The owners / management of all establishments, factories, shops, etc., falling under the Department of Industries, Power and Labour, as mentioned above, shall strictly ensure that the above instructions are duly complied with.
It is not possible to vote because the voter does not receive the appropriate coupon or discount for voting.
If complaints are received, action will be taken against the establishments concerned.
