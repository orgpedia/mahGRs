Preamble: It deals with the establishment of the Directorate of Government Printing and Stationery under this Department and the 8 Government Printing Presses in the State under it. This department is a service-cum-commercial department and the printing works of all the departments under the government are carried out through the printing presses of the directorate. Accordingly, technical cadres are working in these printing presses. Due to the changes that have taken place in the printing technology over time and in line with the modern technology, the work of some technical posts has increased while the work of some technical working posts has decreased. Accordingly, due to the expiry of posts in some cadres and shortage of work for some cadres, it was decided to transfer/ convert the posts in those cadres into posts with more work scope. Accordingly, the Directorate has submitted a proposal for transfer of a total of 32 posts as per the above letter.
Accordingly, the matter of conversion of these technical posts was under consideration of the Government. The government has taken the following decisions:
