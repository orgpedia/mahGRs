To study the impact of global import duty changes on the state's export-oriented industries and to set up a state-level committee to suggest measures.
Government of Maharashtra
Industries, Energy, Labour and Mining Department
Government Decision No: SAPROYOI-2025 / P.No.278 / Udyog-8
Madam Cama Road, Martyr Rajguru Chowk,
Mantralaya, Mumbai - 400 032
Date: 18th August, 2025
The Proposal: -
Major industries in the state are being affected by the global trade tensions created internationally and the new import duty policy. Since August 10, 2025, the United States has implemented a 50 percent tax structure. (The 25 per cent tax announced on July 31, which came into effect at 9.30 am IST on August 7, and a further 25 per cent penal tax, due by August 27, 2025).
India is among the 60 trade partners targeted to balance the US trade deficit and balance of payments issues. The new tax regime threatens the competitiveness of Indian exporters in one of their largest markets, as the US accounts for 18 per cent of India's exports, accounting for 2.2 per cent of India's GDP. The impact of change by other international organisations of a similar nature on the state's export-oriented industries needs to be regularly reviewed.
To protect our economy and shareholders, the government was considering setting up the committee in line with Maharashtra's policy interventions such as proactive measures to mitigate these impacts, export diversification, sector-specific incentives, infrastructure upgradation, and aligning with the central government's trade policies to ensure flexibility against these protectionist policies while exploring opportunities for growth in alternative markets.
Government Decisions: - It is being approved to constitute the following Committee to study the impact of the global import duty structure on the state and take measures.
