Our country has adopted a democratic system and all registered citizens above the age of 18 are expected to vote in every election. As per Rule 135 (b) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 (2 of 1951), on the day of poll, the electors are generally given leave to exercise their franchise, or in some cases, are given suitable relaxation in working hours. However, in the last few elections, it has been observed that institutions/ establishments etc. do not provide paid holidays or concessions. So many voters have to be deprived of their vote, which is very dangerous for democracy.
As per the order issued by the Election Commission of India, 276-Kolhapur North Assembly Constituency in Maharashtra. The by-election will be held on April 12, 2022. In order to enable all the electors to exercise their right to vote in the said election, it is hereby ordered as under: (i) Workers/ officers/ employees who are electors in the polling area where the election is to be held, shall be given paid leave to exercise their right to vote on the day of election, even if they are working outside the area where the election is to be held.
(ii) This holiday shall be applicable to all groups of industries, corporations, companies and institutions, industrial undertakings or other establishments, etc. under the Department of Industry, Energy and Labour.
(iii) In exceptional circumstances, where it is not possible to grant full day leave to the workers, officers, employees etc., at least two hours may be granted in lieu of leave to the workers in the polling area to exercise their franchise. However, prior permission of the District Collector and the District Election Officer will be required for this. In any case, the concerned establishments will have to ensure that voters get at least two hours of relaxation for voting.
(iv) All corporations, industrial groups, companies and institutions under the Department of Industries, Energy and Labour, etc., shall ensure that the above instructions are strictly complied with. If voters complain that they are not able to cast their votes due to lack of proper leave or concession for voting, appropriate action will be taken against them.
