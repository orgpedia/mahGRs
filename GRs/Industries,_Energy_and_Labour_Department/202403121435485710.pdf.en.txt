Government Decision No: Sink 2024 / Q. No.04 / Energy-5
Madame Cama Road, Hutatma Rajguru Chowk, Mantralaya, Mumbai-400 032.
Date: 12th March, 2024
Reference: Letter from Chairman & Managing Director, MSEDCL No. 37653, D. 28.12.2023
Preamble: The network of 33 kV power lines in the tribal areas of Dindori Peth constituency in Nashik district is approximately 25 to 30 years old and its capacity is insufficient to meet the current load on the network. This outdated and dilapidated power distribution system is hampering the supply of uninterrupted and quality power to its consumers. There is also an increased risk of electrical accidents in the area. For this, the power distribution system needs to be improved and renovated. Also, the leak line work will reduce the distribution system overload and enable load management. This will enable uninterrupted and quality power supply to the consumers in the region. It will also reduce power distribution losses and help prevent electrical accidents.
2. For various electrical works in Dindori Peth constituency, Rs. The proposal for funding of 74.92 crores has been technically examined and submitted by the MSEDCL. The proposal was given administrative approval and a sum of Rs. The government was considering making available the 74.92 crore fund for the 2023-24 year under the tribal application.
The government's decision:
For various electrical works in Dindori Peth constituency, Rs. Administrative sanction is being accorded for the following works at a cost of 74.92 crores.
