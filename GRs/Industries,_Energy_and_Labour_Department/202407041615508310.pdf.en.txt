The Proposal:
The number of regional offices in the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation is increasing.
This is very low compared to industrialization. In recent times, the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation's jurisdiction has been greatly increased by the subsequent industrialization of its operations.
There is a single regional office of the Maui Corporation for two-three districts at many places.
As a result, entrepreneurs in the area are not allowed to work in regional offices.
One has to travel by air. Also, the proposed new regional office area will require manpower for the industrial sector.
