Preamble: "Information Technology and IT-enabled Services Policy-2023" of the State of Maharashtra Reference No. 1 here. The announcement has been made by a government decision dated 27.06.2023. The government's decision. 4 includes various incentives to support the development of IT cities and IT parks, to promote the growth and development of IT and IT enabled services related infrastructure in the state. However, the New IT Policy-2023 was not clear on granting the benefit of Additional Floor Area Directive (751) mentioned under the new policy to IT parks to which letters of intent have been issued under the earlier policy, as well as allowing mixed use of space. Accordingly, Reference No. 4 here. A proposal to this effect was submitted by the Directorate of Industries in a letter dated 16.04.2025. As per the proposal, IT parks approved under the earlier IT and ITeS Policy will be given additional floor area references in the IT and ITeS PAT Policy-2023 to allow incentives for mixed sale of land and to fix modalities under the ITeS Policy-2023 for regularisation of unregistered parks. The Empowered Committee headed by the Chief Secretary, Shri. The approval has been given in the meeting held on 19.05.2025.
Therefore, the IT parks approved in the earlier policies under the IT / ITeS Policy-2023 will have additional floor area directories in this policy as well.
