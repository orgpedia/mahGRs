Preamble: The electricity tariff concessions for scheduled tribe agricultural pump consumers, machinery consumers, textile consumers and industrial consumers in the state are being budgeted under the same head 28015525. This includes all funding. But in reality, the funds were less than the demand and there were difficulties in disbursing funds under different schemes. Therefore, as per the directions of the Finance Department, the concerned individual beneficiaries of the Scheduled Tribes will henceforth be provided financial assistance to the MSEDCL for providing concession in power tariff to the agricultural pump consumers, machinery consumers, textile consumers and industrial consumers from the funds received under the Tribal Component Programme. The matter of opening a separate new head of account under T-05, Head Account Head 2801- Electricity, was under the consideration of the Government.
Government Decision: Under the Tribal Component Programme, it is being approved to open new scheme-wise head accounts to provide financial assistance to MSEDCL for providing concession in electricity tariff to agricultural pump consumers, machinery consumers, textile consumers and industrial consumers.
(1) Concession in electricity tariff to the consumers of agricultural pumps (Tribal Component Programme):
