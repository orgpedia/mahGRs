Our country has adopted a democratic system and all registered people above the age of 18 are expected to cast 100 per cent votes in every election. In view of this, as per Section 135B of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, on the day of poll, the electors are generally given a paid holiday or, in some cases, a reasonable relaxation in working hours to enable them to exercise their franchise. However, in the last few elections, it has been observed that institutions/ establishments etc. do not provide paid holidays or concessions. This deprives many voters of their right to vote, which is very dangerous for democracy.
As per the order of the State Election Commission. As stated in Annexure-B annexed as on 11th December, 2020 and d. General elections to Gram Panchayats as mentioned in Annexure-II are scheduled to be held on 16th December, 2020. In order to enable all voters to exercise their right to vote in this election, the following orders are being issued: Workers/ officers/ employees who are voters in the polling area where the election is to be held, shall be given leave to exercise their franchise on the day of election even if they are working outside the area where the election is to be held for the purpose of work.
(ii) This holiday will be applicable to all establishments, factories, shops etc. under the Department of Industries, Energy and Labour (e.g. (iii) In exceptional circumstances, where it is not possible to grant full day leave to workers, officers, employees etc., workers in the polling area may be given a relaxation of at least two hours in lieu of leave to exercise their franchise. However, the District Collector and the District Election Officer have been informed.
