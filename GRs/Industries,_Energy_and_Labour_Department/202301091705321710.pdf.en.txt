The Proposal:
Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, Government of India is implementing Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha evam Utthan Mahabhiyan (KUSUM) for farmers across the country with a mission to electrify the agricultural pump power connections in the State through solar energy. The Government has approved the implementation of the Mission as per the guidelines of the Maha Abhiyan issued by the Central Government on 22nd July, 2019 and its objectives, modalities, implementation, provision of funds, financial grants and implementation of the Mission in the State through the State Nodal Agency (Maharashtra Urja Vikas Agency) vide Government Resolution dated 12th May, 2021.
A total of 2,00,000 non-transmission solar pumps have been sanctioned to Maharashtra by the Central Government at the end of August, 2022 under Component B for installation of non-transmission solar agri pumps. Out of these 2,00,000 non-transmission solar agricultural pumps, 1,00,000 non-transmission solar agricultural pumps are being implemented by Maha Urja.

It's been approved. Now the remaining 1,00,000 newly approved solar agricultural pumps by the central government were under the consideration of the state nodal agency (Maharashtra Energy Development Agency) for the payment of the long-awaited agricultural pump power connections demanded by the MSEDCL in the state.
Government's decision:
Under Component B on Installation of Transmission Free Solar Krishi Pumps under Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha evam Utthan Mahabhiyan (KUSUM), out of total 2,00,000 Transmission Free Solar Krishi Pumps sanctioned to Maharashtra at the end of August, 2022, the Central Government is approving installation of 1,00,000 newly sanctioned Transmission Free Solar Krishi Pumps through State Nodal Agency (Maharashtra Urja Vikas Agency) for the long pending demand of the State for installation of Krishi Pump Power connections by MSEDCL.
1) The criteria for the implementation of the scheme as laid down by the Ministry of Non-Conventional Energy, Government of India, as well as the original Government Resolution No. Department of Energy and Labor No. All the remaining provisions of SOURCE 2019/ PR No. 268/ URJA-7, dated 12.05.2021 shall continue to apply as it is and all norms shall be strictly adhered to by MSEDCL and MSEDCL while implementing the scheme.
2) The portal has been developed by the State Nodal Agency (MAHAURJ) for the implementation of the scheme in the state. MSEDCL shall take necessary action to incorporate MSEDCL as a parallel implementation mechanism in the said portal for using the online portal created by the State Nodal Agency with the help of MSEDCL and the expenditure for the same shall be borne by MSEDCL.
3) While determining the number of solar agricultural pumps district-wise under Kusum component' B," the number of solar agricultural pumps should be determined in proportion to the rural population excluding the urban population.
To carry out all these activities, the coordination of the mega energy plan will play its role.
Similarly, considering the demand for solar agricultural pumps in the district, care should be taken to ensure that pumps are installed in all the talukas of the district in a fair amount. Since the pumps will be distributed to the beneficiaries in the paid pending list under this scheme, if the demand for solar agricultural pumps is less in a district, then more solar pumps in that district should be diverted with the approval of the steering committee in the district where there is demand.
4) Once the solar agricultural pump is installed, the beneficiary will not be able to sell it, if it is found that such a sale has been made, then a case should be registered against the beneficiary and if the crime is proved, then the beneficiary will not be eligible for the benefit of any scheme of the state government or the central government.
This condition will also be implemented by Mahavikastha and MSEDCL respectively.
