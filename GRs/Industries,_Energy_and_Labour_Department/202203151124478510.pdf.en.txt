Reference: (1). On the 9th November 2021. Minutes of the review meeting chaired by the Minister (Power).
The Proposal:
Various projects, schemes, policies, etc. are implemented with the help of this fund. The success of the projects/ schemes/ policies implemented under such schemes/ policies is ultimately the objective.
It depends on the future and its usefulness. Considering the difficulties, technicalities and limitations in implementation, it needs to be reviewed from time to time for such improvements in future implementation as well as changes in the experience gained. This can be leveraged for optimum utilization of the funds/ resources created under such projects.
As per Section (1) of the Act, The Minister (Energy). On November 09, 2021, the infrastructure projects implemented by MSEDCL from 2014 to 2019 were reviewed. During the review, the objectives, achievements and end-use of various schemes launched by MSEDCL were discussed. It was also discussed that the implementation of such projects should be completed by correcting the shortcomings in view of their actual utility.
MSEDCL has taken up works to strengthen the power distribution system in the state. But due to various reasons such works were not completed within the stipulated/ expected time, its expected effectiveness was not seen. Further, it was highlighted to examine the implementation of the projects on the basis of implementation errors, financial burden etc.
In order to examine the reasons for the failure of the previous projects, the government has now decided to examine the infrastructure projects implemented by MSEDCL in various parts of the country and to benefit from them in future schemes
