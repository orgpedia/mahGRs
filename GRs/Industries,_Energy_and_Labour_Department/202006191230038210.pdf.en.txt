The Proposal:
In order to make it possible for the farmers to irrigate during the day and to achieve the goal of saving the state government on the cost of connecting the traditional agricultural pumps and the subsidy provided by the state government, the" Mukhyamantri Solar Krishi Pump Yojana" has been approved by the government decision dated November 15, 2018 and September 11, 2019 to provide 1 lakh non-transmission solar agricultural pumps to the farmers of the state for agricultural use in a phased manner. " Mukhyamantri Solar Krishi Pump Yojana" is a fully state government scheme under which it is planned to install one lakh solar Krishi Pumps in a phased manner in the next 3 years. In the first phase, 25,000 nos of solar pumps will be installed and in the second and third phases, 75,000 nos of solar pumps will be installed. The general category beneficiaries will be given 10 per cent of the state's budgetary allocation, 10 per cent of the beneficiary share and the remaining 80 per cent will be paid from the mutual amount collected from the tax on sale of surplus power in the escrow account of the distribution company.
As per the decision of the government, 118 percent of the state government's subsidy for the general category beneficiaries of 75,000 solar agricultural pumps in the second phase has been calculated at Rs 10. 36 crore. For this purpose, a provision of Rs.100.3 crore has been made for the department against the budgetary provision of Rs.37098 crore.

The Department has issued orders for disbursement of Rs. 52.62902 crore out of the remaining budgetary provisions within the limit of 8th Revised Estimates approved vide Government Resolution dated 19th March, 2020. However, the payment of the said amount could not be submitted to the Treasury due to restrictions imposed by the Finance Department on the disbursement of funds in the circumstances arising out of the outbreak of COVID-19 virus in the State.
Consequently, an amount of Rs. 96.62902 crore had to be surrendered as on 31.03.2020. Now, taking into consideration the suggestions of the Department of Finance in the Government Resolution dated 04.05.2020, the pending payments for the financial year 2019-2020 will have to be met from the available provisions of the financial year 2020-21.
Overall, subject to the formula that only 33% of the budgeted funds will be available in 2020-2021 for the schemes under the program, the Finance Department was considering to disburse 10% of the budgeted amount of Rs. 250.00 crore for the first three months of the financial year 2020-2021 to MSEDCL in cash.
Government's decision:
" Mukhyamantri Solar Krishi Pump Yojana" is a fully state government scheme, under which 10 percent of the state government's budget grant will be given to the general category beneficiaries.
