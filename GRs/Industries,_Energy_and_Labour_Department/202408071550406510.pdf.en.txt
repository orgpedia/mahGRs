The Proposal: -
The Government vide Decision No. Central Government to develop wind power projects under 1.
Issued on 22.10.2016 date, the guidelines include Issue No. Microsighting at 5
The guidelines have been applied to wind power plants in the state.
However, now the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, Government of India, has issued the reference No. 2 here.
Previous date 22.10.2016 of the Central Government vide Office Memorandum dated 04.07.2024
Daily microsighting guidelines have been revised. the Central Government
Revised Notice for implementation of wind power projects in the state vide Notification No. The date of 1
Guidelines on Microsighting issued by Government Decision on 25.08.2023
The government was considering revising the instructions.
Government Corrigendum: -
Reference No. 1 in the Government Decision at Paragraph No. The number in 1, , " / and 7 as follows:

Developer(s) shall maintain a wake loss (in terms of energy) of 10% between wind turbines with appropriate offset for wind turbines sited on a foot print basis.                            | excluded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Explanation: -
a) Revised projects registered as per Government Decision dated 25.08.2023
If the concerned developer is willing to set up the project as per the instructions
The developers concerned should be given the go-ahead. Submitting an application for re-registration
will be required. However, such projects have paid a registration fee for previous registrations.
If so, they will not be charged a new registration fee.
b) Revise pending projects for registration as per Government Decision, dated 25.08.2023
Application for re-registration will be required as per the instructions. However, such projects have been
If they have paid the registration fee for the registration, they have to pay the re-registration fee.
There will be no delay.
