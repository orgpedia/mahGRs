Introduction: As per the decision of the Department of Industry, Energy and Labor dated 11.10.2012, the state government provides concession in electricity rates to agricultural consumers. The limit of subsidy given by the government per unit to reimburse the expenditure incurred on it was retained. Accordingly, the increase in electricity tariff after August 2012 is to be borne by the agricultural pump owners. As a result, consumers are being burdened with higher electricity bills.
Since August 2012, the government has been providing a subsidy of Rs. 2.16 per unit to MSEDCL for providing electricity tariff concession to the High Pressure Abatement Irrigation Scheme consumers.
The Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) has issued new electricity tariff orders for the consumers of MSEDCL in June 2015, November 2016, April 2017, April 2018 and September 2018. As per the order, the power tariff of the consumers of High Pressure Irrigation Scheme has been increased. As per the Electricity Tariff Order dated 26.06.2015, the electricity tariff payable by the High Pressure Irrigation consumers was Rs. 1.16 per unit. There was a demand from the High Pressure Irrigation Cooperative Societies of the state to pay electricity dues from November 2016 to March 2020 at the same rate. A proposal in this regard was presented in the Cabinet meeting dated 29.01.2019. The government has taken the decision in line with the cabinet's decision.
Government's decision
High pressure lift irrigation schemes in the State are being approved to continue with concessional power tariff of Rs. 1.16 per unit from 1st November, 2016 to March, 2020. Accordingly, the Government has approved to provide financial assistance to MSEDCL to the tune of Rs. 107.73 crore.
After March, 2020, this concession will be reviewed by the Department of Energy.
