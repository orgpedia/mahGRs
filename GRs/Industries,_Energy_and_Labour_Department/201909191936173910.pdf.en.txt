The Proposal:
The total geographical area of Gadchiroli district is 14,412 sq km. About 78% of the geographical area of Gadchiroli district is covered by dense forest. in the district
The villages are remote and sparsely populated. As a result, the power supply to villages in remote and tribal areas has gone through the forest. In natural conditions like wind, storm, wind and rain, trees and branches in the forest fall on the power lines, due to which the power lines in the forest are frequently broken and the repair and restoration of the power supply is delayed. As a result, power supply to most of the tribal habitations in the district is frequently disrupted, making it difficult for the people of these areas to get regular and uninterrupted power supply. In order to provide uninterrupted and regular power supply to the end consumer, the length of the power lines should be reduced to reduce the additional load on them. A new 33/11 KV power sub-station needs to be constructed at Aheri.
Considering the current load on the existing sub-stations in Gadchiroli district and the voltage regulation of more than 12% on the high pressure channels emanating from these sub-stations, there is a need to set up a new sub-station in the district with a view to supply power to the power consumers in the tribal areas of Gadchiroli district with proper pressure.
