Reference:- State Election Commission, Maharashtra No. RANIA/ NAP-2019/ Q. No.6/ Q. Letter dated December 6, 2019.
Our country has adopted a democratic system and all registered people above the age of 18 are expected to cast 100 per cent votes in every election. In view of this, as per Section 135B of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, on the day of poll, the electors are generally given a paid holiday or, in some cases, a reasonable relaxation in working hours to enable them to exercise their franchise. However, in the last few elections, it has been observed that institutions/ establishments etc. do not provide paid holidays or concessions. This deprives many voters of their right to vote, which is very dangerous for democracy.
As per the order of the State Election Commission. The general/ by-election will be held on 29th December, 2019 as mentioned in Annexure-I. In order to enable all voters to exercise their right to vote in this election, the following orders are being issued: Workers/ officers/ employees who are voters in the polling area where the election is to be held, shall be given leave to exercise their franchise on the day of election even if they are working outside the area where the election is to be held for the purpose of work.
(ii) This holiday will be applicable to all establishments, factories, shops etc. under the Department of Industries, Energy and Labour (e.g. (iii) In exceptional circumstances, where it is not possible to grant full day leave to workers, officers, employees etc., workers in the polling area may be given a relaxation of at least two hours in lieu of leave to exercise their franchise. However, prior permission of the District Collector and the District Election Officer will be required for the same. In any case, the owners of the establishment concerned will have to ensure that the voters get at least two hours of relaxation for voting.
(iv) The above instructions shall be strictly complied with by the owners/ managements of all establishments, factories, shops etc. under the Industries, Power and Labour Department as mentioned above.
