Introduction: Fossil fuels are an integral part of the fuel sector in the country and there are limitations in the use of fossil fuels as they are limited, polluting and non-renewable. There is a need to reduce dependence on fossil fuel based fuels to reduce the cost of foreign exchange as well as to promote the production of environment friendly fuels. About 77% of the country's crude oil needs and about 50% of its natural gas needs are imported. The Government of India has focused on reducing the current consumption of fossil fuels and has adopted import substitution by reducing dependence on imports. The government has set a target to reduce the country's carbon footprint by 30-35% by 2023.
The National Policy on Biofuels, 2018 has set a target of 20% blending of ethanol with petrol and 5% blending of bio-diesel with diesel by 2030. Subsequently, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) in its meeting dated 21/12/2020 has decided to achieve the above targets by 2025.
3. For this purpose, a Committee under the Chairmanship of Special Secretary, NITI Aayog has recommended tax incentives in the form of tax rebates at the retail level to increase the use of ethanol blended fuel and tax incentives for vehicles that can use ethanol blended fuel.
The committee has also recommended that the government should encourage the use of less water-intensive grains such as maize and 27 feedstocks for the production of ethanol. At present, 9 per cent of ethanol is being blended in petrol in the state and there is a huge scope for the state to achieve the national target of 20 per cent by 2025. There is an urgent need to promote production of Compressed Bio-Gas (CBG) in the State from the feedstock available in the State such as biomass, plant sugars, urban solid waste, animal waste, and other crops produced from the agricultural sector. Considering these issues, the government was considering the formation of a committee to formulate a comprehensive biofuel production policy of the state.
