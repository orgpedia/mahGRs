Preamble: - Maharashtra is a leading state in India's progress and is a major deciding force in the economic outlook of the country. Maharashtra's share of the national gross domestic product (GDP) exceeds 13.6% and the state is set to become a trillion-dollar economy by 2030. Maharashtra's industrial sector accounts for 25 per cent of the state's GDP in the financial years 2023-2024, while the service sector accounts for 64 per cent. The state's strategic emphasis on advanced manufacturing, green technologies, and sustainable practices reflects the state's commitment to industrial innovation. Maharashtra has the highest share of foreign direct investment (FDI) in the country at around 39 per cent in FY 2024-25, reflecting the dynamic and investor-friendly economic situation of Maharashtra, which has been strengthened by strategic policies promoting industrial development and innovation. Infrastructure development is a major enabler of Maharashtra's economic success.
The state's service sector is a source of economic stimulus. Major sub-sectors, such as trade, hotels, transport, communication and services related to broadcasting, which have contributed significantly to the growth of the services sector, have shown strong performance. The dominance of the service sector in Maharashtra's economy highlights the state's urban and industrial character. Mumbai and Pune serve as major service centres and the positive results are reaching tier-2 and tier-3 cities in the state.
The Maharashtra Economic Advisory Council (MEAC) has presented an ambitious roadmap to make the state a trillion-dollar economy. The council considers the manufacturing sector to be the decisive driver of the floods, and aims to significantly increase its share of the state's gross domestic product by expanding existing industries and attracting new ones to select key sectors. The Industrial Policy-2019 has played a significant role in Maharashtra maintaining a leading position in attracting industrial investment by creating a conducive business environment, promoting micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), and promoting inclusive, regionally balanced, and environmentally sustainable development. Recognizing the rapidly evolving global economic scenario and technological advancements, a new Industry, Investment and Services Policy has been formulated to enable the state to address these challenges, emphasise its existing strengths, and introduce innovative solutions while maintaining Maharashtra's competitiveness in the global market.
Maharashtra's new Industry, Investment and Services Policy marks a turning point for the next decade.
The policy aims to position Maharashtra as a major global business destination, attracting substantial investment, fostering innovation, and increasing technology adoption. The policy mainly includes promoting advanced manufacturing technologies, enhancing infrastructure development, promoting sustainable and green manufacturing practices, and strengthening the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector. The policy will provide state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities to the state by enhancing ease of doing business, strengthening the single window system, and creating a conducive regulatory environment.
