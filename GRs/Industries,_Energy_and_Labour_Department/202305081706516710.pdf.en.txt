SOUREP-2022/ PR No.155/ URJYA-7 dated 2.11.22
The Proposal:
There are about 45 lakh agricultural electricity consumers in the state of Maharashtra. Maharashtra is the largest producer of electricity in the country. Agriculture accounts for about 22% of the total energy consumption in the state and is mainly used to power agricultural pumps. At present, electricity is supplied to farmers in a cyclic manner during day and night. Due to such power supply, farmers face a lot of inconvenience, while irrigating the fields at night, wild animals, snake bites, etc., there is a constant demand from the farmers to supply power during the day to solve these problems.
With a view to provide affordable and convenient power supply to the farmers of the state, the" Mukhyamantri Saur Krishi Vahini Yojana" was launched under the government decision dated June 14, 2017, to electrify the agricultural power line through solar energy in the villages where the agricultural power line was disconnected. Considering the difficulties in implementation of the scheme, it has been amended vide Government Resolution dated 17.03.2018.
Subsequently, the revised policy on land required for solar power projects under the Mukhya Mantri Solar Krishi Vahini Yojana has been announced under the Government decision dated November 2, 2022.
3. Detailed discussions were held with solar project developers and review of installed solar projects in line with Mukhya Mantri Solar Krishi Vahini Yojana. It has identified the following major challenges in the speedy and effective implementation of the Mukhyamantri Solar Krishi Vahini Yojana:

Government Resolution No: SOURP-2023/ P.No. 95/ Energy-7
1) Technical Challenges Grid connectivity is one of the important challenges for project developers to set up a project.
Inadequate availability of grid on the channel, deficiencies in the plant and lack of necessary maintenance, unbalanced power load, etc., are some of the factors that make it difficult to develop solar projects.
2) Economic Challenges The cost of the projects depends on the type of land, location, evacuation arrangements, local support, location of power sub-station, unnecessary delay in project completion period, increase in additional cost, not being able to estimate the cost accurately initially due to relatively small size (capacity) of the project, high cost in certain situations especially in the initial years, etc. As a result, the developer faces financial difficulties in completing the project.
3) Operational Challenges Availability of land near power sub-stations is a key requirement for solar power projects under Mukhya Mantri Solar Krishi Vahini Yojana. The delay in completion of the project is due to the permissions, approvals, project registration procedures required at various levels for the land to be available.
Implementation regarding Non-agriculture permission and exemption from tax by Revenue/ Local Bodies Not to require non-agriculture (NA) of land required for setting up of the project, exempting these lands from all taxes/ fees levied by Revenue and Local Bodies, despite the provisions contained in the relevant Government decisions dated 14.06.2017 and 30.06.2022, these provisions are not being strictly implemented by the concerned agencies. Developers are facing a lot of difficulties.
4. Given the experience and challenges of implementation of Mukhyamantri Saur Krishi Vahini Yojana, there is a need to implement this scheme on mission mode for rapid solarization of agricultural power lines under Mukhyamantri Solar Krishi Vahini Yojana. In this regard, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed on 27 th December, 2022 between Government of Maharashtra (Department of Power) and Prayas Sanstha (Energy Group) for planning and formulation of Mission-2025 with technical and informational support. A study group of representatives of the General Administration, MSEDCL, MSEDCL and PwC institutions will also be formed to determine the revised format of the Mukhyamantri Solar Krishi Vahini Yojana. It was headed by the Principal Secretary (Energy). Considering the recommendations of the study group and the report of Prayas Institute on Mission 2025, the government was considering to implement the scheme in mission mode by amending the existing Mukhyamantri Solar Krishi Vahini Yojana.

Government's decision:
With a view to make solar energy of agricultural feeders in mission mode to supply power to farmers' agricultural pumps during the day, the Government has approved the Mukhyamantri Saur Krishi Vahini Yojana 20" Mission to provide uninterrupted and sustainable power supply to farmers' agricultural pumps during the day" as follows:
1) The objectives of the program:
Under the Mission, the objectives of the Mission are being approved to further strengthen and streamline the Mukhyamantri Saur Krishi Vahini Yojana, to prepare the necessary technical, financial, procedural and monitoring framework for solarization of at least 30% of agricultural power lines in the State by 2025, and to create at least 7000 MW solar power capacity to provide uninterrupted and sustainable power supply to farmers during the day.
Implementing Systems and Components:
The Maharashtra State Electricity Board will be the nodal agency for the project. The scheme will be implemented through a mechanism to be nominated by the government. Till then, the MSEDCL will be responsible for the implementation. The government is planning to set up a separate company to supply electricity to the agriculture sector in the future. After that, the project will be implemented.
Under the Mission, solar power projects will be set up in the following manner: (2.1) Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with selected developers on Tariff Based Bidding basis and Power Sale Agreements (PSAs) with MSEs through open tenders by Nodal Agency/ MSEDCL or nominated mechanism. (2.2) Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with selected developers on Tariff Based Bidding basis and Power Sale Agreements (PSAs) with MSEs through open tenders by the company/ nodal agency after setting up of Agri Power Company in future. (2.3) Land Permits for the project by forming Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) wherever feasible. The selected bidders through Tariff Based Bidding will acquire the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) and enter into a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with MSEDCL for the project on Krishi Vahini which is not included in any project group after implementation of 2.4. The plants will be set up as per requirement on Feed in Tariff basis and EPC basis subject to approval of Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission.
