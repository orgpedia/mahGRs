Reference:- Letter from MSEDCL No.M.A. (Distribution)/ GRAVI-1/ HVDS/ 681 dated 09.01.2018
The Proposal:
District wise review meeting held on 12.12.2017 in the winter session of the Legislature at Nagpur under the chairmanship of Hon'ble Chief Minister. The Chief Minister had given instructions to implement a high pressure distribution system for agricultural pump consumers in the state. It had also directed that the proposal for the high-pressure system be submitted to the Cabinet for approval. Accordingly, MSEDCL has submitted a proposal to the Government under the above mentioned letter to supply power through high pressure system to 2,24,785 agriculture pumpsets in the State which are likely to be pending for payment by the end of March 2018.
At the end of March 2017, a total of 40,68,220 agricultural pump customers are being supplied electricity by MSEDCL in the state. These consumers have consumed a total of 28271.92 million units of electricity in 2016-17 (which is 28% of the total consumption by all categories of consumers). At the end of March 2018, 2,58,826 agricultural pumps are pending for payment of electricity connection.
As per the existing system, 63 KVA/ 100 KVA electric rooftops are installed to supply power to all these agricultural pump consumers and power is supplied to the agricultural pumps through the small pressure channel on that rooftop. About 15-20 agricultural consumers are supplied electricity from one Rohithra. Due to the increase in the length of the short-pressure line, the MSEDCL has to face problems such as low-pressure power supply to the consumers, frequent breakdowns in the power supply, increasing technical power loss, increasing the rate of rotary failure, electrical accidents, theft of power by hooking on the short-pressure line, etc. This makes it difficult to achieve the goal of uninterrupted and sustainable power supply. In order to solve this problem, MSEDCL has proposed to supply electricity to agricultural pumps in the state through High Pressure Distribution System (HVDS).
The implementation of this high pressure distribution system will result in reduction of low pressure distribution losses. Also, by putting a hook on the low pressure duct, the loss of electricity can be avoided and the rate of burning of the furnace will be reduced. Under this scheme, electricity will be supplied to one or two agricultural pumps on every Rohitra.

There will be a sense of ownership of Rohith among the consumers and hence there will be no unauthorised power connection from Rohith. This will greatly reduce the amount of waste. In High Pressure System (HVDS), since the power flow on the high pressure channels is greatly reduced and power cannot be stolen by putting figures on the high pressure channels, it will help in reducing the distribution losses. Also, it will be possible to supply electricity to agricultural consumers at the right pressure. Since the high pressure duct is controlled by a circuit breaker from the substation, the power supply will be shut down immediately if the power wire is broken and the potential electrical accident caused by the wire break will be reduced. Considering the above advantages, the matter of implementing the scheme in the state was under the consideration of the government as it would be economical to use the high-pressure distribution system for providing electricity connections to agricultural pumps henceforth. Give it to it. The proposal was presented in the cabinet meeting held on April 17, 2018. The government has taken the decision in line with the Cabinet decision.
Government's decision:
1. Approval is being given to implement High Pressure Distribution System (HVDS) scheme through MSEDCL for electrification of agricultural pumps pending for power connection in the state.
The estimated cost of the scheme is Rs. 4496.69 crore and the new sub-station is estimated to cost Rs. 551.44 crore. The total project cost is Rs. 5048.13 crore.
The pending agricultural pump power connection in Vidarbha and Marathwada will now be provided through High Pressure Distribution System (HVDS). 1954.09 crore for 2018-19 and 2019-20 under the scheme" Providing Electricity Connection to Agriculture Pumps in Vidarbha and Marathwada Region"
This year's budget has to be budgeted. It is also being approved to distribute this fund in the form of subsidy to MSEDCL.
4. Rs. 2542.59 crore for providing electricity connection through High Pressure Distribution System to the remaining agricultural pumps in Maharashtra (excluding Vidarbha and Marathwada)
MSEDCL is being allowed to raise loans through Borrowing. Also, the government should guarantee the setting up of these bonds and waive the guarantee fee on them.
Under this scheme, an estimated amount of Rs.294 crore for 121 new sub-stations in Vidarbha and Marathwada regions will be provided to MSEDCL for 2018-19 and 2019-20 under the scheme" Providing Electricity Connection to Agriculture Pumps in Vidarbha and Marathwada Regions."

should be done. Also, 105 new sub-stations in the rest of Maharashtra will cost around Rs. The fund of Rs 257 crore will be raised by MSEDCL through market borrowing.
As per the above decision, the MSEDCL should start implementing it immediately and submit a report to the government every two months.
7. This Government Decision, with the concurrence of the Finance Department and in its informal Reference No. 116/18/ Expenditure- 16D. Issued on 02.05.2018.
