The Proposal:
Recognizing the critical importance of generating electricity from new and renewable energy sources, the Government of India has announced a policy to generate 175 Gigawatts of electricity through such sources by 2022. This includes 100 GW of solar power generation. throughout the country and
The state has plans to generate electricity from new and renewable energy sources.
Under the 2015 policy, it was planned to develop 7,500 MW solar power generation plants in Maharashtra. Out of this, 2500 MW capacity solar power generation project was proposed to be developed by the State Generating Company on Public-Private Partnership mode to meet their upcoming Renewable Energy Obligation. The remaining 5000 MW of solar power generation is planned to be developed by other project developers. Under the policy, power from solar power projects to be developed under Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode will be used to meet the Renewable Energy Purchase Obligation (REPO) of the state's MSEDCL. The purchase rate of this electricity will be as per the preferential rate fixed by the Electricity Regulatory Commission. As per the decision of the Government in Reference No. 3, out of the target of 2500 MW of solar power given to the Mahanirmiti Company, 500 MW of power generated by developing projects on Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPC) basis will be purchased by MSEDCL.

3. In pursuance of the development of solar power projects as per the Non-Conventional Energy Policy of the State.
Under the Yavatmal project, administrative approval was sought for setting up of solar power projects of total 390 MW capacity of 75 MW capacity (25 MW at Mauje Mangaladevi, 25 MW at Mauje Pimpri Ijara and 25 MW at Mauje Malkhed) on EPC basis with the loan from KfW Bank, Germany and equity participation from Mahanirmiti. The government has taken the following decisions:
Government's decision:
The Government has accorded administrative approval for setting up solar power projects of 145 MW at Chandrapur and 75 MW (25 MW at Mauje Mangaladevi, 25 MW at Mauje Pimpri Ijara and 25 MW at Mauje Malkhed) under G. Yavatmal Project with a total installed capacity of 390 MW.
Letter of intent has been issued from time to time for availing fresh loans of KIW for solar power projects of 2. 390 MW capacity. As per the terms of the loan, KiW has made a preliminary proposal to the government for a new loan at a concessional rate of interest as compared to the interest rate on the old loan for solar power projects. As per the preliminary proposal of the new loan, the interest rate offered by KfW for the 390 MW solar power projects is 0.05% per annum as compared to the earlier project assistance contract provided by KfW at 1.96% per annum, which is beneficial.
For this 390 MW capacity, KIW has mandated 10% DRY CLEANING and 10% AGRIVOLTAIC modification in each plant capacity as per the condition of the innovative project, equivalent to 20% of each plant capacity. Out of which, the condition of 10% Agrivoltaic has been relaxed and it has been agreed to carry out dry cleaning of 10% of the total 390 MW project capacity. As per this innovative project condition, draft tenders and contracts for 390 MW capacity should not be prepared and not objected to.
