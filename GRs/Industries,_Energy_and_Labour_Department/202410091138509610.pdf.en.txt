Government Decision No: Matandho-2024 / Q.No.938 / Udyog-2
Mantralaya, Mumbai - 400 032.
Date: 9th October, 2024
Read: Government Decision No. Matandhu 2022 / Pt. No.170 / Industry-2, dated 27/06/2023
Introduction: - The "Integrated Data Centre Parks" area has been identified as a priority area (111151 9800) in the Maharashtra Industrial Policy-2019. The Integrated Data Centre Pak and Ghatak are directly supported and promoted by the state government under the Information Technology and IT-enabled Services Policy 2023.
The city of Mumbai has the highest number of seaplane stations in the country, connecting the Asia Pacific to the east-west of the world. It is the biggest link for global market expansion. The NITI Aayog has recently published a report on making the Mumbai metropolitan region a trillion-dollar economy in collaboration with the state government. It highlights that the Mumbai Metropolitan Region can be set up as an integrated data centre parks hub and also as a green data centre hub. Zone-1 (Mumbai and Navi Mumbai) is emerging as a data centre hub in Asia-Pacific due to sustainable power supply, undersea cable landing facilities, and availability of trained technical manpower. $1 trillion (591) to the state? The state has set up an Economic Advisory Council (EAC) (59) to prepare a detailed roadmap towards achieving the aspirational goals of the. The Economic Advisory Council has also mentioned data centres as an important area in their recommendation.
The country's economy is growing at over 7% and there is a significant market demand for data processing and storage. With the advent of artificial intelligence (51), the need for data storage and processing is going to increase manifold. But at the same time, there is a major concern of global warming due to the excessive use of energy by data centers. For this reason, many multi-national giants such as.
Amazon, Google, etc., have hinted at storing their data in a green integrated data center park. For this, the concept of "Green Integrated Data Centre Parks" is being proposed. Accordingly, companies will develop Tier 4 data centers for their own use and / or developers for other data center components, and various data center companies will use the data storage space, including the hardware, in the facility.
The state government is keen to promote data centres under the IT & ITeS Policy-2023 and intends to develop cities in Zone-19, particularly Mumbai and Navi Mumbai region as data centre hubs under the above policy. Various attractive incentives have been paid under the policy to maintain Mumbai / Navi Mumbai's leading position in India's total data centre capacity and to make Mumbai the 'Data Centre Capital of India'. In view of this fact, the IT & ITeS Policy 2023 has been partially revised.

This includes setting up of three (3) green integrated data centre parks to provide additional incentives to them.
is under consideration.
The Government's Decisions:
Integrated Data Center Parks is a priority area. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ The development of the region is critical to achieving the state's goal of a trillion-dollar economy, coupled with increasing industrialization.
However, due to the large amount of energy consumed by data centers, global warming is a major concern.
The concept of "Green Integrated Data Centre Parks" has been proposed. Green integrated data center
This is extremely rare as setting up of parks involves non-conventional energy generation, setting up of supply chains and other infrastructure etc. Incentives for data center parks and components have been implemented under the Information Technology and IT-enabled services policy 2023. All of these incentives will continue to apply to developers and components in the green integrated data centers offered.
In addition, additional incentives are being allowed to green integrated data center parks as mentioned further. Therefore, by partially amending the existing IT and ITeS Policy 2023, the following three (3) green integrated data centre parks will be defined, eligible, and
Terms, conditions, incentives and additional incentives are being permitted: -
The definition and eligibility of a green integrated data centre is as follows:
7 Definition of Green Integrated Data Centre Park: - "For the purpose of this policy, green integrated data
Centre Park is defined as an information technology infrastructure. Storing data that is high energy efficient and designed to reduce its environmental impact,
Hosts the server to manage and transmit. Eligible for incentives under this policy
This type of data center park will use 100% green energy for their original data center activities. This green data center is the seed use efficacy developed by Parks Green Grid.
(015) and carbon utilization effectiveness ('[17]) are two of the most efficient in terms of ARTA.
These data center buildings should be at least 1.71) silver grade. or green data.
Data that meet the eligibility of fixed capital investment for permissible incentives for centres and
Buildings, plants, and machinery / equipment used in this facility for its storage.
This will include investments.
e Definition of a Green Integrated Data Center Park: - "For the purpose of this policy, Green Integrated Data Center Park 1s defined as facility including IT infrastructure that hosts servers to store, manage and disseminate data that has been designed to be highly energy efficient and to minimize its environmental impact." Such type of Data Centre Parks shall use 100% Green Energy for its core Data Centre activities, to be eligible for the incentives under this policy. These Green Data Centre parks should be very efficient in terms of two metrics, namely Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) and Carbon Usage Effectiveness (CUE) developed by the Green Grid. It 1s expected that the buildings of these data centers should comply with the lowest LEED Silver Grades norms. Fixed capital investment eligible for incentives for these Green Data Centres will include investment in building, plant and machinery / equipment used in this facility for data and its storage. "

10. The Department of Industries is being permitted to sanction Green Integrated Data Centre Parks and pay the additional incentives sanctioned for the same from the funds received under the Community Incentive Scheme as per the extant procedure. The above incentives should be disbursed from the funds received under the head of accounts under the collective incentive scheme.
The scheme will automatically terminate once the first three (3) green integrated data centre projects are set up in the state.
