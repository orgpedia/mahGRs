The Proposal:
Office of the Secretary General on Wind Power Projects dated 29.12.2007
Micrositing guidelines were issued. After that, the microsite
The guidelines were revised on 16.02.2008 and 12.03.2013.
Against the second amendment made in the guidelines on Micrositing dated 12.03.2013, Mr. Public Interest Litigation in the High Court of Bombay No. 129/2013 has been filed. Sadar
In the case Guidelines on Micrositing issued by the Office of the Secretary General on 12.03.2013 vide Interim Order dated 09.07.2014 passed by the High Court, Bombay
The implementation of the recommendations has been put on hold. The Central Government has issued guidelines on wind power projects on 22.10.2016. Among these suggestions, No. 5
Micrositing is related to thematic guidelines. Public Interest Litigation No. 129/2013. the High Court vide its interim order dated 09.07.2014
The office of No. 3& 4 dated 22.10.2016 of the Central Government.
A proposal was submitted to the government to apply the guidelines on micrositing to wind power projects in the state. Central Government regarding Micrositing dated 22.10.2016
The guidelines are comprehensive and are conducive for the development of wind power projects.
Therefore, the matter of applying these guidelines to wind power projects in the state was under the consideration of the government.

Government's decision:
Central Government issued notification dated 22.10.2016 for development of Wind Power Projects
The guidelines No. 5 Guides to Micrositing as Mentioned Here
Instructions are being given to implement wind power projects in the state as usual.
Below are the guidelines for this microsite:
Micrositing:
Micrositing is the optimization of energy production through the correct placement of wind turbine generators in the wind farm area, considering all physical constraints of the area. The optimized location of wind turbine generators (WTGs) may be computed by running an appropriate wind flow modelling, optimisation tools (linear and Non-linear) and techniques in any terrain conditions. The criteria for Micrositing shall be based on an optimised output rather than a strict mandated minimum distance between wind turbines. Micrositing criteria are prescribed as under; i. Developer(s) shall optimise the wind turbine locations within their land using appropriate wind flow modelling and optimisation tools (linear and Non linear)/techniques subject to site assessment as per IEC 61400-1 standard for turbine safety considering extreme wind, flow inclination, vertical wind shear, and turbulence with added wake effects and corrections for terrain complexity etc.
ii. Developer(s) shall maintain a distance of 2 x D (D-Rotor Diameter) distance perpendicular to the predominant wind direction and 3 x D distance in the pre dominant wind direction from the boundary line of each adjoining land of other developer(s) with appropriate offset.
iii. Developer(s) shall maintain a wake loss (in terms of energy) of 10 % between
wind turbines with appropriate offset for wind turbines sited on a foot print basis.
iv. Developer(s) shall maintain a distance of HH+1/2RD+5m (Hub Height + Half
Rotor Diameter +5 meters) from Public Roads, railway tracks, highways, buildings, public institutions and EHV lines.
V. Developer(s) shall not site wind turbines within 500 m of any dwelling for the mitigation of noise.
The above mentioned Micro siting techniques will also assist in repowering & intercropping as the investors/developers will have no constraints with minimum distances within the available land ensuring optimised utilisation of the land with wind resource.
Maharashtra Energy Development is responsible for the implementation of these guidelines in the state.
The office will be the office of the General Manager.
