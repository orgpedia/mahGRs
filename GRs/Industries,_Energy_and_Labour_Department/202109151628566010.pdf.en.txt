Delivery was initially delayed. Due to GST regime and increase in prices of metals like Aluminium, Copper, Steel, etc. and budget estimates of MSEDCL for 2017-2018, bidders have not responded to the base price. Due to this, the dates for accepting bids were postponed 4 to 5 times in some districts. The scheme could not progress as the entire country was under lockdown from March, 2020 to September-October, 2020 due to outbreak of COVID-19. The cost of providing electricity connections in the rest of Maharashtra is to be borne by MSEDCL by raising loans from banks. During this process, the merger of the concerned banks as well as the lockdown due to Covid-19 led to a delay in the supply of loans. The scheme is proposed to be extended till March 2023.
Also, the number of beneficiaries from the SC and ST categories in Vidarbha and Marathwada regions was found to be actually less than the estimated beneficiaries, resulting in an increase in the number of beneficiaries from the general category. This led to an increase in subsidy by Rs. 780.73 crore. But before the actual implementation of the scheme, the number of beneficiaries in the rest of Maharashtra was reduced due to power connections from other schemes. 5048.13 crore to Rs. 4734.61 crore.
