Preamble: Under the Dynamic Power Development Reforms Programme (APDRP), the Central Government had agreed to provide funds under the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) from the Central Government in the form of grant-in-aid/ group loan for the modernization/ renovation of old power stations of Maharashtra State Electricity Board, strengthening of transmission and distribution networks, measurement of electricity, installation of electricity meters, etc. The State government had obtained loan from the Centre for the project.
Under the Dynamic Power Development Reform Programme (APDRP), the state government has received a loan from the central government and the repayment of this loan (principal+ interest) is being done by the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company.
The Government of Maharashtra had opened a separate new head of account for this loan for repayment of the loan (principal). However, no separate head of account was opened for repayment of interest.
Therefore, a proposal to open a new head of account for payment of interest under the Dynamic Power Development Reform Programme (APDRP) was under consideration of the Government.
Government's decision:
Under the Dynamic Power Development Reforms Programme (APDRP), new head of accounts are being opened for payment of interest.
