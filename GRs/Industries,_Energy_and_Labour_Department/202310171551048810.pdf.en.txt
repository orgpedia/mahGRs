Introduction: With increasing industrialization and urbanization, the demand for energy resources is continuously increasing. An important part of global carbon emissions is related to energy production and electricity consumption. Therefore, it is necessary to use renewable energy sources as an alternative to conventional energy sources. Considering the importance of renewable energy sources, the Union Government has set a target of generating 500 GW of electricity from renewable energy sources by 2030. The use of renewable energy sources is rapidly decarbonizing the power generation sector and the recent years of favourable policy support and cost reductions have led to an increase in renewable energy sources. The transition of heavy industries to low carbon sources is a necessity in the energy transition efforts. There is a need to adopt diversified resources that are environment friendly while meeting the requirement of primary fuel and raw materials for these industries.
Green hydrogen and its derivatives can meet the requirement as primary green fuel and feedstock in various industries. Green hydrogen is produced by hydrolysis using electricity generated by renewable energy sources. Green hydrogen will play a key role in the global energy transition to renewable energy and net zero emissions. At the global level, considering the demand and supply of energy, some countries have set ambitious targets for green hydrogen production and have started acting accordingly. India has the potential to become a global market for green hydrogen production due to domestic demand for green hydrogen and its expected future growth, huge potential for renewable energy, reducing dependence on fuel imports as well as the opportunity to create a green hydrogen production and export ecosystem.
The Prime Minister announced the" National Green Hydrogen Mission" on India's 75th Independence Day, laying the foundation for the development of India's green hydrogen ecosystem. Subsequently, the Ministry of Power, Government of India has notified the Green Hydrogen Policy Guidelines dated 17 th February, 2022, wherein, the cost of production of Green Hydrogen has been reduced to Rs.

Supply of hydrogen and Ease of Doing Business have been considered. Thereafter, the Central Government has notified the" National Green Hydrogen Mission" document (NGHM) dated 13.01.2023. Under the" National Green Hydrogen Mission," targets have been set to produce about 5 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of green hydrogen in the country by 2030 and to make India an export hub in green hydrogen and its derivatives.
ASPIRE is a joint technical assistance programme between the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy and the Ministry of Power. The programme is being implemented jointly by the Centre and the State government. The main theme of this technical assistance programme is" Green Hydrogen." Under this Joint Partnership Technical Assistance Programme, the Department has prepared a draft" Maharashtra Green Hydrogen Policy-2023." In pursuance of the said draft, a meeting was held on 24.02.2023 under the Chairmanship of Principal Secretary (Power) with all the concerned stakeholders. Accordingly, the draft policy. The presentation was made to the Deputy Chief Minister on 17.04.2023. The Government was contemplating to formulate" Maharashtra Green Hydrogen Policy-2023" to make the State a hub for green hydrogen and its derivatives and their applications, help open up new areas for green hydrogen use, promote technological advancements in the sector through R& D and technological partnerships and facilitate export of green fuel.
The state government has approved the Maharashtra Green Hydrogen Policy-2023.
