No.89/ Labour-5, Dt. 18.10.2017 Preamble- The Government vide Government Resolution No. Guidelines have been prescribed for the deduction of loans by the Board to the security guards registered with the Board of Security Guards under Sections 1 and 2, if they have to take loans from nationalized banks, cooperative banks and credit institutions, and if the security guards have to take loans from the amount deposited in their provident fund account other than the credit institution.
Similarly, No. As per the decision of the Government vide No. 3 of the Board, the amount of loan and interest on the last payable amount of retired and deceased security guards shall not be deducted from their gratuity and provident fund. Complaints have been received from various organisations regarding deduction of loan instalments from the salary of security guards.
Further, since the term security guarding boards are not covered under the term' employer' under Section 49 of the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960, such boards can deduct from the salary through the said financial institutions or how, similarly, the matter of deciding on the tripartite agreement of the security guard, credit bank/ bank, security guarding board while sanctioning the loan, and if the board does not fall under the term' employer', the board can be responsible for the liability of the loan if it is included in the agreement with the financial institution and the security guard. The views expressed by the Department of Law and Justice in this regard are as follows:
It is, thus, seen that employer in relation to security guards is the agency or agent when in its direct employment and deployed in a factory or establishment through the agency or agent. Principal employer is the person who has the ultimate control over the affairs of the factory or establishment. It is, thus, obvious that the Board does not fall within the ambit of term 'employer' or 'principal employer', as defined in the Act "

Government Resolution No: SGA-2016/ S.No.04/ Labour-5,
As per Section 49 of the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960, the employer shall, if so required by requisition in writing and on receipt of a copy of agreement executed in favour of the society by its member providing that his employer shall be competent to deduct form the salary or wages payable to him by the employer, such total amount payable to the society and in such instalments, as may be specified in the agreement, make the deduction in accordance with the agreement and pay the amount so deducted to the society. Considering the definitions of the term' employer' given in the Act, it cannot be said that the Board comes under the definition of the term' employer', as used in Section 49.
The Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act, 1960
In view of the provisions of the Government Reference No. Decisions are being taken to reduce the salary of government registered security guards by amending Government Decisions 1 and 2 as follows:
Government's decision:
Since the term security guard does not fall under the category of employer, it is not legal for the board to deduct the loan instalments of nationalised banks, co-operative banks and credit institutions from the salary of the security guard. The deduction of the amount borrowed by the Board from the salaries of the security guards through the said financial institutions does not fall within the provisions contained under Section 49 of the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960. As there is no such provision in any other rule, the deduction of the loan instalment of nationalized banks, cooperative banks and credit institutions from the salary of the security guard should not be done by the Security Guard Board.
