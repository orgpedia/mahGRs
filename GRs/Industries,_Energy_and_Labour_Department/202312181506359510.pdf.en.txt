Preamble: The Maharashtra Public Service Commission (MPSC) is conducting a two-year integrated probationary training programme for Group-A cadres through Yashoda, Pune and Group-B posts through Vanamati, Nagpur for direct recruitment every year from 2014 through State Service Examination. The decision is being implemented as per the government order. Accordingly, the cadre of Assistant Labour Commissioner (Group-A) and Government Labour Officer (Group-B) in the Labour Commissionerate under the Department of Industries, Energy and Labour will be included under reference No. Under the decision of the Government of 2, it has been approved to conduct a combined probationary training program. As per the order issued by the General Administration Department, the Group-B cadre officers selected by the Maharashtra Public Service Commission on the basis of the final result of the State Service (Main) Examination-2021 have been appointed as Trainee Officers and their training will be conducted under the Combined Peripheral Training Programme-9 (CPTP-9) at Vasantrao Naik State Agricultural Extension Management Training Institute (VANAMATI), Nagpur. has commenced from 03.10.2023 (BC). Instructions have been issued through the Reference No. 4 circular of the General Administration Department regarding the creation of a maximum number of posts within the limit of the number of candidates who appeared for this training. Accordingly, a number of additional posts have been created for these officers under the order of reference No. 5 of this department. In this government order, instructions have been given to pay the salary of the officers under the training from the title of the training. However, since the General Administration Department has directed to pay regular salary to the probation officers instead of wholesale salary, the regular salary is required to be paid from the head of salary account instead of the head of training account.
Therefore, the matter of amending the order at Reference No. 5 was under consideration of the Government.
