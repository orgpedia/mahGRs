To constitute a committee to study the technical aspects for achieving the objective of generating electricity through renewable energy sources.
The Government of Maharashtra
Department of Industry, Energy and Labour
Government Resolution No: Sankiran-2019/ P.S. No.137/ Energy-5
Madame Cama Road, Hutatma Rajguru Chowk, Mantralaya, Mumbai- 400 032.
Date is November 8, 2019.
The Proposal:
The government has set a target of generating 175 GW of renewable energy by 2022. Out of this, 100 GW will be solar power and 75 GW will be renewable energy.
The draft regulations of RPO Regulations, 2019 of the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) have proposed an RPO target of 25% for the year 2024-25, of which 13.5% is proposed to be generated by solar energy only. Solar power generation to be increased
In view of the objective, the State Transmission Board will study the potential high solar irradiance region of the State and remove the power generated by solar energy sources there.
Timely planning is required to be done in the system. In addition to the center
The government is working on developing a green energy corridor in the state.
Possible higher solar irradiance in the State towards achieving the above objective
Selecting the area and potential wind energy areas and developing transmission system in such areas.
The government had constituted a committee to look into the matter.
Government Resolution: The Chairman and members of the proposed committee are as follows:
Director (Commercial), Chairman, MSEDCL (2) Director (Projects), Member, DGMTC (3) Director (Projects), Member, General Transport Company (4) Additional Director General, MEDA (5) Chief Engineer (STU), General Transport Company: Member Secretary
