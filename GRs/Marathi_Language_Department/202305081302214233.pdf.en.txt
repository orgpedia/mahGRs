However, in view of the nature of the functioning of the field offices under this Department and the total number of posts in the said offices and the limited number of posts to be filled directly from the quota of nominations in the category of Group-B (Non-Gazetted), Group-C and Group-D within the purview of the Ex-Secondary Service Selection Board (outside the purview of the Maharashtra Public Service Commission), it would not be feasible to constitute a separate selection committee for each office. Therefore, a single state level for the government offices under this department
A selection committee was formed. Accordingly, the government was considering the formation of a single state-level selection committee for three government offices under the Directorate of Languages, Mumbai, Maharashtra State Marathi Encyclopedia Production Board, Mumbai and Maharashtra State Literary and Cultural Board, Mumbai.
