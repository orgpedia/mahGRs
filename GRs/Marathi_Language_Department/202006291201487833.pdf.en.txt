are frequently encountered. In view of all these complaints, the state cabinet in its meeting has directed to" restore the instructions given from time to time at the government level regarding the use of Marathi language in government affairs to all departments and to instruct disciplinary action against the concerned officers who do not follow these instructions." Accordingly, the proposal to bring these provisions again to the notice of all departments was under the consideration of the government.
Official Languages Act, 1964 and the Maharashtra Official Languages (Amendment) Act, 2015 and the Maharashtra Official Languages (Prohibited Purposes) Rules, 1966. " As per the April 30, 1966, all correspondence and other official business with the general public, except for"" prohibited purposes,"" is to be done entirely in Marathi language by the ministerial departments and the divisional offices under their control and all offices of the state government." In this regard, the relevant government decisions and circulars have been issued from time to time. Accordingly, the government's policy on the use of Marathi language in administrative work must be implemented voluntarily by all departments and offices under the state government. For this, every department must mention the use of Marathi language while making rules regarding the work of their department.
Reference No. 2. 9 here. In the circular dated 07.05.2018, comprehensive detailed instructions have been given for 100% use of Marathi language in administrative work.
However, some government decisions, websites, correspondence, letter initials, etc. are still available in English. Therefore, the use of Marathi language by the officers and employees in your office as well as in all the offices under your control. All the Heads of Departments and Heads of Offices are being again instructed to take necessary measures with due care to strictly implement the instructions in the circular dated 07.05.2018. Also, this notice should also be given to all the offices under the control of your department. If the instructions to be given to the citizens regarding the measures to be taken regarding natural disasters and information in all other areas are given in Marathi, the local people will understand the information well and the instructions will be followed by them properly.
Comments, Government decisions/ circulars are prepared in English language by certain departments at the Ministerial level. This has been brought to the notice of the concerned departments. It has also been noticed that the websites of some departments and their subordinate offices are only in English.
It has been pointed out by the representatives in the House that the transactions of applications/ samples/ notices/ letters etc. are still being done in English by many Municipal Corporations. Therefore, all the Metropolitan Municipal Corporations/ Municipal Councils should translate the frequently required samples of certificates/ notices, penal invoices in Marathi language from the Directorate of Language and use it on priority.

Strict instructions should be given to the concerned by the Urban Development Department. Guidelines, advertisements and slogans of central government schemes are printed by many departments in English or Hindi as prescribed by the central government.
