The following instructions should be strictly followed for the immediate and effective implementation of the transfer order.
On receipt of transfer orders, all the Heads of Offices shall relieve the transferred officers till 31st May, 2019 (Monday) without waiting for the replacement officers to appear.
2.The transferred officers should be reinstated without delay after they are relieved from their respective offices and join. The head of the office and the establishment officer concerned will be held responsible if there is a case of non-payment of salary and allowances due to non-recruitment of an officer without fixing a mandatory waiting period.
(3) The officers being posted under the said order shall be required to join immediately at the place of their posting. If any officer fails to appear at the place of posting or tries to directly or indirectly pressurize the officer to change the transfer order, it should be recorded in the confidential report of the concerned officer. Such officers will be liable for disciplinary action as the act violates Rule 3 (3) and Rule 23 of the Maharashtra Civil Services (Conduct) Rules, 1979.
Since these transfers are required to be effected effectively, the salary of all the transferred officers up to 31st May, 2019 shall be drawn by the office in which they are presently working.
Salaries due from June 1, 2019 should not be withdrawn from the pre-transfer office under any circumstances. After the concerned officer appears in the office of the transferor, the transfer will take place.
