Government Resolution No: Jajmi 2019/ PR No. 138/ Papu-10 (07), Dy. The September 4, 2020
The Proposal:
At present, the Jal Jeevan Mission programme is being implemented in the state under the joint auspices of the Central Government and the State Government for the period 2020-2024. Under this programme, water is supplied through individual functional tap connections to all households in rural areas with the objective of" Har Ghar Nal Se Jal." As per the objectives of the programme, works of tap water supply scheme have been taken up or proposed in rural areas of the State. However, since many villages/ hamlets, remote hilly areas, tribal areas in the State are water stressed areas during summer, there is a need for alternate solution schemes to supply water through functional household tap connections in these villages.
The Shiv Kalan water storage scheme was implemented in the state from 2002 to 2009. Under this scheme, schemes for rainwater harvesting and source strengthening were taken up in villages facing drinking water problems during summer.
The summer drinking water problems of many villages have been successfully solved through the measures undertaken under this scheme. On the same lines, the central government has encouraged other states to take up resource strengthening schemes.
About 42.5 per cent of the state's area (173 talukas) is prone to erosion due to the state's unique topography and large variations in precipitation. Geology, geographical conditions and sources of surface water in rural areas

About more than 80% of the schemes are based on groundwater recharge every year. Groundwater availability is also seasonal (rainy and winter) in many areas due to the geologic structure. This creates drinking water stress in many villages of the state and many villages and hamlets face the problem of availability of drinking water during such periods and lean periods. Temporary water supply is provided to such villages through supplementary measures. However, this does not serve the purpose of sustainable water supply nor does it provide regular drinking water to the rural population in water stressed areas. About 70% of the total rainwater in the state is discharged through surface run-off and evaporation. There is a need to use this flowing water on the principle of" Catch the Rain" to solve the problem of villages having drinking water stress in summer.
A Committee was constituted under the Chairmanship of Director, Ground Water Survey and Development Agency to formulate a strategy for implementation of remedial measures like storage tanks for drinking water storage in such villages/ wadis/ hamlets where drinking water is a problem for about 3 months in summer and due to specific geographical conditions. According to the report of the committee, it has been recommended to take measures like the Shivakal Water Storage Scheme implemented earlier in the state as well as the Jalshwarajya-2 program to provide drinking water to water-stressed villages/ hamlets in the summer. As per the report of the Committee, under the Jal Jeevan Mission programme, it is proposed to revamp the Shivakali Water Storage Scheme by taking up schemes of rainwater harvesting, storage tanks and source strengthening schemes to provide potable water in summer to villages facing water stress during summer and small villages and hamlets having seasonal ground water availability. Separate guidelines will be issued for the measures to be taken to strengthen these sources. It was under the consideration of the government to approve the implementation of storage tank measures for rainwater harvesting for villages and villages experiencing water stress in summer and to publish guidelines for implementation.
Government's decision:
To take measures under the Jal Jeevan Mission programme to provide drinking water during the stress period by storing water for the villages/ hamlets of the state which are experiencing water stress during 3 to 4 months of summer and certain periods due to other reasons.

The government is giving approval to implement a comprehensive scheme named' Storage Scheme'. The guidelines of the scheme are as follows:
The schemes proposed under Late Meenatai Thackeray Rural Water Storage Scheme are mainly for the period of actual water stress.
These measures should be taken as a complement to the original plan.
It will be necessary to take rainwater, springs, pazars, etc. as sources for the schemes. There should not be any water-based schemes.
If a ground water based scheme is required in areas with average or less permeability, it should be provided that the storage tank is filled from the water draining from the public well in the stream or river bank during the monsoon or the corresponding period.
Awareness and capacity building of the villagers for the use of stored water for drinking should be done on a large scale and continuously.
These schemes should be taken up mainly for villages in remote areas, hilly areas, tribal areas as well as in areas with DPAP and water stress.
Measures to be taken under Late Meenatai Thackeray Rural Water Storage Scheme-
1) Metallic storage.
2. Ferrocement or RCC cement storage tanks.
3) Water storage tanks.
4) Rain water/ spring based storage pond (under water).
5) Small tanks of ferrocement (stubble wells).
6) Closed underground storage tank.
The measures indicated in Annexure 1 to 4 above should be taken for villages/ hamlets/ hamlets with a population of at least 50 to a maximum of 500. In villages/ wards/ hamlets with a population of 50, the measures mentioned in A.No. 5 and 6. The capacity of the water tank to be taken up should be based on the population of the village/ wadi/ habitation concerned.
Clean and hygienic water, easily available during monsoon, can be stored in community storage tanks/ water hyacinths till summer, through daily distribution tanks or directly connected to existing distribution system, disinfected, during periods of water stress.

It should be made available to the public. The details of the schemes for undertaking such schemes are given in separate Annexures (Annexure 1, 2, 3 and 4).
If there is a need to build a storage pond according to the needs of a water-stressed village, then a storage pond of the appropriate size should be taken and water should be stored in it from a source such as rainwater or spring. Such ponds should be covered with food grade polyethylene paper. Separate guidelines will be issued for the implementation of the schemes in this regard.
Criteria for selection of villages under Late Meenatai Thackeray Rural Water Storage Scheme-
1) Villages/ Wards/ habitations where water is supplied through tankers certified by the Tahsildar.
(ii) Villages or hamlets jointly certified by the Geologist and Block Development Officer of the Zilla Parishad, which are geographically hilly/ remote/ inaccessible.
3) Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP) villages in the taluk.

The schemes proposed under this initiative will be implemented by the above competent authority as per the guidelines of Jal Jeevan Mission.
A complete block-wise list of eligible villages/ wadis/ hamlets, tandas, etc. should be prepared to implement these measures. It should be approved by the Village Water Supply and Sanitation Committee. Thereafter, the list of selected villages should be approved by the District Committee headed by the Collector and the Guardian Minister. These villages should be included in the annual action plan. If it is very necessary to implement these measures, the measures should be taken with the approval of the District Committee headed by the Collector.
Further approval of the committee headed by the Chief Minister should be taken after this.
2. Preference should be given to rainwater, springs, pazhars etc. as sources for water for schemes. If a ground water based scheme is required in areas with average or lower permeability, arrangements should be made to fill the storage tank from a public well on the stream or river bank during the monsoon season or from an adjacent period.
(iii) Regular water quality testing of the sources under the scheme, including ground water based sources, should be done before and after the implementation of the scheme. All plans must be fully insured.
4. Since the objective of Jal Jeevan programme is Har Ghar Nal Se Jal, it is expected to provide household tap connections. For this, the schemes for distribution of water from the storage tanks/ water bodies should be connected to the existing distribution system or the daily distribution tanks should be connected to the distribution system and water should be distributed through them in summer. If necessary, additional distribution arrangements should be included in this scheme.
There are limits on the amount of water stored through these schemes, so care should be taken to ensure that there is no leakage of water anywhere in the distribution system. All the water connections in the village should be restored. A regular system of water release and shut down etc. should be created in these villages/ wells as per requirement.

The villagers should be made aware of the water lock, the use of stored water sparingly, and the care to be taken to avoid wastage of water.
6. Type estimates for metallic tank system schemes are given in Annexure V. DSR from Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran should be used to prepare the budget of the schemes.
After administrative approval, the schemes should be implemented as per the guidelines of Jal Jeevan Mission. The implementation period of the scheme should be given from 4 to 6 months depending on the local situation.
8. The action plan to be taken in accordance with this initiative shall be at least Rs. This capacity should be built per person per day. However, in these villages, the existing schemes, schemes for strengthening ground water, schemes for strengthening sources, water management, etc. Be sure to meet this goal every day.
9. If the scheme requires installation of pumps, solar-based pumps should be included on priority.
Water quality check
If there is a spring or groundwater source, the water quality should be regularly checked before and after the source is selected. The quality of water should be checked regularly before distribution. As per the existing practice, the Gram Panchayat will be responsible for delivering water samples to the sub-divisional laboratory for water quality testing through water safeguards. The sub-divisional laboratories should provide water quality reports to the gram panchayat free of cost by conducting regular inspections.
Maintenance of schemes-
The Gram Panchayat concerned will be responsible for the proper continuation of the schemes implemented under the Late Meenatai Thackeray Rural Water Storage Program, regular filling of the storage tank, using the available water in a planned manner and maintaining and repairing the schemes.
Even though the maintenance repair cost for the scheme is expected to be less, provision for water table recovery for maintenance repair of the scheme should be made as per prevailing rates. Plan maintenance

Government Resolution No: GRAPADHO-2021/ PR No.17/ PAPU-07
Capacity building of water and sanitation committees or water protectors should be done at the local level.
Regular review should be done at the taluk level about whether the schemes implemented are running properly or not, regular filling of storage tanks, planned use of available water and maintenance of the schemes. For this, the Block Development Officer of the concerned Taluka and the Deputy Director of the Sub-Divisional Office will be responsible for monitoring, reviewing and providing necessary guidance to the Gram Panchayats.
capacity building and public awareness
Before taking up the remedial measures under the Late Meenatai Thackeray Rural Water Storage Programme, awareness should be created about the water balance in the village, strengthening of sources, measures to be taken to reduce the pressure on groundwater, the use of stored water and its use in a strict and planned manner.
In the villages taken up and implemented under this initiative, there is a need for continuous public awareness and capacity building of the villagers, members of the Water and Sanitation Committee as well as the concerned water conservator or water supply staff for maintenance and repair of the scheme, proper operation of the scheme, regular filling of the storage tank, planned use of available water, disinfection of the water being distributed. For this, the Deputy Executive Officer (Water and Sanitation) should take action through the District Water and Sanitation Mission Cell. It will be the responsibility of the implementing agency to train at least 2 to 3 persons from the village concerned for the maintenance of these measures as well as the repair at the local level.
Funding for the implementation of the program
The cost of implementation of the schemes proposed under the Late Meenatai Thackeray Rural Water Storage Scheme should be met from the funds made available to the Zilla Parishads at the state level under the Jal Jeevan Mission programme.
Apart from the Jal Jeevan Mission programme, the funds available with the District Planning Committee, the Finance Commission, the funds available under Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) or other funds, if available, should also be used to implement these schemes.
