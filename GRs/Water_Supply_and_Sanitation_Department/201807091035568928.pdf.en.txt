The Proposal:
Water supply schemes are being implemented under various programmes (National Rural Drinking Water Programme, Chief Minister's Rural Drinking Water Programme, Jalaswarajya Phase-II etc.) to solve the drinking water problem in rural areas of the State. Before preparing the detailed project report of the water supply scheme, a resolution is taken by the concerned Gram Panchayat/ Gram Sabha regarding the demand for the scheme and the water table ready to be filled. However, most of the time, the villagers do not have adequate knowledge of the scheme and after the implementation of the water supply scheme, the beneficiary in the village refuses to take the tap connection and meter connection. Also, those who have taken the tap connection are being prevented from filling the water table. Thus, it is not possible to meet the cost of maintenance and repair of the schemes, otherwise the schemes are closed due to lack of maintenance and the capital expenditure incurred on the scheme is wasted as the original purpose of supplying drinking water fails. For this, the government was considering issuing guidelines for providing a laminated copy to each family by taking personal guarantee from the house owners of the village regarding water tap and meter connection before the implementation of water supply schemes so that all the villagers have adequate participation in the implementation of the water supply scheme.
