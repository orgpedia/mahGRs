Government Order No: APNA-0219/ PR No.16/ PAPU-15
The following instructions should be strictly followed for the immediate and effective implementation of the transfer order:
On receipt of transfer orders, all the Heads of Offices shall relieve the transferred officers till 31st May, 2019 (Monday) without waiting for the replacement officers to appear.
2.The transferred officers should be reinstated without delay after they are relieved from their respective offices and join. The head of the office and the establishment officer concerned will be held responsible if there is a case of non-payment of salary and allowances due to non-recruitment of an officer without fixing a mandatory waiting period.
(3) The officers being posted under the said order shall be required to join immediately at the place of their posting. If any officer fails to appear at the place of posting or tries to directly or indirectly pressurize the transfer order, it should be recorded in the confidential report of the concerned officer. Such officers will be liable for disciplinary action as the act violates Rule 3 (3) and Rule 23 of the Maharashtra Civil Services (Conduct) Rules, 1979.
Since these transfers are required to be effected effectively, the salary of all the transferred officers up to 31st May, 2019 shall be drawn by the office in which they are presently working. Salaries due from 01.06.2019 should not be withdrawn from the pre-transfer office under any circumstances. After the concerned officer arrives at the transfer office, the post-transfer office should deduct the salary and submit a report to the government. Instructions are being issued to all the Heads of Departments and Heads of Offices in the Ground Water Survey and Development System that they will be held personally liable if the salary due from 01.06.2019 is paid by the Drawing and Disbursing Officer of the office in which they were working before the transfer.
It may be noted that if the transferred officers are not relieved by 31/05/2019 (M.N.), action will be taken to relieve the concerned officers unilaterally by the Water Supply and Sanitation Department.
