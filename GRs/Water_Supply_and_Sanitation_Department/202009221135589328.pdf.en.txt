Government Circular: Every year in the state, due to insufficient rainfall or other reasons, there is a shortage of drinking water in rural/ urban areas. In order to avoid any confusion regarding the applications to be taken for drinking water shortage, this Department has issued Reference No. Standing Orders have been issued under Government Decisions 1, 2 and 3. According to the standing orders, the measures taken to address water scarcity will be implemented till June 30. this year in the state.

Although some areas have received good rainfall, some areas have received less than normal rainfall. Considering the possibility of drinking water shortage in such areas in the coming summer, it is necessary to start action immediately in accordance with the instructions in the standing order under the government. The following recommendations are made:
(1) not to permit the digging of any wells for purposes other than the purpose of drinking water within a distance of 500 metres of the sources as per section 21 in the area of influence of public drinking water sources notified under section 20 of the Maharashtra Ground Water (Development and Management) Act, 2009, as well as prohibiting the extraction of ground water from such wells for a reasonable period of time by order of the District Authority if the groundwater depletion in the existing wells in the area of influence is found to be adversely affecting any public drinking water sources as per section 22.
(ii) Urgently take necessary action to take appropriate measures at the proposed minimum cost to mitigate water scarcity in the villages/ hamlets and urban areas as per the local conditions and sources as required.
3) Reference No. 2 As per the decision of the government here, instructions have been prepared to implement preventive measures at the village level to prevent water scarcity in the state. Accordingly, a program should be launched to implement various measures for water conservation and strengthening of water sources from now on.
4) Reference No. As per the instructions given under the government decision, senior geologists, assistant geologists, junior geologists in the Ground Water Survey and Development System should take up the work of preparing watershed-wise and village-wise plans for possible scarcity. 50 per cent in each district.

There is less rain. The water level is 2 meters above average.
It's gone down. A list of such villages should be prepared immediately.
Steps should be taken to ensure that the village gets the benefit of water from the sources of the ongoing schemes under the National Rural Drinking Water Programme, Jal Swarajya Phase-2 and Chief Minister's Rural Drinking Water Programme etc. on a war footing.
6) The District Collector should take necessary action to repair the existing borewells in each district from time to time and keep them in working condition.
7) Many schemes in the district depend on the water of these large, medium and small irrigation projects. Consider how much water you need to drink. Planning should be done for the use of this project by keeping the required amount of water in the reservoir for drinking. The local bodies should ensure that there is no wastage of water.
8) A Potential Water Scarcity Action Plan for the year 2020-21 should be prepared and submitted to the Government with suitable measures for the possible water scarcity affected villages/ hamlets in the State. While formulating the action plan, it should be consciously kept in mind that relatively low cost measures will be proposed which can be availed of during the period of scarcity. There has been a marked difference between the number of measures taken and the actual number of measures taken to address the drinking water shortage in 2019-20. However, the number of proposed measures in the Potential Shortage Action Plan should be accurately reported.
9) To determine the immediate measures to be taken to solve the drinking water shortage, the cost incurred, its future benefit and the measures to be implemented.
Consideration should be given to the time required. While selecting the scarcity mitigation measures, it should be ensured that the cost is minimum considering the available information, duration of scarcity and local conditions. like this
The Collector will be in charge of the implementation of the scarcity action plan prepared.

10) Drinking water is supplied by tankers, bullock carts in places where other urgent measures cannot be taken. The government's policy is to use government tankers whenever possible. However, it is experienced that whenever the District Collectors request tankers from the field officers of the concerned department for supply of drinking water, they are often provided with tankers which are not in good condition or not in use. As a result, the district collector is forced to hire private tankers for this work and the government expenditure increases to a great extent. Therefore, all the field officers are being strictly instructed to keep the tankers under them in good condition and supply them in a fully functional condition as soon as the Collector demands for supply of drinking water.
11) If it is found that the permanent shortage will not be solved by passing a ban order or taking temporary measures to solve the water shortage in your department, the zonal system must plan and collect information. For this, it is necessary to collect the information about the villages supplied water by tankers in the last five years, list of villages/ villages/ wells by taluk and year, maps of these villages and information about the expenditure on tankers, etc. and prepare a possible scarcity action plan for further planning on that basis. Also, while accepting a new tender for the control of tanker trips while supplying drinking water by tanker and while entering into agreements with the tanker owners, the condition of installing GPS system on the tanker and the maintenance of this system by the tanker transporter at his own cost should be fulfilled.
12) To avoid delay by the Regional Office in approving urgent water supply schemes for drinking water shortage in the urban areas of your division, Reference No. 3 Proposals which do not meet the financial and physical criteria prescribed under the provisions of the Government Decision should be submitted to the Government with a strong reason and a clear recommendation. Also, the action plans for possible shortages should be submitted to the government along with the expected expenditure.
