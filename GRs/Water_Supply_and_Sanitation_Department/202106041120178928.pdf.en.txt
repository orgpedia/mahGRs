The Proposal:
As the Government has taken the responsibility of payment of salary, allowances and pension to the employees of Maharashtra Jeevan Authority under the Government Decision dated 23.3.2017 and as it is likely to take a long time for the payment of pension to the retired employees of Maharashtra Jeevan Authority through the Treasury from the regular Principal Accounts Title 2071, the Finance Department has agreed to extend the new Account Title 2215A052 for the year 2021-22, which has been created temporarily to provide subsidy to the Authority for the retirement of retired employees of Maharashtra Jeevan Authority. The Nosti has been submitted to the Accountant General's Office, Nagpur for approval of the Accountant General, Nagpur. However, as the approval of the Accountant General's Office, Nagpur is likely to take some more time, the matter of disbursement of grants to the Maharashtra Life Authority under the account head 22158052 for the financial year 2021-22, subject to the approval of the Accountant General's Office, Nagpur, is under the consideration of the Government.
