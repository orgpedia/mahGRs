Read- 1) Decisions of the Government, P.P. and Self V., No.: Shortage 1099/ Q. No.12/ Papu-14, dated 3rd February, 1999.
Preamble: Most of the years in the State, there is scarcity of drinking water in rural/ urban areas due to inadequate rainfall or other reasons. The Government has issued detailed instructions through Standing Orders from time to time for measures to be taken in rural/ urban areas to address the drinking water shortage. In this regard, under the Government Decision dated 3rd February, 1999, action has been decided on the measures to be taken to solve the drinking water shortage in rural areas. As per the provisions of the Maharashtra Ground Water (Development and Management) Act, 2009, the district collectors have the power to declare drinking water scarcity at any time and take appropriate remedial measures under it. It is expected that action will be taken to take a re-look at the tankers running in the state and continue the tankers where necessary. Therefore, it was under the consideration of the government to give instructions to review the measures being taken under the shortage in the current year should not continue even if there is no need.
If the drinking water measures are to be continued under the scarcity after the Government Circular dated 30th June 2020, the Collector shall review the scarcity situation and take steps as per the provisions of the Maharashtra Ground Water (Development and Management) Act, 2009 in the areas where there is scarcity of drinking water.
