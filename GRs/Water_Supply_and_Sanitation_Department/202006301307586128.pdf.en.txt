the prelude
As per the guidelines dated 25.12.2019 issued by the Government of India, Government of India is committed to provide" Har Ghar Nal Se Jal" (Functional Household Tap Connection) to all rural households in the country by 2024. At present, the centrally sponsored National Rural Drinking Water Programme, the State sponsored Chief Minister's Rural Drinking Water Programme and the World Bank funded Jal Swarojya Programme are being implemented successfully in the State. Under the rural drinking water programme, the government had set a target of supplying 40 litres of water per person per day. However, under the Jal Jeevan Mission programme, in order to improve the quality of life of the people in rural areas, a target has been set to provide 55 litres of potable water per person per day through household tap connections. In view of the above changing policy of the Central Government, it is necessary to undertake corrective retrofitting of the schemes by using the existing appendages of various schemes implemented earlier by the Central Government and the State Governments and making some changes in them as per the need. The government was contemplating issuing guidelines in this regard.
Government's decision:
Under the Jal Jeevan Mission programme, each household in all the wards of the 34 districts of the state is expected to be supplied water through individual taps in a phased manner. This has been clarified in the Jal Jeevan Mission guidelines. Similarly, the Annual Action Plan prepared by the districts has included the work of retrofitting for such individual tap connections. For such villages, instructions are being given to prepare the budget for the schemes to be taken up in the first phase for retrofitting.
The following steps should be taken to ensure availability of 55 litres of water per capita per day from the schemes which have not completed their conception period or life of the scheme and which are presently supplying water through community/ public taps.
Existing schemes which are capable of supplying 55 litres per capita per day or, in which the pumping hours have been increased/ marginally improved to

In schemes where 55 litres of water can be supplied per day, individual tap connections should be included under the head of retrofitting and individual tap connections should be started immediately.
2. In the above villages, augmented distribution channels within the village, if required, should also be included in the same corrective retrofitting.
3. In point number 2 above, the budget should be prepared as per the prevailing rate schedule for distribution system. The rate for tap connection for providing individual tap connections should be taken as per Annexure-A attached.
Technical approval, administrative approval, powers to implement, powers to accept tenders for the above works shall be as per the guidelines issued by the Government from time to time.
5. Each district is required to achieve the target of maximum functional tap connections through the above measures.
The details of villages/ hamlets which have been provided with 100% tap water connection by following the above steps should be recorded on the IMIS system from time to time.
The funds received by the Gram Panchayats under the Finance Commission can also be used for the above mentioned purposes.
Separate orders will be issued regarding the ongoing schemes of rural water supply in the state and the schemes in which it will not be possible to supply 55 liters of water per day per person only through retrofitting.
