The Government Decision dated 30.01.2023 provides that in cases where the Zila Parishad concerned has not yet paid the pensionary financial benefits, the Zila Parishad concerned shall submit a proposal to the Government seeking payment of the dues along with an employee-wise exact calculation and pay the allowable dues of the concerned employees in a phased manner over a period of next 5 years. Accordingly, the concerned Zila Parishads have been informed under letter (3) under reference to properly calculate the employee-wise arrears and submit the information in a statement signed by the CEO and certified by the Chief Accounts and Finance Officer. Accordingly, it was under the consideration of the Government to disburse the funds to the respective Zila Parishads as allowable instalments of salary arrears of the employees working / retired under the Zila Parishads who have submitted detailed and accurate information of the arrears. Accordingly, the following decision has been taken.
Government Decision: - Considering the detailed information of the arrears submitted by the Zilla Parishad, Nanded under the letter (9) in this regard, a total amount of Rs.22151914.36-Auxiliary Grants-in-Aid (Salary) is being disbursed to the Nanded Zilla Parishad for three instalments of the arrears of salary of 21 retired employees under this Zilla Parishad for a total amount of Rs.
The list of employees who are to be paid three instalments of dues from the aforesaid fund is given in the accompanying letter.
The Fund is being disbursed subject to the following terms and conditions.
a) The District Treasury should not approve the payment unless certified by the CEO as well as the Chief Accounts and Finance Officer that the calculation of the dues of the employees concerned is accurate. This fund should be used for the allowable salary arrears of the retired employees in the accompanying co-signer. The Chief Accounts and Finance Officer will be responsible for ensuring that these funds are not used for other purposes.
No increase shall be admissible by the Government to indicate any future increase in the amount of arrears communicated by the Bozillah Council under letter (9) in reference.
c) The Zilla Parishad shall pay these amounts to the concerned employees only after ensuring that the dues to the concerned employees have not been paid earlier.
d) No interest will be payable on this outstanding amount to the employees concerned from the Government funds.

e) The Zilla Parishad should obtain a Saar bond from the employees concerned stating that the amount will be recovered from the employees concerned if it is found that the excess amount has been paid due to a calculation error or other reasons.
4. Since the subsidy is for salary, it is "unconditional" in nature as per the Government Decision dated 12.01.2023 of the Department of Finance. However, employee-wise details of the amounts paid to the employees from the aforesaid fund as well as the certificate of fulfilment of the aforesaid conditions should be made available by the CEO of the concerned Zila Parishad while seeking further instalment of funds.
If it is found that the funds have been used for reasons other than the prescribed benefit or for arrears to other employees, disciplinary action will be taken fixing liability for this financial irregularity.
6. The expenditure incurred in the case should be reconciled with the expenditure reported by the Accountant General's office from time to time. Further funds will not be disbursed if the coordination work is pending. Subsidies provided by the government will be mandatory to provide ECS ER in the bank accounts of the beneficiaries. Under no circumstances should the grant amount be disbursed in a lump-sum and offline manner.
