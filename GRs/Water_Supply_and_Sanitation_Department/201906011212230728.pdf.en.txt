Water supply schemes in the state are implemented through the Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran and the Zilla Parishads. The waste generated during the laying of HDPE/ PVC pipes and the unutilized fragments/ fragments of various HDPE/ PVC water lines used in the execution of such schemes are disposed of in the form of waste in the same place. Although this material is useless, the waste generated in the form of non-degradable waste causes environmental problems. To avoid this problem, the implementing agencies (Zilla Parishad, Maharashtra Jeevan Authority) should take care to instruct the concerned contractor to properly dispose of the remaining pieces/ broken parts etc. of HDPE/ PVC water channels used for the water supply scheme. It shall be the responsibility of the concerned Deputy Engineer/ Branch Engineer to ensure that the non-usable pieces/ parts etc. of the water lines are not left in a scattered form at the work site. Contractors should collect HDPE/ PVC waste and send it to recycling companies/ institutions/ individuals for recycling without dumping it elsewhere.
