GOVERNMENT DECISIONS, WATER AND SANCTION DEPARTMENT NO.: MAJIPRA-2014/ PR No.33 (A)/ PAPU-23 dated 23.03.2017.
The Proposal:
A policy decision to take over the responsibility of salary, allowances and pension of the officers and employees of Maharashtra Jeevan Authority and to deposit the ETP charges and technical fees collected from the Maharashtra Jeevan Authority to the Government was taken in the Cabinet meeting dated 16.03.2017 and accordingly the Government decision has been issued on 23.03.2017. In the winter session of December, 2017, for the expenditure on pension of retired employees of Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran," Demand No. G-6, 2071- Pension and other retirement benefits, 101- Fixed term and retirement allowances, (02)-D. For service after 1st April, 1936, (02) (01) D. A figurative Supplementary Demand was placed before the Legislature under the head' Expenditure on Pension for Service after 1st April, 1936 (Compulsory) (2071 0103)'. However, no expenditure could be incurred for the pension of employees retired from the Authority under this head in 2017-18 due to technical difficulties.
Since it will take some time to pay the retirement salary of retired employees of Maharashtra Life Authority on a regular basis under the account head 20710103 like other retired government employees, the government was considering to create a new account head for the financial year 2018-19.
