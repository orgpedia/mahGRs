The administrative approval of the scheme stipulates that 50% of the funds should be disbursed at the beginning of the scheme and the remaining 50% should be disbursed after the completion of the scheme.
However, while disbursing funds for the measures taken under scarcity, 50% of the funds should be disbursed at the beginning of the scheme. However, the remaining funds, as per the requirement of the scheme and the progress made, should be reviewed by the Divisional Commissioner on a case-by-case basis and a decision should be taken to disburse the funds to the concerned for starting water supply by completing 80 per cent of the total cost of the scheme before the completion of the scheme, within the scheme period, within the scarcity period.
(2) Whereas, at the level of the Government, while distributing the funds to the Divisional Commissioners, the funds have been distributed in accordance with the demand of the District Collectors, but prior permission of the Government is not required to use these funds for other measures or for other districts of their division. In this regard, the Divisional Commissioner should take a decision and give permission to the concerned District Collector and inform the government accordingly.
3) Funds received under scarcity at the government level need to be disbursed to pay the well acquisition dues on priority. Under no circumstances should the payments for the acquisition of the well be pending. The payments for the acquisition of this well must be made within a month's time, this must be taken care of by the Chief Executive Officer, Zilla Parishad.
4) Urban and rural measures taken under scarcity are given administrative approval from the government level or the district collector level.
However, if any dispute arises regarding such schemes, the Divisional Commissioner should take an appropriate decision in consultation with the concerned District Collector, Chief Executive Officer, Zilla Parishad as well as the concerned Superintending Engineer, Maharashtra Life Authority, as per the requirement. The decision taken by the District Collector will be final. In such cases, there should be no unnecessary delay in completing the scheme or finalizing the payments of the scheme by sending proposals to the government.
