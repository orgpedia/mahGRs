Government of India, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation Letter No. S- 11011/2018 SBM, dated 07/08/2018.
Submitted on October 2, 2014. The Prime Minister launched the Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin). On the occasion of 150th Birth Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi i.e. on 02/10/2019, it has been decided to make the entire country open defecation free.
Accordingly, effective implementation has been done in the sanitation sector in the state till date. As per the 2012 baseline survey, the entire State of Maharashtra (Rural) has become Open Defecation Free on 18th April 2018. In order to ensure sustainable use of sanitation facilities created in the Gram Panchayat and to meet the remaining objectives, it is imperative that cleanliness through Swachhagrahi remains intact and public participation remains at the core to bring about a positive change in the sanitation habits of the people. The Swachhagrahi concept has come forward to develop village-level sanitation leadership, to address the sanitation issues of the people immediately.
Public participation is expected to be activated at the village level by determining measures for creation, maintenance and utilization of individual, public and institutional sanitation facilities, management of wastewater and solid waste, availability and safety of clean drinking water.
Under the Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin), the scope of sanitation is broad and includes elements related to cleanliness. Rural households still do not have access to sanitation facilities in some places. Many questions have also been raised regarding the quality and sustainability of sanitation facilities, and the persistence of social and individual behavioural changes. These things are much faster.
