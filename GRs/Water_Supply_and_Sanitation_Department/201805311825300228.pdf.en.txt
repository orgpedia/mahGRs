If any officer directly or indirectly tries to pressurize the order to be modified, it should be recorded in the confidential report of the concerned officer. Such officers will be liable for disciplinary action as the act violates Rule 3 (3) and Rule 23 of the Maharashtra Civil Services (Conduct) Rules, 1979.
Since these transfers are required to be effected effectively, the salary of all the transferred officers up to 31st May, 2018 shall be drawn by the office in which they are presently working.
Salaries due from June 1, 2018 should not be withdrawn from the pre-transfer office under any circumstances. The concerned officers should collect the salary from the post-transfer office after appearing in the office of the transferor and submit a report to the government.
It may be noted that if the transferred officers are not relieved by 31/05/2018 (M.N.), action will be taken to relieve the concerned officers unilaterally by the Water Supply and Sanitation Department.
These orders will come into force with immediate effect. The Director, Ground Water Survey and Development Agency is being informed to immediately submit to the government the information whether the transferred officers have been relieved of their duties and how they have joined the transferred office.
