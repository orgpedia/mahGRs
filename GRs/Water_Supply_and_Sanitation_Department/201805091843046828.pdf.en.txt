Since the expenditure on tankers was not allowable from the scarcity mitigation programme, the meeting had decided to request the Relief and Rehabilitation Department to approve the proposal as a special case. However, the District Collector, Yavatmal, had submitted a separate proposal to the Urban Development Department to sanction the expenditure on tankers for the Yavatmal Municipal Council. This proposal is a one-time matter under shortage. The Chief Minister has approved it. Accordingly, Rs. A proposal of Rs 352.22 lakh was under the consideration of the government for administrative approval.
As per the decision taken by the government, Rs. 352.22 lakh has been approved as mentioned in the proposal. Accordingly, the proposal is being accorded administrative approval subject to the following conditions:
1) The District Collector, Yavatmal should first declare that there is a shortage of drinking water in Yavatmal city.
2) The government has allocated Rs. 352.22 lakhs i.e. 90% of the cost of Rs. 317.00 lakhs will be provided. The remaining 10% is Rs. 35.22 lakh should be paid by the Yavatmal Municipal Council in the form of public contribution.
3) GPS system must be installed on the tanker while making payments for supply of drinking water. Only those trips of tankers which are recorded on the GPS system will be allowed for payment. If the tanker transport holder claims that the tanker has made trips due to the system or GPS system being down, such trips will be considered as fake. Also, payments should not be authenticated as the GPS system does not register and payments authenticated in this manner should not be paid.
