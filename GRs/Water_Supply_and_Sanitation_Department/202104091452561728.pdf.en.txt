If the local body is unable to supply adequate drinking water, it is necessary to provide water for normal drinking use through tankers. Also, drinking water tankers need to be sanctioned considering the shortage situation. As the district administration is busy in the control activities of the Novel Corona (Covid-19) epidemic, the matter of conferring the tanker sanctioning powers to the concerned sub-divisional officers was under the consideration of the government.
Considering the shortage of drinking water in the wake of Novel Corona (Covid 19) Vishnunu, the Collector was empowered to sanction drinking water tankers. In view of the Corona epidemic in the state, the concerned Sub Divisional Officers and Sub Divisional Magistrates are now being empowered for the shortage period of 2020-21 till June 30, 2021.
