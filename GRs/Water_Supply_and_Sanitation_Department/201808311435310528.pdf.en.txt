The proposal
The Cabinet in its meeting held on 16.03.2017 has taken a policy decision to take over the responsibility of salary, allowances and pension of the officers and employees of Maharashtra Life Authority and to deposit the ETP charges and technical fees collected from the Maharashtra Life Authority with the Government. Due to the financial situation of Maharashtra Jeevan Authority, the Authority has made dearness allowance of 113 per cent permissible to the officers/ employees of the Authority with effect from 01.01.2015. Since the Government has taken the responsibility of the salary/ allowances of these employees, it was under consideration of the Government to make the Dearness Allowance admissible to the employees of the Authority on par with the State Government employees from 23.03.2017 onwards. The following decision has been taken:

Government's decision
Dearness Allowance is being sanctioned to the regular officers/ employees of Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran on par with State Government employees with effect from 23.03.2017.
Dearness Allowance at the rate of 136% is being applied to the regular officers/ employees and retired employees of the MGP for the period from 23.03.2017 to 30.06.2017. Since the amount of technical fee has started to be deposited with the Government, the arrears of Dearness Allowance for the period from 23.03.2017 to 30.06.2017 should be paid by the MGNREGA from their own funds.
From 01.07.2017 to till date, Dearness Allowance at the rate of 139% is being paid to the regular officers/ employees/ retired employees of the State Government. And since the amount of technical fee has started to be deposited with the Government, the arrears of dearness allowance before 01.01.2018 should be paid by the MGNREGA from their own funds.
Expenditure of arrears of Dearness Allowance on regular officers/ employees working in the MGNREGS from 01.01.2018 onwards vide Demand No. Y-2, 2215-Water Supply and Sanitation, 01-Water Supply, 001-Operation and Administration, (01)-Establishment, (01) (04)-Assistant Grants in lieu of Salary and Allowances to Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran (2215041) (Mandatory/ Datta Mat), 36-Assistant Grants (Salaries).
Since the liability of salary/ allowances/ pension before 23.03.2017 is of the Majipra, the decision regarding dearness allowance before this date shall be taken by the Majipra and the expenditure thereon shall be borne by the Majipra out of its own funds.
This Government Resolution is being issued in accordance with the concurrence received under the Informal Reference No. 186/ Expenditure-3 of the Department of Finance dated 29.06.2018, 194/ Finance- 18/18 dated 23.07.2018.
