Under the programme, various types of regional or separate water supply schemes are implemented in rural areas. The implementation of this water supply scheme is also done directly by the contractor by conducting the tender process as per the prevailing system of the government.
However, with the introduction of the" Goods and Services Tax" regime in the State with effect from 01.07.2017, the cost of the contract may also increase or decrease due to increase or decrease in the tax burden in the contracts for water supply schemes.
