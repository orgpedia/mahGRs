If any officer directly or indirectly tries to pressurize the order to be modified, it should be recorded in the confidential report of the concerned officer. Such officers will be liable for disciplinary action as the act violates Rule 3 (3) and Rule 23 of the Maharashtra Civil Services (Conduct) Rules, 1979.
Since these transfers are required to be effected effectively, the salary of all the transferred officers up to 31st May, 2019 shall be drawn by the office in which they are presently working.
