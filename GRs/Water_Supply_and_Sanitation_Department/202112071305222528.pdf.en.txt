The proposal has been sent for administrative approval. A lot of time is wasted and wasted. In view of this, the following recommendations have been made:
1. For acceptance of tender at the level of Maharashtra Life Authority. The excess rate tenders approved by the Committee at the level of Minister (Water Supply and Sanitation) are submitted to the Government for approval before the work order is issued. However, if the cost of the scheme is in the range of 15% of the original budgeted cost and the current tariff list or below, further proceedings (work order, contract with contractor, etc.) should be initiated immediately.
(2) It shall be ensured that the expenditure on the scheme will be limited to the original budgeted cost till the revised plan is approved. Proposals for revised administrative approval should be submitted to the Government within one month.
Apart from this, the rest of the proposals should be submitted to the government by the Maharashtra Life Authority along with the reason. No further action (work order, contract with contractor, etc.) should be taken on the scheme without obtaining Government approval for such schemes.
