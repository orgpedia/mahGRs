The government has decided to provide Rs. The revised budget of Rs. 44.65/-lakh (Rupees Forty Four Lakhs Fifty Five Thousand only) is being accorded administrative approval subject to the following conditions:
Conditions
1) The remaining work should be completed in 3 months at the revised price mentioned above.
2) The terms and conditions mentioned in the original administrative approval and revised technical approval of the scheme should be strictly followed.
3) Once the scheme is completed, it should be handed over to the concerned Gram Panchayat. The project has been completed by the concerned Executive Engineer, Rural Water Supply Department, G. P. Nanded. The concerned Gram Panchayat/ Zila Parishad will be responsible for taking over the scheme within one month from the date of receipt of the notification in this regard.
As soon as the scheme is completed, the concerned executive engineer, zilla parishad, Nanded and concerned gram panchayat officials should conduct a joint inspection of the scheme and if any defects are found in such inspection, they should be rectified before handing over the scheme.
4) The concerned Gram Panchayat/ Zilla Parishad will not get any assistance from the Government for the implementation of the scheme, its maintenance, repairs (including special amendments), meeting recurring expenditure incurred every year, depreciation in the scheme or renovation of machinery.
After the completion of this scheme, it will be mandatory for the local self-government institution (concerned Gram Panchayat/ Zila Parishad) to transfer the scheme. The accounts of the scheme should also be closed.
As per the CAG report of 2013, 21% of the water supply schemes in the state have been closed due to non-payment of electricity dues, due to lack of maintenance and repairs. Therefore, in order to keep the scheme financially sound, the responsibility of increasing the water tariff as per the requirement will be of the concerned Gram Panchayat/ Zila Parishad.
7) Action should be taken according to the prevailing policy on openness.
8) It shall be the responsibility of the District Council to ensure that the present scheme is not revised under any circumstances.
