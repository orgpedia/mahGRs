GPS system has been made mandatory to avoid irregularities in the distribution of water supply through tankers and for efficient control. However, the GPS system is not being fully used to control the supply of water through tankers from the Collector's office, Zilla Parishad and Panchayat Samiti level. The government was considering issuing a notification in this regard.
The Government Circulars should be obtained from the User IDs and Passwords of all Taluks by the District Shortage Cell/ Collector's Office from the Contractor/ Computer Command Agent and made available to the Panchayat Samiti Office. The district scarcity cell should coordinate the changes and ensure that the user ID and password are updated and in use. Separate user IDs and passwords should be made available for control at the district shortage cell and zilla parishad level.
2. Round trips/ km trips made through Tanker GPS system on daily/ weekly basis at Panchayat Samiti level. A copy of this report with the signature of the Block Development Officer should be preserved in the records of the Panchayat Samiti office.
Whether the GPS system is operational at least once in a week by the Block Development Officer/ Deputy Engineer, Rural Water Supply? Are all the gps installed? Are all the tankers showing up on the GPS system? This should be verified. If there is a discrepancy in this, the matter should be brought to the notice of the district scarcity cell by telephone and in writing.
The number of daily rounds on the logbook must be verified on the basis of the distance and time indicated on the GPS system, the distance certified by the Public Works Department, and payments must be made accordingly. Payments for tanker trips should not be made on the basis of records alone. Tankers who do not receive the GPS report of the day and the report does not match the time and distance of the tanker should not pay for the trips.
There are complaints that the tanker is not visible on the GPS system for the first few days of starting the tanker. While the issue of GPS synchronisation while making tanker payments has been clearly mentioned, there have been complaints of payments being made through other archives.
6. The tanker supplier shall also clearly inform the tanker supplier that it intends to ensure that sufficient number of GPS sets are available in view of future water scarcity. Therefore, GPS system has been installed on the tanker from the first day of its commissioning.

Make sure that the tanker has arrived and is shown in the GPS system. It is mandatory to use the tanker only after the GPS system has been installed by the tanker supplier.
In case of non-receipt of tanker report from GPS system, payment for such trips shall not be made under any circumstances. The Collector will have the power to approve such payments if water is supplied without GPS in very exceptional circumstances.
8. Prior intimation of change in source of filling of tankers, change in villages/ habitations for supply of water is required to be given to the District Shortage Cell. The district scarcity cell/ district council shall notify the change in the system to the contractor/ computer command agent and the change in the GPS system shall be verified as per the instructions.
Capacity of tankers- should not exceed the carrying capacity as certified by the Transport Department. While certifying the capacity of tankers, the carrying capacity certified by the Transport Department should be taken into account while making payment of tankers.
10. In case of tankers where water supply is supplied by installing tanks on trucks, the capacity of the tank water tank should be validated by validation system. The tank capacity of all the tankers currently in operation should be certified in a phased manner within a period of one month. The work is to be completed by 10th April, 2019.
If the GPS set is damaged due to technical reasons, the computer is repaired by the command agent to the water supplier within 48 hours. Assuming that it is the responsibility of the tanker supply holder to keep the system in order, it should not be consumed for more than two days during the entire shortage period due to non-receipt of GPS report.
12. In case of discrepancies between the distances certified by the Public Works Department and those on the GPS system, the status of the village of origin and distribution should be assessed.
It will be mandatory for the service provider to do Geo Fencing in the GPS command line. In order to prepare and control the reports including the number of actual trips, the place and time of filling the tanker, the place of emptying the tanker, all the collectors should make it mandatory for the contractors to do geo fencing and make changes in it as per the instructions of the collector's office.
14. Water suppliers to take reports of tanker trips in unalterable PDF format.
Reports in Excel, Word format should not be accepted. You can't create a report in Word format. The report must be generated from the computer. In this regard, the tanker supplier/ computer commandant should give instructions to the supplier.
