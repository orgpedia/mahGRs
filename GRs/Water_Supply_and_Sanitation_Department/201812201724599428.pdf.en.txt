About 40 to 70 per cent of the total maintenance cost of water supply schemes is on electricity bills. This cost is met from the water bill. Electricity bills cannot be paid as the local bodies are unable to recover the water charges. Alternatively, the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company (MSEDCL) disconnects the power supply to such schemes. As a result, the project could be permanently stalled. The best option is to use solar energy. Also Ma. The Chief Minister has directed that the Mukhyamantri Gramin Drinking Water Scheme in small, economically low-income gram panchayats should be implemented using solar energy as they are facing difficulties in paying electricity bills. In pursuance of this directive, the government was considering issuing guidelines on the use of solar energy system for tap water supply schemes in small and economically low-income villages covered under the Chief Minister's Rural Drinking Water Programme.

GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: MUPAYO-2018/ PR No. 133/ PAPU-19 GOVERNMENT DECISION:
In view of the above mentioned fact, solar energy is being approved for tap water supply schemes up to 10 horsepower (HP) capacity sanctioned under the Chief Minister's Rural Drinking Water Programme. Accordingly, the implementing agencies (Zila Parishad/ Majipra) should take action by adopting the following procedures.
1) While installing the solar pump, it should be ensured that there is sufficient shadow free area available as per the criteria laid down by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, Government of India and that the place is in the name of the Gram Panchayat.
(2) The guidelines and technical measurements issued by the Ministry of Renewable Energy and Maharashtra Energy Development Agency (MAHED), Government of India, from time to time should be followed while installing solar pumps.
3) Installation of solar pumps should be done through an open tender process. The price of the solar pump coming for this tender should be decided according to the Central Government's Bench Mark Cost Rate Sheet.
The tender should stipulate a minimum of 5 years of annual maintenance repair for the installation of solar pumps (solar power sets, pumps, panels and accessories).
Before installing the solar pump, the test report of the efficiency of the solar pump should be obtained from the accredited laboratory of the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, New Delhi.
The capacity and suitability of the solar panels (modules) used for the pump should be as per the specifications of Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, Government of India. Also, the solar panel must be of Indian make. The warranty period of the solar panel should be 10 years.
7) Installation of non-transmission solar energy sets in places where power supply is not available. If necessary, the solar energy net metering system should be adopted as per the guidelines and circulars of the Maharashtra Electricity Transmission Company and the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission.
8) The safety of solar-powered pump panels should be given utmost importance. Guidelines issued by Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, Government of India

Government Decision No: MUPAYO-2018/ PR No. 133/ PAPU-19 should be used. Also, it is mandatory to build a wiring/ wall compound around the solar energy panel. Solar panels should be installed at a height of at least 2-3 meters from the ground.
Technical approval should be obtained from Maharashtra Energy Development Agency (MAHAPURA) before installing solar power pumps. Also, after the installation of the solar pump is completed and the water supply scheme is operational, 100 percent technical inspection of the same should be done by the General Energy and Zilla Parishad/ Majipra.
If the use of solar energy pumps for the tap water supply schemes approved under the Chief Minister's Rural Drinking Water Programme increases the original administrative approval cost of the scheme, the budgets of such schemes should be submitted to the government for revised administrative approval.
