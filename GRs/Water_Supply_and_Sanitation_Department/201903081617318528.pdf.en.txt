GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: MUPAYO-2018/ PR No. 178/ PAPU-19
Preamble: The Central Government vide letter dated 11th May, 2015 at Reference No.13 has indicated its priority for completion of rural water supply schemes at Pragatipath and vide letter dated 29th June, 2015 at Reference No.14 has brought to the notice of the State Government the long pending water supply schemes. Accordingly, the Central Government has issued instructions that no new schemes should be taken up except for (i) permanent and temporary measures for fluoride and arsenic affected villages/ hamlets (ii) villages/ hamlets covered under Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana and (iii) taking up new schemes only if there is no scheme in progress in the State.
Since the Central Government has prohibited the implementation of new water supply schemes in places other than the above-mentioned category of villages/ hamlets, the State Government has decided to implement the scheme in the context No. 1 here. As per the Government decision dated 7th May, 2016, it has been decided to implement its own comprehensive Chief Minister Rural Drinking Water Programme. Recently, since the Central Government has allowed to take water supply schemes in the villages free of open defecation under the National Rural Drinking Water Program and the entire Maharashtra has been declared open defecation free, as well as the financial liability on the schemes in progress has been reduced, the transfer of 37 water supply schemes being implemented by the Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran under the Chief Minister's Rural Drinking Water Program to the National Rural Drinking Water Program was under consideration.
Pursuant to the discussions held in the review meeting of National Rural Drinking Water Programme held on 20.09.2018 at New Delhi, the State Level Scheme Sanctioning Committee (SLSSC) in its 30th meeting held on 11.02.2019 approved the implementation of the scheme under the Chief Minister's Rural Drinking Water Programme with an outlay of Rs. It has been decided to transfer 37 water supply schemes worth Rs. 1031.70 crore to National Rural Drinking Water Programme. Accordingly, the government was considering revoking the administrative approval given under the Chief Minister's Rural Drinking Water Programme to these 37 water supply schemes and giving fresh administrative approval under the National Rural Drinking Water Programme.
