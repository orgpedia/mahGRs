The Proposal:
In order to achieve the target of providing" Har Ghar Nal Se Jal" to rural households by 2024, the State Government has decided to implement Jal Jeevan Mission in the State as per the decision of the Government No. As per this decision, the entire responsibility of implementing the Jal Jeevan Mission in the district has been entrusted to the District Water and Sanitation Mission.
As per Section 79 (A) of the Maharashtra Zilla Parishad and Panchayat Samiti Act, 1961, the District Water and Sanitation Mission has been set up in every Zilla Parishad and through them the Jal Jeevan Mission is being implemented from the districts. Therefore, the role of the Executive Engineer in the Zilla Parishad and the Rural Water Supply Department is very important for the effective implementation of the Jal Jeevan Mission in the district.
The posts of executive engineers in the rural water supply department in the zilla parishads of the state are filled on deputation from the executive engineers of the Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran.
The deputation orders are issued by the Maharashtra Life Authority. At present, the posts of executive engineers in the rural water supply department are vacant in many district councils of the state.

The additional charge of these posts has been handed over to another executive engineer or deputy engineer of the district council.
For effective implementation of the newly launched Jal Jeevan Mission in the State and for the Mission to be more effective, the existing implementation mechanism needs to be revamped. Therefore, in order to ensure the implementation of Jal Jeevan Mission at the district level, the government has decided to assign additional charge to the selected executive engineer of Maharashtra Jeevan Authority in those zilla parishads where there is no full-time executive engineer in the rural water supply department.
Government order:
In view of the fact stated in the Preamble, that the posts of Executive Engineer in the Rural Water Supply Department in the following Zilla Parishads of the State are lying vacant, the additional charge of these posts is being handed over to the Executive Engineer in the Maharashtra Life Authority as shown in the table till further orders.
