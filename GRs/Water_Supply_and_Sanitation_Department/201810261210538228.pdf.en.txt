Circular: There has been unsatisfactory rainfall in the state this year. There is a possibility of severe water shortage in some districts of the state this year. However, drinking water is being supplied through tankers in some districts of the state. The Government has issued detailed instructions from time to time through Standing Orders on the measures to be taken in rural/ urban areas to address the drinking water shortage.

Accordingly, the following precautions/ measures are being advised to be taken to address the possible drinking water shortage in the State this year: 1. Due to scanty rainfall in some districts/ areas of the State, drinking water scarcity has been created in those districts/ areas or water scarcity is going to occur in some time. In view of this, it is expected to initiate action as per the instructions in the Standing Orders issued by the Government during the period of shortage. Copies of the relevant government decisions should be made available immediately if they are not available.
2) Detailed instructions on handling shortages have been given in the context of the Standing Orders as well as the Government Circular dated 14th February, 2018.
Appropriate action should be taken immediately.
3. Supply of water through tankers/ bullock carts:- Supply of water through tankers/ bullock carts is a costly affair if the supply of drinking water is not possible through contingency measures. This scheme is not very convenient for the citizens. These measures should only be taken in exceptional circumstances.
For this, first of all, the government tankers available in your respective districts should be fully utilized. Private tankers should be allowed to supply water only when government tankers/ vehicles are not available. With a view to ensure that the scheme of supply of water by tankers during acute shortage of drinking water is implemented in a more efficient manner and there is no scope for complaints, the guidelines issued vide the relevant Government Circular dated 24th January, 2006 should be strictly implemented.
4) A separate cell should be set up in the office of each district collector for shortage control and coordination to overcome the shortage situation at the district level. A Deputy Collector-rank officer should be appointed as the head of this cell.
This should be informed to the government.
Redressal of Grievances:- The complaints of water shortage from the public should be promptly recorded and remedial measures should be taken. A large number of complaints are raised by the people's representatives and newspapers if the water shortage prevention program is flawed. Immediate action should be taken to prevent such incidents. The district collector should also send a clarification to the newspaper by taking appropriate measures regarding the news regarding the shortage of drinking water.
