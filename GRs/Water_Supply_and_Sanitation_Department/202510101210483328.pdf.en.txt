| While formulating the action plan, it should be consciously ensured that comparable low-cost measures are proposed for schemes that can be availed only during the lean period.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ii. There has been a marked difference between the data on the funds required in the action plan for drinking water scarcity and the expenditure on the measures taken to actually address the scarcity thereafter. Since the budgetary provision is being proposed by the government taking into account the fund demand in the action plan, the accounting objections are often raised by the Accountant General's office as the actual expenditure figures are inconsistent with the provision made thereafter. Considering this fact, the actual expenditure under the water scarcity measures in the district in the last 3 years, it should be ensured that the data in this year's action plan is realistic. |
