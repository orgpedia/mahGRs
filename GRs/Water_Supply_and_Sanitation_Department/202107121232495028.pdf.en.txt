Preamble: Under the Central Government's ambitious Jal Jeevan Mission, the Government aims to provide safe and pure drinking water to the rural population as per the prescribed standards in water quality control and survey programmes. The water quality control and survey activities include inspection and survey of all drinking water sources in the State, setting up of water quality testing laboratories, strengthening of laboratories, national certification of laboratories, conducting awareness and education programmes on water quality at Gram Panchayat level, increasing public participation in sanitation survey activities, empowering the community to test water quality through Field Testing Kits (FTKs), especially training women from the local community for the same.
To ensure supply of clean and pure water at village level, create awareness about water quality and empower the community especially local women to test the water quality of water sources in Gram Panchayats through Field Testing Kits (FTKs), train them for the same and also to focus on testing of water samples with a view to prevention and control of epidemics in rural areas falling under Gram Panchayats

The government was considering a policy on the use, procurement and distribution of biological FTK-HRS vials for testing drinking water sources. At present, the matter of determining this policy on a pilot basis was under the consideration of the government.
Government Decision: Drinking water sources under Gram Panchayats to be made organic on pilot basis
The use, purchase, and use of biological FTK-HRS vials for the testing of FTK-HRS vials
The distribution policy is as follows:
1) Empowering local women at village level for water quality testing and use of organic FTK-HRS vials for testing: a) Primary source of drinking water in each Gram Panchayat under the scheme.
It is proposed to conduct water quality testing through biological FTK-HRS vials on pilot basis and verify whether the water sample is potable or not. For this, one source in each Gram Panchayat should be selected for testing through Biological FTK H2S vials.
The selected source should be subjected to water quality testing through biological FTK-HRS vials once in a year.
b) Five women from the local community should be selected under each Gram Panchayat through the Gram Water and Sanitation Committee and Water Usage Group. They should be trained to carry out water quality testing as well as to create awareness in terms of water quality through FTK in collaboration with Bhujal Survekshan and Development Mechanism, Pune.
a) A trained woman from a village selected for a drinking water source
Water quality testing for the following components should be carried out once a year by volunteers through biological FTK-H2S vials.

The water quality test report of the water source inspected by the biological FTK-HRS vials in the Gram Panchayat should be prepared by the trained women volunteers with the help of the water conservator and the Gramsevak as given in Sample 1 and submitted to the concerned Block Development Officer, Panchayat Samiti in the prescribed format (Sample 1) attached with the signature of the Gramsevak.
(e) The Panchayat Committee shall compile the reports of all the Gram Panchayats in the Taluka and submit the report to the Chief Executive Officer, Zilla Parishad.
(e) In case of non-compliance of drinking water sample during testing by biological FTK-HRS vials, immediate action should be taken by the concerned Gram Panchayat to rectify the problem.
(f) The sample of water from sources found biologically unfit for drinking should be re-tested after water purification and if the sample is found unfit for drinking even after re-testing, it should be sent to the nearest groundwater survey and development system laboratory for testing and as per its findings, immediate measures should be taken by the Gram Panchayat for source purification.
2) Record on the website: The concerned Zilla Parishad will be responsible for collecting all the reports at the ZP level and recording these tests, as well as the names of the trained women volunteers, the number of biological FTK-HRS vials kits received, their distribution at the Gram Panchayat level and the samples examined by the biological HRS vials sets in the prescribed samples on the IMIS website of the Central Government.
3) Procurement of Biological FTK-HRS vials required for water quality testing: The State Water and Sanitation Missions should procure the required Biological FTK-HRS vials centrally from their respective financial authorities. Further, the Government of the Department of Industry, Energy and Labor has decided to follow the procedure prescribed. The purchase should be made from the Government e-market place (GeM) portal developed by the Central Government as of August 24, 2017.
