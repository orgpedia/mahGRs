Introduction: Shahapur taluka of Thane district is a completely tribal taluka and its geographical situation is very fluctuating. The tribal areas of the district are in a shambles. The taluka is mountainous and covered with basalt rock. As a result, they have a low water holding capacity and dry up before summer. These villages have to be provided with drinking water through tankers.
Mumbai, Thane, Mira-Bhayander and Bhiwandi get water from the Bhatsa, Tansa, Modak Sagar and Middle Vaitarna dams. It is not economically feasible to plan water supply from these dams to the tanker affected villages/ hamlets as they are located at a very high altitude. Therefore, it is proposed to implement a regional water supply scheme based on grid system and gravity from Bhawali Dam in Igatpuri Taluka of Nashik district to 97 tribal villages and 259 villages in Shahapur Taluka.
The projected population of the year 2051 in the plan is 2,59,908. The scheme is proposed to cover 55 LPCD and above. The Department of Water Resources has approved the water reservation for the scheme as per the Government decision dated 23rd March, 2018.
