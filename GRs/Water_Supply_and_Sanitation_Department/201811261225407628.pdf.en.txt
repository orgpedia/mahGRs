All regional water supply schemes (permanent and seasonal) being run in rural areas of the state will be eligible for maintenance repair incentive grant under the Chief Minister's Rural Drinking Water Programme. Accordingly, the institutions/ agencies running the Regional Water Supply Scheme will be paid maintenance repair incentive in proportion to their catchment area as per the following formula.
a) For gravity based regional water supply schemes:
Incentive Grants= (Maintenance Repair Expenditure/ 2) X (Total Watershed Recovery/ Total Watershed Charges for 2017-18)
(b) for regional water supply schemes having electricity charges:
Incentive subsidy= (Electricity cost in 2017-18) X (Total water tariff recovery in 2017-18/ Total water tariff charge in 2017-18)
3. Proposals for grant of maintenance incentive for regional tap water supply schemes should be submitted at the level of Member Secretary, Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran (in case of Majipra schemes) and CEO, Zilla Parishad (in case of ZP/ SC schemes) to the Director, Water and Sanitation Support Society, Belapur, Navi Mumbai.
4. Maintenance-Reform Incentive subsidy is not an alternative to water table recovery. Therefore, it will be the responsibility of the concerned Gram Panchayat/ Zila Parishad to assess the water table required for the scheme to be financially self-sufficient and to make efforts for maximum recovery of the water table charged.
The incentive subsidy provided as above should be utilized by the institutions/ agencies running the Regional Water Supply Scheme for maintenance of the scheme only. This grant should not be distributed to the Gram Panchayats.
