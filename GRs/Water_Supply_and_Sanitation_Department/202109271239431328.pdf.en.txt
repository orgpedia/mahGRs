Government Circular: Every year in the state, due to insufficient rainfall or other reasons, there is a shortage of drinking water in rural/ urban areas. In order to avoid any confusion regarding the applications to be taken for drinking water shortage, this Department has issued Reference No. Standing Orders have been issued under Government Decisions 1, 2 and 3. According to the standing orders, the measures taken to address water scarcity will be implemented till June 30. The state has received good rainfall this year, but some areas have received less than normal rainfall. Considering the possibility of drinking water shortage in such areas in the coming summer, it is necessary to start action immediately in accordance with the instructions in the standing order under the government. The following recommendations are made:
(1) not to permit the digging of any wells for purposes other than the purpose of drinking water within a distance of 500 metres of the sources as per section 21 in the area of influence of public drinking water sources notified under section 20 of the Maharashtra Ground Water (Development and Management) Act, 2009, as well as prohibiting the extraction of ground water from such wells for a reasonable period of time by order of the District Authority if the groundwater depletion in the existing wells in the area of influence is found to be adversely affecting any public drinking water sources as per section 22.
(ii) Urgently take necessary action to take appropriate measures at the proposed minimum cost to mitigate water scarcity in the villages/ hamlets and urban areas as per the local conditions and sources as required.
3) Reference No. 2 Under the decision of the government here, instructions have been prepared to implement preventive measures at the village level to prevent water scarcity in the state.

have come. Accordingly, a program should be launched to implement various measures for water conservation and strengthening of water sources from now on.
4) Reference No. As per the instructions given under the government decision, senior geologists, assistant geologists, junior geologists in the Ground Water Survey and Development System should take up the work of preparing watershed-wise and village-wise plans for possible scarcity. All the districts in the state have received less than 50 per cent of the average rainfall. The water level is 2 metres below the average. A list of such villages should be prepared immediately.
Steps should be taken to ensure that the water of the ongoing schemes under the Jal Jeevan Mission program, Jal Swarajya Phase-2 and Mukhyamantri Rural Drinking Water Program, etc. in such villages is completed on a war footing and the village gets the benefit of the water.
6) The District Collector should take necessary action to repair the existing borewells in each district from time to time and keep them in working condition.
7) Many schemes in the district depend on the water of these large, medium and small irrigation projects. Consider how much water you need to drink. Planning should be done for the use of this project by keeping the required amount of water in the reservoir for drinking. The local bodies should ensure that there is no wastage of water.
8) The government should prepare a shortage action plan for the possible quarters (October to December, January to March and April to June) for 2021-22 and submit it to the government. While formulating the action plan, it should be consciously kept in mind that relatively low cost measures will be proposed which can be availed of during the period of scarcity. There has been a marked difference in the number of measures taken and the actual number of measures taken to address drinking water scarcity in 2020-21. However, the number of proposed measures in the Potential Shortage Action Plan should be accurately reported.
9) Determining the immediate measures to be taken to overcome the drinking water shortage, its cost, its future benefit and implementing those measures Page 3 of 6

Consideration should be given to the time required. While selecting the scarcity mitigation measures, it should be ensured that the cost is minimum considering the available information, duration of scarcity and local conditions. The Collector will have control over the implementation of the scarcity action plan prepared in this way.
10) Drinking water is supplied by tankers, bullock carts in places where other urgent measures cannot be taken. The government's policy is to use government tankers whenever possible. However, it is experienced that whenever the District Collectors ask for tankers to supply drinking water to the field officers of the concerned department, they are often asked to do so.
Tankers which are not in good condition or not in use are supplied. As a result, the district collector is forced to hire private tankers for this work and at the government's expense.
There is a huge increase. Therefore, all the field officers are being strictly instructed to keep the tankers under them in good condition and supply them in a fully functional condition as soon as the Collector demands for supply of drinking water.
(a) by passing an order prohibiting the extraction of water for the purpose of alleviating the scarcity of water in his area; or
If it is found that temporary measures will not solve the shortage permanently, the field system needs to plan and collect information. For this, it is necessary to collect the information about the villages supplied water by tankers in the last five years, list of villages/ villages/ wells by taluk and year, maps of these villages and information about the expenditure on tankers, etc. and prepare a possible scarcity action plan for further planning on that basis. Also, while accepting new tenders and entering into agreements with the tanker owners to control tanker trips while supplying drinking water through tankers.
The condition regarding installation of GPS system on the tanker and maintenance of the system should be fulfilled by the tanker transporter at his own cost.
12) To avoid delay by the Regional Office in approving urgent water supply schemes for drinking water shortage in the urban areas of your division, Reference No. 3 Financial and Physical Page 4 of 6 prescribed as per the provisions of the Government Order

Proposals that do not meet the criteria should be submitted to the government with a strong reason and a clear recommendation. Also, the action plans for possible shortages should be submitted to the government along with the expected expenditure.
13) Care should be taken to ensure that the measures taken under the scarcity programme are completed within the stipulated time, as indicated in the Government Decision at Table 5. So there is no question of extending the deadline.
14) The progress report on the measures taken to solve the water shortage should be sent to the government every Monday by filling the attached statement from 1 to 9.
Quarterly funds should be sought under the head of accounts for rural areas (2215 A 195) and head of accounts for urban areas (2215 A 201) for the measures actually completed to address water scarcity.
Overall, in order to ensure smooth water supply in drinking water scarcity areas and to limit government expenditure on it, care should be taken to strictly follow the above instructions as well as the instructions in the government decision in the above context.
