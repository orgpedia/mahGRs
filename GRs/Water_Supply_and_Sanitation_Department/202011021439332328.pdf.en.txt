a) Village Selection Process: Priority will be given to those villages which have more than 100 households and do not have public toilets.

Toilet construction should take into account the technical aspects such as choosing a site that is suitable for long-term use, the soil for the pit should be conducive for drainage in terms of sewage management, and the site chosen should not be in a deep area.
2) Ensure that the community toilet is comfortable and safe for the group using it.
3) While selecting the site, it should also be ensured that the proposed toilet does not face any difficulty in providing ancillary facilities like water, electricity, etc.
(iv) While selecting the site, suitable sites should be identified for construction of community toilets in the vicinity of the colonies having predominantly SC/ ST population, economically weaker sections and migrant labour population.

On the basis of this proposal, the Deputy Engineer, Rural Water Supply, Sub-Division, Zilla Parishad should prepare a detailed budget for the construction of the complex based on the instructions of the Central Government in the construction of the complex dated June 1, 2020 and June 15, 2020. (4) Considering the topography of the site of the complex and the geographical situation of the village, the budget of the said complex should be prepared on the basis of the district's rate list along with the information as per the accompanying returns 1 and 2 and technical approval should be provided to it. In case the amount required is more than the permissible financial provision for the complex as mentioned in the guidelines at reference No. 1 of the Central Government, the difference amount should be allocated by the Gram Panchayat from the Kruti Sangam.
The proposal having technical sanction should be accorded administrative sanction by the Block Development Officer, Panchayat Samiti. The proposal of the district's consolidated fund demand for the administrative approval proposal should be submitted by the Chief Executive Officer, Zilla Parishad to the State Water and Sanitation Mission, Belapur.
The Deputy Engineer, Rural Water Supply, Sub-Division, Zilla Parishad should prepare the tender form of the administrative approved proposals and implement the tender process according to the Zilla Parishad Account Code and determine the mechanism for the construction of the complex and implement the work.
Construction of Public/ Community Toilets:- On receipt of prior permission for construction of public/ community toilets, the Gram Panchayat may construct public/ community toilet complexes with the help of Taluk level technical machinery. However, the District Water and Sanitation Cell may adopt innovative methods to ensure that the complexes to be constructed in the backdrop of sustainability should be technically sound, construction should be attractive and all the complexes in the district should be of the same pattern. At the district level, a panel can be formed by inviting interested organizations, builders, determining the expected construction rate sheet according to the available options, and following the prescribed government procedures. This option can be made available for construction by sending the list of panels to all the concerned Gram Panchayats.
This method will facilitate quality control of construction.
Technical option for construction of public/ community toilets:- Twin Leach Pit (two suction pit toilets) is the technical option provided for construction of public toilets in the State. This option is inexpensive, easy to use, low water.

Necessary, eco-friendly and extremely convenient in terms of sewage management. This technical option is combined with the corresponding drawing/ type design. Drawing/ type design in respect of technical options mentioned in Annexure 1 Part-II (page 74 of the Guidelines) to the Central Government Guidelines at Reference No. 1 should be considered. Accordingly, according to the district rate list, the rates and description of the items should be changed as per the need, according to the availability of space, according to the geographical location and according to the geo-level of the complex construction site, technically safe and suitable options should be selected and the complex construction budget should be prepared accordingly.
In places where the construction of the above complex is not possible due to geographical location, the construction of such a complex should be proposed with the approval of the Chief Executive Officer, Zilla Parishad, considering that other types of technically sound and fair management will be appropriate.
Provision of funds for construction of public/ community toilets:- A total amount of Rs. 3,00,000/- (Rupees Three Lakhs) has been provided for construction of public/ community toilets. 30% of this amount is Rs. 90,000/- (Rupees Ninety Thousand) is to be provided by the Gram Panchayat from the funds received by the Gram Panchayat through the Fifteenth Finance Commission.

Before making a demand for a public/ community toilet, the concerned Gram Panchayat will get its share from the 15th Finance Commission funds i.e. Rs. 90,000/- (Rupees Ninety Thousand). If the budget is more than the prescribed limit and if the public/ community toilet premises are to be increased, beautified, etc. according to the need in the local area, then the entire expenditure for this will have to be borne by the Gram Panchayat from its own funds/ public participation/ local sources. Details regarding the availability of funds need to be mentioned in the proposal.
Maintenance and Repair Policy: Toilets are expected to be well maintained to keep them clean and usable including water and electricity. For this, the Gram Panchayats should take the help of women self-help groups (SHGs) in the village.
