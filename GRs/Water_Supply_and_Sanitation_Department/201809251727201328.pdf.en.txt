Government Circular: Every year in the state, due to insufficient rainfall or other reasons, there is a shortage of drinking water in rural/ urban areas. In order to avoid any confusion regarding the applications to be taken for drinking water shortage, this Department has issued Reference No. Standing Orders have been issued under Government Decisions 1, 2 and 3. According to the standing orders, the measures taken to address water scarcity will be implemented till June 30. this year in the state.

Although some areas have received good rainfall, some areas have received less than normal rainfall. Considering the possibility of drinking water shortage in such areas in the coming summer, it is necessary to start action immediately in accordance with the instructions in the standing order under the government. The following recommendations are made:
(1) not to permit the digging of any wells for purposes other than the purpose of drinking water within a distance of 500 metres of the sources as per section 21 in the area of influence of public drinking water sources notified under section 20 of the Maharashtra Ground Water (Development and Management) Act, 2009, as well as prohibiting the extraction of ground water from such wells for a reasonable period of time by order of the District Authority if the groundwater depletion in the existing wells in the area of influence is found to be adversely affecting any public drinking water sources as per section 22.
(ii) Urgently take necessary action to take appropriate measures at the proposed minimum cost to mitigate water scarcity in the villages/ hamlets and urban areas as per the local conditions and sources as required.
3) Reference No. 2 As per the decision of the government here, instructions have been prepared to implement preventive measures at the village level to prevent water scarcity in the state. Accordingly, from now on, various measures for water conservation, strengthening of water sources, including Shiv-Kalyan water storage schemes should be taken up.
4) Reference No. 2 As per the instructions given by the government here, the senior geologist, assistant geologist, junior geologist in the Ground Water Survey and Development System will prepare the likely shortage-affected watershed-wise and village-wise plans.

Take it in order. All the districts in the state have received less than 50 per cent of the average rainfall. The water level is 2 meters above average.
It's gone down. A list of such villages should be prepared immediately.
Steps should be taken to ensure that the village gets the benefit of water from the sources of ongoing schemes under the National Rural Drinking Water Programme, Jal Swarajya Phase-2 and Chief Minister's Rural Drinking Water Programme etc. in such villages on a war footing.
6) The District Collector should take necessary action to repair the existing borewells in each district from time to time and keep them in working condition.
7) Many schemes in the district depend on the water of these large, medium and small irrigation projects. Consider how much water you need to drink. Planning should be done for the use of this project by keeping the required amount of water in the reservoir for drinking. The local bodies should ensure that there is no wastage of water.
8) A Potential Water Scarcity Action Plan for the year 2018-19 should be prepared and submitted to the Government with suitable measures for the possible water scarcity affected villages/ hamlets in the State. While formulating the action plan, it should be consciously kept in mind that relatively low cost measures will be proposed which can be availed of during the period of scarcity. There has been a marked difference between the number of measures taken and the actual number of measures taken to address the drinking water shortage in 2017-18. However, the number of proposed measures in the Potential Shortage Action Plan should be accurately reported.
9) While deciding on the immediate measures to be taken to overcome the drinking water shortage, the cost incurred, its future benefit and the time taken to implement those measures should be considered. While selecting the scarcity mitigation measures, it should be ensured that the cost is minimum considering the available information, duration of scarcity and local conditions. like this

The Collector will be in charge of the implementation of the scarcity action plan.
10) Drinking water is supplied by tankers, bullock carts in places where other urgent measures cannot be taken. The government's policy is to use government tankers whenever possible. However, it is experienced that whenever the District Collectors ask for tankers to supply drinking water to the field officers of the concerned department, they are often asked to do so.
Tankers which are not in good condition or not in use are supplied. As a result, the district collector is forced to hire private tankers for this work and at the government's expense.
There is a huge increase. Therefore, all the field officers are being strictly instructed to keep the tankers under them in good condition and supply them in a fully functional condition as soon as the Collector demands for supply of drinking water.
(a) by passing an order prohibiting the extraction of water for the purpose of alleviating the scarcity of water in his area; or
If it is found that temporary measures will not solve the shortage permanently, the field system needs to plan and collect information. For the last five
It is necessary to prepare a possible scarcity action plan for further planning by collecting information such as taluk and year-wise list of villages/ hamlets supplied water by tankers during the year, maps of these villages and information about the expenditure on tankers. Also, while accepting new tenders and entering into agreements with the tanker owners to control tanker trips while supplying drinking water through tankers.
The condition regarding installation of GPS system on the tanker and maintenance of the system should be fulfilled by the tanker transporter at his own cost.
12) To avoid delay by the Regional Office in approving urgent water supply schemes for drinking water shortage in the urban areas of your division, Reference No. 3 Proposals which do not meet the financial and physical criteria prescribed under the provisions of the Government Decision should be submitted to the Government with a strong reason and a clear recommendation. Also, the action plans for possible shortages should be submitted to the government along with the expected expenditure.

Water supply should be streamlined in areas where there is drinking water shortage.
In order to limit the government expenditure, the above suggestions and the government decision in the above context
Be sure to follow the instructions carefully.
