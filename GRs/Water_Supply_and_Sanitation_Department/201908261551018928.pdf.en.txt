Preamble: Under the National Rural Drinking Water Programme, the schemes of the Central and State Governments to solve the drinking water problem in rural areas are implemented in the form of a demand-driven policy. These include regional water supply schemes as well as separate water supply schemes.
The general assessment of regional and separate water supply schemes is as follows.
For separate water supply scheme, the source of water is taken from near/ far and geological source.
The ground water is available only for about 9 months under a separate scheme and often the water is chemically contaminated. At times, women have to fetch water from wells and hand pumps and spend their precious time for this. This results in less water supply in summer or during periods of scarcity. The origin of regional water supply scheme is terrestrial and sustainable in nature. The villages included in such regional plan get assured good and pure water. Since the geographical origin of the separate scheme is far away, it becomes very difficult and unaffordable for a village to maintain and repair the separate scheme. If three to four nearby villages are combined to form a regional water supply scheme, the cost of maintenance and repair is divided.
But the water table rate of a regional water supply scheme may be higher.
In some places, there are problems in getting water from the regional water supply scheme. Due to these reasons, the government receives proposals from the regional offices or public representatives seeking separate schemes out of many regional water supply schemes (closed or ongoing).
As per the situation, it is appropriate to give approval to the villages under the Regional Water Supply Scheme to implement a separate scheme. However, since such proposals are not absolute, these proposals are subjected to rigorous scrutiny at the government level.

It was difficult to do. In view of this, it is very important to submit a complete proposal for providing a separate water supply scheme from the Regional Water Supply Scheme. Following instructions have been issued in this regard:
Government Circular: While submitting a proposal to the Government to implement a separate water supply scheme for the villages under the Regional Water Supply Scheme, it will be mandatory to include the following items in the proposal.
1. Full details of the original regional plan 1. Source of water.
Date of commencement/ implementation of the scheme.
(iii) the year/ period.
4) How much water is provided each day?
V. Implementing system.
(vi) Status of transfer/ disinvestment of the scheme and the year in which it was made.
List of all included villages. (including population) 7. Proportion of recovery from the scheme (Village wise IX. The current status of the project. (On/ Off Scheme) Details including 2. Details of origination of the scheme. Availability of water. quality of water supply.
Current and projected annual water demand.
4. Information about the villages which are demanding separate schemes 5. Information about alternative drinking water supply in the villages.
6. Impact of separate tap water supply scheme for village on regional tap water supply scheme.
7. Impact of separate tap water supply scheme for villages on the water table of Regional Tap Water Supply Scheme.
8. Comparison report of the two works of making or repairing new tap water supply scheme.
Maps and Google Maps of the proposed and existing tap water supply schemes (it is mandatory to view the entire scheme). Also, the names of the surrounding villages should be clearly mentioned. )
