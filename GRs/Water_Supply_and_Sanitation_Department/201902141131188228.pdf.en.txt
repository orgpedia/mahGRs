Circular: In view of the scarcity of drinking water, such instructions have been given to all concerned through various government decisions and circulars. These instructions should be strictly implemented by all the field officers. With a view to bring to the notice of all the field officers once again, the following suggestions have been given: (9) The demand for drinking water in the villages where fodder camps have been set up by the Revenue and Forest Department should be included in the demand for drinking water for the cattle in the fodder camps and water should be supplied through tankers as per requirement.

(2) Plastic/ Fibre water storage tanks will be provided to villages facing drinking water shortage under CSR by private agencies. Arrangements should be made to fill the water received from the tanker in the storage tank, a cauldron to install the storage tank and two to five taps should be connected to each tank. The gram panchayat should arrange it from its own funds.
(3) The purity of water supplied by tankers should be checked by the Water Safety Guard. Also, make sure to purify the water by adding medicines like TCL powder, potassium permanganate, etc. The gram panchayat should also ensure that the water tankers supplied are clean.
(4) The concerned Extension Officer, Panchayat Samiti should be given the responsibility to ensure that the water from the drinking water tankers reaches the respective villages adequately.
(4) The District Collector is required to inform the media representatives every week about the action taken at the district level in connection with the shortage of drinking water.
(6) The consolidated information regarding the total sanctioned schemes, completed schemes, schemes in progress and expenditure incurred on them for the purpose of drinking water scarcity should be sent to the Government on the last day of every week in the attached statement.
