This should be recorded in the report. Such officers will be liable for disciplinary action as the act violates Rule 3 (3) and Rule 23 of the Maharashtra Civil Services (Conduct) Rules, 1979.
Since these transfers are required to be effected effectively, the salary of all the transferred officers up to 31st May, 2018 shall be drawn by the office in which they are presently working. All the heads of the departments and offices of the Ground Water Survey and Development Agency are being instructed to ensure that the salary due from June 1, 2018, is paid by the Drawing and Disbursing Officer of the office where the concerned officer was working before the transfer.
It may be noted that if the transferred officers are not relieved by 31/05/2018 (M.N.), action will be taken to relieve the concerned officers unilaterally by the Water Supply and Sanitation Department.
