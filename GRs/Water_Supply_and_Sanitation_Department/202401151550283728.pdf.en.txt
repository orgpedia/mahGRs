Introduction :-
Groundwater is the backbone of India's agriculture and drinking water security. It 1s
a common-pool resource, used by millions of farmers across the country and remains the only drinking water source in most of India's rural households. It also supports industrial water demand in many cases. The Scarcity of water resources and ever-increasing demands that are placed on the resource underline the importance of identifying, quantifying and
management of groundwater to offset the problems of over-extraction and contamination
and to obviate the consequent economic loss or environmental damage while balancing the demand for various uses. Revisiting aquifers by understanding them better through the
aquifer mapping programme with a clear-cut forward link a participatory groundwater management is desired.
The proposed National Project on Aquifer Management (NAQUIM) is designed to
make a significant step forward in ground water resources management by identifying and mapping aquifers, quantifying the available ground water resources potential and proposing
plans appropriate to the scale of demand, aquifer characteristics and the institutional
arrangements for management.
It also deals with the detailed implementation strategy and the mechanism for participatory ground water management at the grass root level as an integral part of the scheme proposal to be implemented in XII & XIII five-year plan period.
The Government of India desires association of the State Government in the National
Project on Aquifer Management for effective implementation of the programme. In order to
