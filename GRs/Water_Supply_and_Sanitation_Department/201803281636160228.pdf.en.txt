Introduction- Considering the geological and natural structure of the state of Maharashtra and the diverse conditions of rainfall, the importance of groundwater reserves for meeting the drinking water needs is unique.
It is very important to monitor the quality of water. A chemical laboratory was established in Pune in 1977 under the Ground Water Survey and Development Scheme to test the quality of groundwater. Considering the huge increase in the scope of work, in the year 1987, Divisional Laboratories were established at Pune, Amravati, Nagpur, Aurangabad, Nashik and Konkan.
138 Sub-Divisional Laboratories under the control of Public Health Department have been transferred to Director, Ground Water Survey and Development System, Pune.
