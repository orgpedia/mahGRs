Government circular:
The State Government has adopted a people-oriented policy of demand-based public participation for the implementation of the rural water supply programme. Since 2009-10, the programme has been renamed as National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP). As per the guidelines of the Central Government, guidelines for rural water supply programme have been issued from time to time to improve the implementation of rural water supply programme in the State.
For separate water supply schemes meeting the per capita expenditure criteria under the Rural Water Supply Programme, the Gram Sabhas have been allocated Rs. 50.00 lakhs and for separate/ regional water supply schemes, Rs. Administrative sanction of up to Rs. 5.00 crore has been accorded. However, due to lack of adequate manpower or technical/ administrative capacity of the local bodies (mainly Gram Panchayats) while giving administrative approval, many water supply schemes were not being properly scrutinized, they were being approved and administrative approval of the schemes at the district level was being delayed.

Accordingly, the following directions are being issued regarding the proposal for revised administrative approval to tap water supply schemes: 1) If the cost of the original sanctioned scheme is going to increase due to technical changes in the overall component of the original sanctioned scheme, it is mandatory to take prior approval of the Government. If not, then responsibility should be fixed on the concerned.
(2) If for any reason technical changes are required to be made in the original sanctioned plan, the changes should be made only with the prior permission of the authorities competent to grant technical approval subject to the original sanctioned cost.
3) It should be checked that it is possible to supply water by connecting individual/ household taps according to the 55 LPCD criterion per person.
4) What is the total number of houses currently under the IMIS system? How many of these homes have a water connection? What are the plans to connect the remaining houses to the tap? All this should be included in the plan. A decision in this regard will be taken by the gram panchayat.
(5) If the tender cannot be made for more than 2 years from the date of administrative approval, the price of the scheme should be taken out of the new prevailing price and then the tender should be made.
6) The proposals for post-facto approval are submitted without prior approval of the tenderers of the excess rate, however, the possibility of the cost of the scheme exceeding 15% cannot be ruled out. Accordingly, post-facto approval cannot be granted only in certain circumstances. However, work orders should not be issued without the approval of the tender for the excess rate. Please note that the executive engineer will be fully responsible for this.
