7th Floor, Gokuldas Tejpal Hospital Building, Near Crawford Market, New Mantralaya, Lokmanya Tilak Marg, Mumbai- 400 001
Date: January 24, 2022.
Government Resolution No: Apna-1097/ P.No. 147/ Papu-15D Preamble 30th June, 1999 Under the decision of the Government in the context dated 30th June, 1999, Rs. 1000 and 1500 respectively. Since there has been no increase in the above survey fee for a long time, it was under consideration to increase the survey fee and also to fix the fee for the incoming test. It was contemplated to prescribe the fee for the survey to be carried out either by the Geologist/ Geophysicist of the Ground Water Survey and Development Agency or by a private service provider. Considering the limited manpower in the Ground Water Survey and Development System, which limits the immediate completion of ground water survey for government schemes of private or other departments, the matter was under consideration to provide suggestions regarding the availability of services of private service providers in order to provide facilities for conducting ground water survey in case of urgency.
Government's decision
As per the Government decision dated 30th June, 1999, the prescribed fee is being revised and the revised fee for survey by Geologists/ Geophysicists of Ground Water Survey and Development Agency will be as follows:
