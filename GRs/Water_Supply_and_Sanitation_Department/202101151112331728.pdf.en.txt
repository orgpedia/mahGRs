The Proposal:
The Central and State Governments are providing funds to the Urban Local Bodies for various Central Government and State Government sponsored Urban Water Supply and Sewerage Schemes being implemented in the State. Financial participation of Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) has been made mandatory while approving urban water supply and sewerage schemes and as per 74th Amendment to the Constitution, water supply and sewerage schemes are implemented by the respective ULBs on demand based public participation.
In order to provide technical services to urban local bodies under various schemes of the Central and State Governments, including technical evaluation of proposals, preparation of project proposals, technical supervision of work and inspection of work by third parties, etc., the service charge of Maharashtra Life Authority shall be deducted from the service charge. The amendment was made under the Government Resolution dated February 22, 2011. However, the Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran and various departments levy a fee ranging from 5 to 7 per cent for water supply and sewerage pipeline relocation work. Since there is a need to rationalize all the systems regarding this fee, Ma. Minister of State (Road Transport and Highways) The Chief Minister presided over the meeting. In the review meeting held on 5.3.2020, on 16.7.2020.
