Introduction: The Accountant General had raised objections that fluoride removal units (DFU) were not in use for some time in some places in the state. There was also a delay in timely supply of purified water to fluoride affected villages due to non-installation of defluoridation units on time. The Public Accounts Committee has recommended that there should be proper regulation of installation and operation of defluoridation units/ water purification systems.
The government was contemplating to take steps in this regard.
Government Circular: RO units or defloridation units are being installed through Jal Jeevan Mission/ National Rural Drinking Water Scheme/ Jal Swarajya and other similar schemes. However, due to planning errors, the commissioning of the water purification system is unnecessarily delayed after procurement. Alternatively, the citizens of the concerned places are deprived of such basic facilities, to avoid these matters, the following suggestions are being given.
1) The basic facilities such as space for water purification systems, electricity supply, etc. should be first verified and proposals/ demands should be made regularly from the local body concerned.
The concerned Executive Engineer, Rural Water Supply Department, Zilla Parishad should take necessary action in accordance with the terms and conditions of the tender for the early operationalization of the system and report the action taken to the Mission Director, State Water and Sanitation Mission by 8th of every month.

(3) The Mission Director, State Water Sanitation Mission shall make necessary controls for the operation of the water purification system within the prescribed time as per the terms and conditions of the tender.
The concerned CEOs and Zila Parishads should be given instructions from time to time to address the problems arising at the local level.
4) The Deputy Chief Executive Officer (Water and Sanitation) and the Executive Engineer, Rural Water Supply Department, Zilla Parishad should inspect the water purification system in the district at least twice a year through the Deputy Engineer from the Zilla Parishad level to ensure that the system is in order.
