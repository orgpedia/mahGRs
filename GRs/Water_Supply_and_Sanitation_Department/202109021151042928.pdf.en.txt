is being done. The order is a discharge order and no fresh order is required to be issued by the concerned office.
The transferred officers should immediately join the office mentioned in Rakana No. 4 and submit the report to the government through the Director, Ground Water Survey and Development System without delay. If it is found that the transferred officers have not joined the place of transfer, disciplinary action will be taken against them under the provisions of the Maharashtra Civil Services (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1979. The transferred officers should be reinstated immediately. The head of the office and the establishment officer concerned will be held responsible if there is a case of non-payment of salary and allowances due to non-recruitment of an officer without fixing a mandatory waiting period.
(3) The officers being posted under the said order shall be required to join immediately at the place of their posting. If any officer fails to appear at the place of posting or tries to directly or indirectly pressurize the officer to change the transfer order, it should be recorded in the confidential report of the concerned officer. Such officers will be liable for disciplinary action as the act violates Rule 3 (3) and Rule 23 of the Maharashtra Civil Services (Conduct) Rules, 1979.

The salary from 03/09/2021 should not be withdrawn from the pre-transfer office under any circumstances. After the concerned officer arrives at the transfer office, the post-transfer office should deduct the salary and submit a report to the government. Instructions are being issued to all Heads of Departments and Heads of Offices in the Ground Water Survey and Development System that they will be held personally liable if the salary due from 03/09/2021 is paid by the Drawing and Disbursing Officer in the office where they were working before the transfer.
Since the above transfers are being made on the request of the concerned, they will not be allowed to join the place of their transfer during the period of assumption of office and any kind of travelling allowance or incidental allowances.
