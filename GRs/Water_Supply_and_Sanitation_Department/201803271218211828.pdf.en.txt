However, in cases where sustainable surface resources like rivers, dams, ponds, etc. are available and permanent water is available, the works of sub-group-1 and sub-group-2 can be taken up together as per the government's priority.
For the implementation of the Chief Minister's Rural Drinking Water Programme within the prescribed time frame and effectively, the government was considering to grant permission to take the works of sub-division-1 and sub-division-2 together, and to approve the technical changes in the budget of the approved water supply schemes to the Member Secretary, Majipra (for the schemes to be implemented through Majipra) and the Chief Engineer, Majipra, Regional Department (for the schemes to be implemented through the Zilla Parishad).
