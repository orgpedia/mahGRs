Government Resolution No: Swachhata-2022/ PR No. 05/ PAPU-02
7th Floor, Gokuldas Tejpal Hospital Complex,
Lokmanya Tilak Marg, Mantralaya, Mumbai- 400 001
Date: December 13, 2023.
The Proposal:
The water supply and sanitation department is carrying out renovation work. As a result, a lot of dust and debris is generated. Also, due to climate change, the dust is spreading everywhere in the region. Therefore, the possibility of dust accumulation on tables, chairs, computers, printers and files cannot be ruled out. At the same time, the department is in the process of implementing the Jal Jeevan Mission and Swachh Bharat Mission. Under this Under the chairmanship of the Principal Secretary, meetings, project presentations and seminars with senior officers of the department are being held frequently.
In the above situation, as part of cleanliness, it has become necessary to maintain cleanliness in the department for some time. The matter of appointing a private agency for cleaning independently by the department/ department was under the consideration of the government as the ongoing sanitation works were becoming inadequate or unsatisfactory and it would not be possible to hold senior level meetings or planned activities in such places.
Government Decision: In the Water Supply and Sanitation Department, two IAS officers of the department are working on the 7th and 8th floor. Administrative approval is being given to appoint a maximum of four employees (to be increased as per requirement) to clean their hall, renovated area in the department, ongoing renovation and other areas. Accordingly, the following activities and services are required to be provided.
