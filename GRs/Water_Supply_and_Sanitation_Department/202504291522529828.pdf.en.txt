Conditions
The CEO / Chief Engineer will be responsible for completing all the remaining works within the prescribed time frame at the above mentioned revised cost.
The original administrative approval agreed upon for the scheme as well as the terms and conditions mentioned while granting the technical approval should be strictly adhered to.
Once the scheme is completed, it should be handed over to the concerned Gram Panchayat. The concerned Gram Panchayat / Zilla Parishad shall be responsible for taking over the scheme within one month from the date of receipt of the intimation from the concerned Executive Engineer, Rural Water Supply Department, Zila Parishad that the scheme has actually been completed. Immediately after the actual completion of the scheme, a joint inspection of the scheme should be conducted by the concerned Executive Engineer, Zilla Parishad and concerned Gram Panchayat officials and any defects found in such inspection should be corrected before handing over the scheme.
The Gram Panchayat / Zilla Parishad concerned shall not receive any assistance from the Government for implementation of the scheme, maintenance, repairs (subject to special modifications), depreciation in the scheme or renovation of machinery to meet the annual expenditure.
On completion of the scheme, it will be mandatory for the local body (concerned Gram Panchayat / Zilla Parishad) to transfer the scheme. The accounts of the scheme should also be closed.
According to a CAG report in 2013, 29% of the water supply schemes in the state have been shut down due to lack of maintenance repairs and non-payment of electricity charges (Poor maintenance / non-payment of electricity of 7.8%). Hence, in order to make the scheme financially viable, it will be the responsibility of the concerned Gram Panchayat / Zilla Parishad to increase the water tariff as per requirement.
Action should be taken in accordance with the prevailing policy on extortion.
It shall be the responsibility of the Zilla Parishad to ensure that the present scheme is not revised under any circumstances.
Since administrative expenditure is not permissible under Jal Jeevan PRM, it should be excluded if 4% of the administrative expenditure has been taken up in the revised budget of the scheme.
