The proposal-
To solve the drinking water problem in rural areas of the state, the Water Supply and Sanitation Department was implementing various schemes under the demand-based policy of the central government as well as the state government, as well as externally funded measures such as Jal Swarojya Project, National Rural Drinking Water Programme, Chief Minister Rural Drinking Water Programme. To strengthen the sources of water supply, measures are being taken under the Shivakal Water Storage Scheme as well as the Maharashtra Ground Water Act. The State Government has adopted a demand based public participation policy for implementation of rural water supply programme. As per the policy, the demand, planning, implementation and maintenance of rural tap water supply schemes is to be done by the concerned local bodies. This is being done through the District Water Supply and Sanitation Committees of the Zila Parishads and Gram Panchayats. Some of the regional water supply schemes are also being implemented by Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran. While implementing this policy, it has been observed that the implementation process needs to be strengthened in a time-bound manner and the rural population should be provided with sustainable and adequate water supply.
As per the revised guidelines of the Central Government, the National Rural Drinking Water Programme has been converted into Jal Jeevan Mission and since 04/09/2020, the Jal Jeevan Mission programme is being implemented in the State as per the instructions of the Central Government. Under this programme, the objective of" Har Ghar Nal Se Jal" is to be achieved and the Mission focuses on" Functional Household Tap Connections (FHTCs)." Each house must have a sustainable water supply to meet the goal of a functional household tap connection with a volume of 55 liters per day.
The Jal Jeevan Mission is an ambitious programme of the Government of India, which aims to complete the project by 2024. The programme is being implemented across the state. When implementing water supply schemes, it is often difficult to implement the projects as the land required for the project is not available.

As there is no provision of land acquisition in the Jal Jeevan Mission program, in this regard, the Maharashtra Jeevan Authority has proposed to provide government lands required for various water supply schemes under the Jal Jeevan Mission Mission without any cost. 3 and 4 were submitted to the government. According to the proposal, land under various departments will be required for the sub-sectors of rural tap water supply schemes and it has been proposed to give approval to make these lands available for rural tap water supply schemes free of cost. It was presented in the cabinet meeting on 29/12/2022. The proposal had been approved by the Cabinet and a decision in this regard would be taken by the Government.
Government Decision- As Jal Jeevan Mission is an ambitious and time-bound programme, if the implementing agency of the water supply scheme demands land under other government departments/ local bodies for the rural water supply schemes, the concerned department/ local body should immediately provide a No Objection Certificate for the use of rural water supply schemes without transferring the ownership rights for the said land.
Since the Water Supply and Sewerage Scheme is also being implemented by the Urban Development Department, this decision of the Government will also be applicable for the schemes of Amrit and Nagaroththan of the Urban Development Department.
Since the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 provides for certain exemptions in respect of diversion of forest land for purposes such as drinking water pipelines, the Forest Department shall take a decision on the demand for land belonging to the Forest Department on the basis of the provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980; the Indian Forest Act, 1927 and the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, and on a case-to-case basis. The Department of Finance has issued Informal Reference No. 127, c. The Government has approved the said decision vide 05/01/2023.
