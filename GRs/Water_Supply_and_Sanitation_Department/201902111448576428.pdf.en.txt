The Government has decided to provide Rs. 50.00 lakh and for separate/ regional water supply schemes, Rs. Administrative sanction of up to Rs 5 crore has been granted. However, it has come to the notice of the Government that due to lack of adequate manpower or technical/ administrative capabilities of the local bodies (mainly Gram Panchayats) in giving administrative approval, many water supply schemes are not being properly scrutinized and are being approved and administrative approval of schemes at the district level is delayed. Accordingly, the government was considering amending the administrative approval of the Gram Sabha, the right to accept tenders and the right to administrative approval of the District Water Management Committee.
Similarly, on the lines of the Chief Minister's Rural Drinking Water Scheme, the government was considering to bring about a balance between technical approval, administrative approval, enforcement powers, and tender acceptance powers.
GOVERNMENT DECISIONS: The following amendments are being made in the technical approval, administrative approval, powers of implementation and powers of acceptance of tenders provided under the Government Decisions issued from time to time in respect of rural water supply schemes in the State.
a) Rights of Technical Approval: The rights of technical approval as mentioned in the table below are being conferred upon the concerned competent authorities.
