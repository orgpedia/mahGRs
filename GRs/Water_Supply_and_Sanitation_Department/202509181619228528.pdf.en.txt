The original administrative approval agreed upon for the scheme as well as the terms and conditions mentioned while granting the technical approval should be strictly adhered to.
Once the scheme is completed, it should be handed over to the concerned Gram Panchayat. The concerned Gram Panchayat / Zilla Parishad shall be responsible for taking over the scheme within one month from the date of receipt of the intimation from the concerned Executive Engineer, Rural Water Supply Department, Zila Parishad that the scheme has actually been completed. Immediately after the actual completion of the scheme, a joint inspection of the scheme should be conducted by the concerned Executive Engineer, Zilla Parishad and concerned Gram Panchayat officials and if any defects are found in the inspection, they should be corrected before handing over the scheme.
The Gram Panchayat / Zilla Parishad concerned shall not receive any assistance from the Government for meeting the recurring expenditure incurred annually for implementation, maintenance, repairs (including special modifications), depreciation in the scheme or renovation of machinery.
On completion of the scheme, it will be mandatory for the local body (concerned Gram Panchayat / Zilla Parishad) to transfer the scheme. The accounts of the scheme should also be closed.
According to a CAG report in 2013, 21 per cent of water supply schemes in the state have fallen due to poor maintenance / non-payment of electricity bills due to lack of maintenance repairs. Hence, in order to make the scheme financially viable, it will be the responsibility of the concerned Gram Panchayat / Zilla Parishad to increase the water tariff as per requirement.

The District Council shall be responsible for ensuring that the present scheme is not revised under any circumstances.
Since administrative expenditure is not permissible under Jal Jeevan FR, it should be excluded if 4 per cent of the administrative expenditure has been taken up in the revised budget of the scheme.
It should be ensured at the Zilla Parishad level that the tender process of the 10.सदर scheme is properly carried out.
