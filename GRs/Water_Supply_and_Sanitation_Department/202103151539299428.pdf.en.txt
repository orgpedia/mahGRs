Preamble: Shahpara (North) Regional Water Supply Scheme, Ta. The original administrative approval has been given to the budget of the tap water supply scheme in Pen, G. Raigad under reference number 1. Reference No. 2 has approved the differential cost of the scheme from 40 litres to 55 litres.
The original technical approval to the budget has been granted by the Chief Engineer, Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran, Thane under reference number 3. The cost of the scheme has increased due to the acceptance of the tender for the work of the scheme and the high-pressure power line had to be brought from a distance of four km, which cost more than the original provision. The Chief Engineer, Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran, Thane has given the revised technical approval to the plan budget under reference number 4. Accordingly, the Chief Engineer, Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran, Thane, had submitted a proposal to the government under reference letter No. 5 and 6 to give revised administrative approval to the plan and budget of the present tap water supply scheme. Accordingly, the matter of giving revised administrative approval to the plan and budget of the present scheme was under consideration of the Government.
