Government Circular: Every year in the state due to insufficient rainfall or other reasons, there is a shortage of drinking water in rural/ urban areas. In order to avoid any confusion regarding the applications to be taken for drinking water shortage, this Department has issued Reference No. 1, 2 and 3.

The decision has been taken as per the government order. According to the standing order, the measures taken to address water scarcity are implemented till June 30. This year's rainfall has been below average in some areas. Considering the possibility of shortage of drinking water in such areas in the coming summer, it is necessary to start action immediately in accordance with the instructions in the standing order under the government. The following recommendations are made:
(1) not to permit the digging of any wells for purposes other than the purpose of drinking water within a distance of 500 metres of the sources as per section 21 in the area of influence of public drinking water sources notified under section 20 of the Maharashtra Ground Water (Development and Management) Act, 2009, as well as prohibiting the extraction of ground water from such wells for a reasonable period of time by order of the District Authority if the groundwater depletion in the existing wells in the area of influence is found to be adversely affecting any public drinking water sources as per section 22.
(ii) Urgently take necessary action to take appropriate measures at the proposed minimum cost to mitigate water scarcity in the villages/ hamlets and urban areas as per the local conditions and sources as required.
3) Reference No. 2 As per the decision of the government here, instructions have been prepared to implement preventive measures at the village level to prevent water scarcity in the state. Accordingly, a programme should be launched to implement various measures for water conservation and strengthening of water sources from now on.
4) Reference No. 2 Senior Geologist, Assistant Geologist, Junior Geologist in the Ground Water Survey and Development System as per the instructions given under the Government Decision here.

The works of preparing watershed-wise and village-wise plans should be taken up on priority. All the districts in the state have received less than 50 per cent of the average rainfall. The water level is 2 metres below the average. A list of such villages should be prepared immediately.
Steps should be taken to ensure that the water sources of the ongoing schemes under the Jal Jeevan Mission program and schemes in such villages are completed on a war footing and the benefit of water is available to the village at the earliest.
6) The District Collector should take necessary action to repair the existing borewells in each district from time to time and keep them in working condition.
7) Many schemes in the district depend on the water of these large, medium and small irrigation projects. Consider how much water you need to drink. Planning should be done for the use of this project by keeping the required amount of water in the reservoir for drinking. The local bodies should ensure that there is no wastage of water.
8) The appropriate measures for the possible water scarcity affected villages/ hamlets in the state should be prepared and submitted to the government for the possible quarter (October to December, January to March and April to June) shortage action plan for the year 2023-24. While formulating the action plan, it should be consciously kept in mind that relatively low cost measures will be proposed which can be availed of during the period of scarcity. A significant difference has been observed between the number of measures taken and the actual number of measures taken to address drinking water scarcity in 2022-23. However, the number of proposed measures in the Potential Shortage Action Plan should be accurately reported.
9) While deciding on the immediate measures to be taken to overcome the drinking water shortage, the cost incurred, its future benefit and the time taken to implement those measures should be considered. While selecting the scarcity mitigation measures, it should be ensured that the cost is minimum considering the available information, duration of scarcity and local conditions. like this

The Collector will be in charge of the implementation of the scarcity action plan prepared.
10) Drinking water is supplied by tankers, bullock carts in places where other urgent measures cannot be taken. The government's policy is to use government tankers whenever possible to supply water through tankers. However, it has been experienced that whenever the District Collectors ask for tankers from the field officers of the concerned department for supply of drinking water, they are often provided with tankers which are not in good condition or not in use. As a result, the district collector is forced to hire private tankers for this work and the government expenditure increases significantly. Therefore, all the field officers are being strictly instructed to keep the tankers under them in good condition and supply them in a fully functional condition as soon as the Collector demands for supply of drinking water.
11) If it is found that the permanent shortage will not be solved by issuing a ban order or taking temporary measures to solve the water shortage in your department, the zonal system must plan and collect information. For this, it is necessary to collect information about the villages that have been supplied water by tankers in the last five years, list of villages/ wadis by taluk and year, maps of these villages and information about the expenditure on tankers, etc. Also, while accepting new tenders and entering into agreements with the tanker owners to control the tanker trips while supplying drinking water through tankers, the condition of installing GPS system on the tanker and maintenance of the same by the tanker transporter at his own cost should be fulfilled.
12) To avoid the delay by the Regional Office in approving the urgent water supply schemes for the drinking water shortage in the urban areas of your division, Reference No. 3 Proposals which do not meet the financial and physical criteria prescribed under the provisions of the Government Decision shall be submitted to the Government with sound reasons and clear recommendations. Also, the action plans for possible shortages should be submitted to the government along with the expected expenditure.

13) Care should be taken to ensure that the measures taken under the scarcity programme are completed within the stipulated time, as indicated in the Government Decision at Table 5. So there is no question of extending the deadline.
14) The progress report on the measures taken to solve the water shortage should be sent to the government every Monday by filling the attached statement from 1 to 9.
Come.
Quarterly funds should be sought under the head of accounts for rural areas (2215 A 195) and head of accounts for urban areas (2215 A 201) for the measures actually completed to address water scarcity.
Overall, in order to ensure smooth water supply in drinking water scarcity areas and to limit government expenditure on it, care should be taken to strictly follow the above instructions as well as the instructions in the government decision in the above context.
