This should be recorded in the report. Such officers will be liable for disciplinary action as the act violates Rule 3 (3) and Rule 23 of the Maharashtra Civil Services (Conduct) Rules, 1979.
Since these transfers are required to be effected effectively, the salary of all the transferred officers as on 11/11/2020 should be drawn by the office in which they are presently working. The salary from 12/11/2020 should not be withdrawn from the pre-transfer office under any circumstances. After the concerned officer arrives at the transfer office, the post-transfer office should deduct the salary and submit a report to the government. Instructions are being issued to all Heads of Departments and Heads of Offices in the Ground Water Survey and Development System that they will be held personally liable if the salary due from 12/11/2020 is paid by the Drawing and Disbursing Officer of the office in which they were working before the transfer.
Since the above transfers are being made on the request of the concerned, they will not be allowed to join the place of their transfer during the period of assumption of office and any kind of travelling allowance or incidental allowances.
These orders will come into force with immediate effect. The Director, Ground Water Survey and Development Agency is being informed to submit the information to the government immediately as to whether the concerned officers have joined the office of the transferred officer or how.
