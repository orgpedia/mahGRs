Water Supply and Sanitation Department, Government Resolution No: Ground Water- 1820/ PR No.34/ Papu-15D. 26/11/2020.
Preamble The Government has issued a decision dated 26/11/2020 regarding implementation of Central Government and World Bank sponsored Atal Bhujal Yojana in the State from 2020-21 to 2024-25.
The scheme is being implemented to improve the quality and availability of groundwater in 1443 villages of 1339 Gram Panchayats in 13 districts of the state. The scheme is expected to achieve the objectives of the scheme through the convergence of schemes being implemented by the Departments of Soil and Water Conservation, Water Resources, Agriculture, etc. Since the present scheme is based on the target achievement index and the State Government will receive the incentive subsidy as per the target achievement criteria, active participation of all other concerned departments including the Ground Water Survey and Development Mechanism is expected. Considering these issues, the government was considering the formation of taluk-level coordination committees to maintain coordination between the implementing offices at the taluk level of various departments.
