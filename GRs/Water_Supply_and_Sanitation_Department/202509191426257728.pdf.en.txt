1) The CEO / Chief Engineer will be responsible for completing all the remaining works within the prescribed time frame at the above mentioned revised cost.
2) The original administrative approval agreed upon for the scheme as well as the terms and conditions mentioned while granting the revised technical approval should be strictly adhered to.
3) On completion of the scheme, it should be handed over to the concerned Gram Panchayat. The concerned Gram Panchayat / Zilla Parishad shall be responsible for taking over the scheme within one month from the date of receipt of intimation from the concerned Executive Engineer, Rural Water Supply Department, Zila Parishad that the scheme has actually been completed.
