The decision has been taken by the government.
However, there is a need to increase the scope of quality testing through FTK of drinking water sources under the Jal Jeevan Mission programme and to bring about speed in this work. Also, the Central Govt. The Gram Panchayats/ Village Water& Sanitation Committees/ Pani Samitis have been advised to conduct at least one nuclear biopsy of drinking water sources/ samples at delivery points every month and record the same on WQMIS website.

b) Five women from the local community should be selected under each Gram Panchayat through the Gram Panchayat and its sub-committees, water use groups. They should be trained by the concerned Zilla Parishad to conduct water quality testing through Field Test Kits (FTK) in collaboration with Bhujal Survekshan and Development Karyakartas, Pune and to create awareness in terms of water quality.
Water samples from all the identified registered drinking water sources/ distribution points should be tested for water quality for the following components through Biological FTK-HRS vials once every month by trained women volunteers in the village.

| 1.   | Bacteriological Fit/ Unfit for  |  consumption | Biologically unsuitable for drinking water |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The water quality report of the registered water source/ distribution points inspected by the biological FTK-H2S vials in the Gram Panchayat should be prepared by the trained women volunteers with the help of the water conservator and Gramsevak as given in Sample 1 and submitted to the concerned Ghat Development Officer, Panchayat Samiti in the prescribed format (Sample 1) attached with the signature of the Gramsevak.
