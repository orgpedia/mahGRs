Government order:
As per the government order. Petition No. 2797/2015 pending in the High Court. The ad-hoc promotions to the posts lying vacant in the open category were given purely on a temporary basis under the judgments in 2982/2000, 2986/2000 and 3958/2003 and other connected petitions. Since these promotions are in the quota of promotions and the reasons for granting ad-hoc promotions have been dispensed with, these promotions are being temporarily regularized.
