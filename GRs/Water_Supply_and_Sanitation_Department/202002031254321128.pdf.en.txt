It is a loan. However, after the formation of Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran (formerly Maharashtra Water Supply and Sewerage Board) in 1977, the responsibility of the loan of the Life Insurance Corporation was transferred to the Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran. Under reference As per the procedure laid down under the Government Order dated 7th March, 1977, the instalments due to the Life Insurance Corporation on 1st June and 1st December every year are paid by the Maharashtra Life Authority. The grant sanctioned to the Maharashtra Life Authority is considered as a loan. Under reference The Maharashtra Life Authority will recover the loan from the municipality in the next 20 years on the same terms and conditions as the municipalities had borrowed from the Life Insurance Corporation as per the government decision of June 8, 1968.
However, the loan was not repaid to the Life Insurance Corporation of India as the loan from the municipalities (Life Insurance Corporation of India and loans taken by the Municipalities from the Government) was not repaid in full and the amount to be repaid to the Life Insurance Corporation of India was adjusted against penal interest in the first place. However, it was under consideration of the Government to disburse the provision available to the Life Insurance Corporation of India to reduce the liability of the payment regime and in the alternative to make the Life Insurance Corporation of India available to pay the dues.
GOVERNMENT DECISION Subject to the figures given in the Preamble under this Government Decision, an amount of Rs. 2,28,95, 425/- towards principal and Rs. 64,00,136/- towards interest as on 01.06.2019 and Rs. 2,92,95, 980/- towards principal and Rs. 49,34,593/- towards interest as on 01.12.2019 is required to be made available to the Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran for repayment of loan to Life Insurance Corporation of India during the financial year 2019-20.
2. Out of the above amount available provision of Rs. 2,03,64, 600/- has been released to Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran vide Government Order dated 24.01.2020. However, as per the directions of the Finance Department in the Government Order dated 22nd January, 2020, an amount of Rs. 67,88,200/- (Rupees Sixty Six Lakh Eighty Eight Thousand Two Hundred only) has been made available under Account Head 6215 0094 and the said amount is being disbursed to Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran.

The amount payable by the Municipalities to the Life Insurance Corporation of India has not been made available to the Maharashtra Life Authority for some years. Also, since the repayment of the government loan by the municipalities is not complete and the government is not able to pay the amount due from the Maharashtra Life Authority for the government loan, the amount deposited by the government is negligible, so the said amount cannot be adjusted in the government account. Accordingly, an amount of Rs. 67,88,200/- (Rupees Sixty Six Lakh Eighty Eight Thousand Two Hundred only) to Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran.
The Director (Finance) of Maharashtra Jeevan Adhikaran Shri.
Payments made under the signature of Mr. Yashwant Patil and counter-signed by Mr. M. B.
