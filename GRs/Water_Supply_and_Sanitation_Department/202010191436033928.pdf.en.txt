Instead of the resolution of the Gram Sabha, the necessary consensus should be obtained for the preparation of water scarcity action plans, declaration and related works on the basis of the resolution of the Gram Panchayat.
Declaring scarcity and related matters should be brought to the notice of the citizens in the next gram sabha.
