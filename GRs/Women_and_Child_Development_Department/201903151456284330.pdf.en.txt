Read:- V. Government Resolution No. 2018/ P. No.252/ KA- 06.E dated: 07/01/2019.
At present, 5 Middle Level Training Centres and 30 Anganwadi Training Centres are functioning to impart training to Anganwadi workers, helpers and headmistress/ supervisors under the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS). The training program for all these training centers is prepared by the Commissioner, ABV Seva Yojana, Navi Mumbai. These training institutes are given grants as per the criteria set by the central government. The ratio of central and state funds is 60: 40.
Earlier, the funds of the training institute were shared between the funds sanctioned from the Central Account Head 22361972 (31 Subsidiary Grants) and State Account Head (22361981) (31 Subsidiary Grants). Since the funds sanctioned to the training institutions are separately shown in the APIP, the Finance Department was requested by the Planning Department to approve the opening of a bank account for the purpose of budgeting the funds with Central share of 60% and State share of 40% as separate new head of accounts and to pay the funds of the Central share through PFMS system.
New accounting head of 60% (2001) for Central share and 40% (2012) for State share has been approved. A symbolic supplementary demand proposal was presented in the winter session to implement this article. The Government is permitting the Commissioner, A.B.V. Service Scheme, Navi Mumbai to make available the following provisions under the new head of accounts by way of re-appropriation from the provisions distributed under the earlier head of accounts.
