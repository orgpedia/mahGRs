3. The opinion of the Central Government has been taken in the present case and the Central Government has referred the matter to No. Here's 3
The following comments were made in the letter: : -
1) The Guidelines for "Mission Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0" envisage that
the Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) and Anganwadi Helpers (AWHs) are "honorary
workers" from the local community who come forward to render their services on
part-time basis in the area of child care and development. AWWs and AWHs are
the grass root functionaries who implement the Scheme. The specific instructions
have been issued to all States / UTs that AWWs / AWHs should be from local
village and acceptable in local community.
2) Since the implementation of the Scheme is the undiluted responsibility of the State
Government /UT Administration, no specific guidelines have been laid out by the
Government of India with respect to the recruitment, transfer, posting as well as
retirement of Anganwadi Workers and Anganwadi Helpers. Only a _ broad
framework has been designed to allow the States/UTs to have the required
flexibility to implement the Scheme to achieve maximum efficacy as per their
local requirements. The States have been designated as the primary authorities to
decide the service conditions of Anganwadi Workers and Helpers. But it may be
ensured that being honorary workers from neighbourhood areas, the AWWs and
AWHs must be posted only within their local / nearby areas. They are neither
state government employees nor they constitute any state level or district level
cadre to allow any kind of free transferability.
Considering all the above facts, the State under the Integrated Child Development Services Scheme
The issue of issuing a policy regarding the transfer of Anganwadi workers was under the consideration of the government.
The Government's Decisions:
Appointment of Anganwadi Workers and Anganwadi Helpers in Integrated Child Development Services Scheme
This needs to be done from the local community. Anganwadi workers and helpers in the local area
Being residents, they have the acceptance of the community. So they are familiar with the community.
The community responds to the information / guidance they provide about the scheme. So
The plan can be implemented effectively. For example, in the Integrated Child Development Services scheme.
Transfers to Anganwadi workers and Anganwadi helpers in the state will not be permissible.
Commissioner, Integrated Child Development Services Scheme, Navi Mumbai in pursuance of the aforesaid procedure.
Detailed instructions should be issued to the survey field agencies from their level.
