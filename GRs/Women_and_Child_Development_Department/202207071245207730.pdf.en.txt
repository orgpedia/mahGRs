The Proposal:
The Department of Women and Child Development has formulated a revised policy for orphans, reserving 1% of the total posts in education and employment for orphans. The candidates applying for the orphans reservation have to meet the criteria such as age, educational fees, examination fees, minimum qualification, etc.
However, in view of the small proportion of reservation for orphans as well as in view of the maximum job opportunities available to them, it was under the consideration of the Government to give some time and opportunity to the orphans to pass the Marathi/ English typewriting examination on the lines of ex-servicemen and Divyangs.
Government Decision: The Government has decided to give time and opportunity to the orphan candidates, if they are appointed to the posts in the government service whose service entry rules stipulate passing the typewriting examination (English/ Marathi), to pass the typewriting examination (English/ Marathi) within 2 years from the date of appointment.
