GOVERNMENT DECISION NO. BGT-2022/ PR No.62 (Part-I)/ KA-08 dated 19.10.2022
The proposal:
Under the Integrated Child Protection Scheme, the salaries of employees in child care institutions and permanent and contractual employees working in the state machinery for the same are also paid. At present, these employees are providing their services as it is an essential service in the care and protection of children. However, the salaries of these employees should be paid on time. However, no proposal has been received from the Central Government for the year 2022-23. Therefore, since the Central Government has not received funds for the year 2022-23, only the salary of these employees till October has been paid as per the government decision.
At present, funds are sanctioned and disbursed by the Central Government every year to pay the salaries of the employees of Government Children Homes receiving salaries under the Integrated Child Protection Scheme. Similarly, this year also, the Central Government has submitted a proposal to the Central Government through the State Government for the year 2022-23, which was under consideration of the Government to disburse funds to the Commissioner, Women and Child Development for the salaries of the employees of Government and Non-Government Children Homes/ Observation Homes for the month of November and December, assuming that the State would receive the funds after getting the approval from the Centre.
The government's decision:
By this Government decision, the Finance Department has revised the headings/ objectives of the statement under the Integrated Child Protection Scheme (ICPS) as distributed on the Budget Distribution System from Rakaana 2 to Rakaana No. The funds are disbursed to the Commissioner, Women and Child Development, Pune as mentioned in Section 5
