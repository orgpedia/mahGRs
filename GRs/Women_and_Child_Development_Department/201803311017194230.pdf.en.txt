Government Decision: Anganwadis are run by the Women and Child Development Department in the state. As per the Government decision dated 15th January, 2010, a sum of Rs. 6.00 lakh has been sanctioned for construction of one Anganwadi for non-tribal areas and Rs. 6.60 lakh for tribal areas.
2. Funds are available for construction of Anganwadis under various schemes of the Government, mainly under the District Annual Plan, 13th Finance Commission, NABARD, Minority Department, Human Development Mission, Tribal Sub-Plan and MNREGA. The gram panchayat should provide free land for the construction of anganwadi buildings. If there is no space available in the current financial year after the sanction of funds for the construction of anganwadi, and if there is a water shortage, it is not possible for the Zilla Parishad to complete the construction of the building within the prescribed time. As a result, a large amount of money is being wasted.
3. Earlier, there were difficulties in budgeting funds for construction of Anganwadis due to non-availability of head of accounts at the state level. From the year 2017-18, a new accounting head 42360067 has been approved at the state level for the construction of Anganwadis. The funds have been allocated under this head.
A sum of Rs. 10.00 crore has been budgeted under the head 100% (42360067) at the State level for construction of Anganwadis. In the districts where the construction of the buildings of the Anganwadi Center has been completed 100%. The Government is allowing the release of funds to the districts where only the contractors are yet to be funded (those who have not been fully funded as per the financial norms approved for construction).
The Commissioner, Integrated Child Development Services Scheme, Navi Mumbai shall disburse the said funds to the districts where the construction of the buildings of the Anganwadi Centre is 100% complete and only the contractor is yet to be funded.
