Introduction: Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme for payment of Central and State share of 25: 75 for the posts of Child Development Project Officer, District Programme Officer, Statistical Assistant, Headmistress/ Supervisor. The Centre has directed to implement the Single Nodal Account (SNA) system for Centrally Sponsored Schemes. However, since it is not technically possible to pay through the salary (SNA) system, the salary has been paid through the old system. Also, the state government has provided the central share for this salary. Since the expenditure was incurred outside the SNA system, funds have been received through Supplementary Demands under the new target head 31-Subsidised Grants (Non-salaried) to reflect the expenditure in the SNA system and to reimburse the Central share made available by the State. The matter was under consideration of the government.
Government's decision
Under the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) Scheme, Rs. 33235.18 lakhs (Rupees Three Hundred and Thirty Two Crores Thirty Five Lakh Eighteen Thousand only) to be shown in the Single Nodal Account (SNA) system and reimbursement of Central share made available by the State. 33235.18 lakh (Rupees Three Hundred and Thirty Two Crores Thirty Five Lakh Eighteen Thousand only) to the Commissioner Integrated Child Development Services Scheme, Navi Mumbai.
