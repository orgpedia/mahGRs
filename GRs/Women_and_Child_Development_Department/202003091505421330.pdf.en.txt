Proposal- Central Government to reduce the rate of malnutrition in the state. As per the guidelines of 11th July 2018, Poshan Abhiyan is being implemented across the state. Various activities are being organized under the Poshan Abhiyan. Accordingly, the mechanism of Integrated Child Development Scheme is working to take measures through Anganwadi services on a daily basis for the expected weight gain of pregnant women, their intake of iron-containing, folic acid tablets, increase in the hemoglobin level of pregnant women, at least four health check-ups of registered pregnant women. This will help reduce the number of low birth weight babies.
Accordingly, the Nanded district administration has undertaken a special drive in the district in a phased manner, bit-wise/ project-wise, to bring about the desired improvement in the index based on the above mentioned points. In this campaign, the Anganwadi workers/ helpers and the head maids along with the district heads of the Women and Child Development Department, Public Health Department and other departments effectively coordinated and enthusiastically organized the combined Angan-Pangat during the mid-day meal period for the pregnant women in the Anganwadi Center area. The move was seen as a people's movement in the district.
This initiative in Nanded district has led to an expected increase in the weight of pregnant women in the district within a period of six months to one year. Pregnant women who regularly consumed iron-containing tablets after anorexia also showed a desirable increase in their haemoglobin levels. In addition, by keeping in touch with the daily on the occasion of Angat-Pangat, the pregnant women were able to get four health check-ups required during the pregnancy period. Indirectly taking care of all the indicators related to pregnant women, the Angat-Pangat initiative has shown a positive result and a significant reduction in the proportion of low birth weight babies. This initiative in Nanded district has led to positive results in prevention of malnutrition and reduction in Maternal Mortality Rate, Newborn and Infant Mortality Rate.
Considering the innovative initiative Angat-Pangat implemented in Nanded district of the state and its positive results, the proposal to implement this initiative in all the districts of the state was under consideration of the government.

Government Decision: After considering all the aspects of the above proposal in detail, the Government has decided to implement the" Yashoda Mata Angat-Pangat initiative" at the Anganwadi center level in all the districts of the state.
The process of implementation of the Yashoda Mata Angat-Pangat initiative should be as follows.
1) Under this initiative, all registered pregnant women in the Anganwadi area should ensure that the mid-day meal prepared at their own home reaches the Anganwadi centre on time by taking it in the lunch box.
2) All the pregnant women who have reached the Anganwadi centre will enjoy a joint meal in the Angan-Pangat method.
3) After the personal activities, the pregnant women present will freely discuss with each other about the physical changes during pregnancy, weight gain, problems arising and measures to be taken, health check-ups, nutritious food to be taken by the pregnant woman, etc.
4) They will discuss with each other about regular blood transfusion during pregnancy, iron tablets, Vitamin D tablets, disinfectant tablets, daily rest during pregnancy, avoidance of tobacco and alcohol, benefits of maternity in health institutions, various assistance schemes of the Central and State Governments.
5) On the occasion of Angat-Pangat, pregnant women can spend some time focusing on their own pregnancy and chatting with other pregnant sisters, as well as spend some time in a happy and free atmosphere.
6) The Anganwadi worker should ensure that pregnant women come to the Anganwadi with the packets of iron tablets provided to them for Angan-Pangat activities on a daily basis. The anganwadi worker should also make sure that the pregnant woman has consumed iron tablets immediately after the delivery.
7) Anganwadi and ASHA volunteers and health workers will discuss the services and counselling they receive during pregnancy.
Community Health Officers (CHOs), Health Workers (ANMs) and ASHA volunteers should visit Anganwadi centres during the period of their rotation programme and try to interact with pregnant women.

To make this initiative a people's movement, the local women self-help group members, local panchayat raj institution members should visit the Anganwadi centre from time to time during the period of the initiative and take part in the activities along with pregnant women, Anganwadi workers/ helpers.
12) Anganwadi workers/ helpers and main workers who took this initiative to the height of the people's movement should be honored at the gram panchayat level.
13) This initiative should be carried out in coordination with the Department of Health and the Department of Women and Child Development in the district.
Bharat Ratna Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Amrit Aahar Yojana is being implemented in 85 project areas in 16 tribal districts of the state in coordination with the Tribal Development Department to provide square meals at midday to pregnant women and lactating mothers in the scheduled areas. Since the scheme is being implemented to provide square meals to pregnant women at midday through this scheme, it should be noted that pregnant women in the jurisdiction of such anganwadi centers are not expected to bring home-made midday meals in the lunch box. However, voluntarily bringing home cooked food/ food items/ fruits/ vegetables from the lunch box to the Anganwadi by the pregnant women in the tribal area project should be welcomed as the diversity in food intake is increasing.
However, the district administration in the concerned district should take care to implement the activities as per the procedure mentioned in this government decision in the Anganwadi centers in non-tribal areas and urban areas.
As there will be no financial burden for the implementation of the" Yashoda Mata Angat-Pangat Initiative," all district administrations should plan to implement this initiative in all districts bit-wise/ project-wise in a phased manner.
The procedures and guidelines regarding the implementation of the said government decisions will be issued separately.
