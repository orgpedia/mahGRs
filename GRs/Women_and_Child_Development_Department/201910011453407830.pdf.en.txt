Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme of the Ministry of Women and Child Development, Government of India, implemented by the Office of the Commissioner, Integrated Child Development Services, Navi Mumbai. The total expenditure on account of enhanced grant-in-aid to Anganwadi workers will be Rs. 152265.81 lakh per annum with Central/ State and State share. Accordingly, the total expenditure on account of remuneration is expected to be Rs. 126.88 crore per month on Central/ State and State share. The Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme is a centrally sponsored scheme with a funding pattern of 60:40 between the Centre and the States. There are instructions of the Finance Department that the budgeted shadow provision should not be spent without receiving funds from the Central Government. Due to the non-receipt of funds from the central government, it is not possible to pay the honorarium of Anganwadi workers on time. Therefore, the Finance Department was requested to approve the withdrawal of the honorarium amount on the minus authorization letter. A meeting was held by the Finance Department on 2nd June, 2017 under the Chairmanship of Additional Chief Secretary (Finance). In the meeting, it was decided to allow the department to spend the budgeted amount of the salary of the servitors even if it does not receive funds from the central government.
