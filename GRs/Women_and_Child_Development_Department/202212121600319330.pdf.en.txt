A total of 553 projects, including 104 urban projects and 449 rural projects, are being implemented under the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme in the state. The total number of Anganwadi Centres under these 553 projects is 1,10,486 out of which 15,599 Anganwadi Centres are in urban projects. With the increasing urbanization in the state, the scope of urban local bodies is being expanded. However, Anganwadi Centres in such extended areas are operational in rural projects under the Integrated Child Development Services Scheme. As a result, these Anganwadi Centres in the rural project are not able to get the facilities provided to the Anganwadi Centres by the concerned Zilla Parishad as they come under the purview of the Urban Local Bodies. Therefore, such anganwadi centres must be functional in urban projects. Further, as the geographical demarcation of most of the 104 urban projects in the Integrated Child Development Services Scheme is unclear, the Anganwadi centre/ beat in the area of one urban project is found to be functioning within the jurisdiction of another urban project. Therefore, the above Government have decided to adjust the Anganwadi Centres which are presently under the purview of the Urban Local Bodies under the control of the Rural Project of the Integrated Child Development Services Scheme in the State to the adjoining Urban Projects and to carry out the revised demarcation of the Urban Projects of the 104 Integrated Child Development Services Scheme in the State with better coordination. 4.3.2022 has been approved.
Accordingly, the matter of restructuring the urban/ rural/ tribal projects working under the Integrated Child Development Services Scheme in the state is under the consideration of the government.
