Revised Approval/ 2022-23/ Pune/ 1698D. 30/03/2023
Preamble: Under the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Mission Vatsalya, 40 NGOs are functioning in the State under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 and the Maharashtra State Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Rules, 2018. In addition to the maintenance grant of the admissionees in this institute, the central government also receives a grant for the salary of the employees of this institute. However, since all these institutes are only accredited by the Observatory, the number of admissions to the institute is less as compared to the staff in all these institutes. Therefore, in order to accord recognition to all the above institutions as Observation Homes/ Children Homes, the Government was contemplating to revise the intake capacity of these institutions and grant revised recognition as per the available facilities.
Government Decision: Under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 and the Amended Act, 2021 and the Maharashtra State Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Rules, 2018, the State Government is granting recognition/ revised recognition to the NGOs working in Schedule-A as Observation Homes/ Children Homes for children in need of care and protection and for children in conflict with law under the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Mission Vatsalya.
