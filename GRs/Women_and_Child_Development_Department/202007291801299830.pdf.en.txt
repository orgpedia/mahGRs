GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: SAMARKH 2020/ PR No.77/ WORK-2
Ministry of Women and Child Development No. While the procedure for verification of non-creamy layer certificate of women selected from open category has been fixed as per the decision of the Government in 1, 2 and 3, for the same purpose, the Department of Welfare of Other Backward Classes, Socially and Educationally Backward Classes, Vimukta Jati, Nomadic Tribes and Special Backward Classes has decided to implement the scheme. Step 4 is defined. There is confusion regarding verification of non-creamy layer certificates of women selected from the open category as separate procedures are prescribed by two departments for the same purpose.
In order to avoid such duplication, the Commissioner, Women and Child Development, Pune has proposed that the process of verification of non-creamy layer certificate of a woman candidate selected from open category may be carried out as per the above mentioned rule. 4 The matter was under consideration of the Government to be done by a committee constituted under the chairmanship of the Divisional Commissioner (Revenue) as per the provisions of the Government decision here.
Government Decision: Through this Government Decision, the process of verifying the non-creamy layer certificate of the female candidate selected from the open category in government, semi-government and government-funded institutions, etc., will be completed by the Department of Women and Child Development. In lieu of the provisions contained in the Government Decisions 1, 2 and 3, the Government Decisions of the Department of Welfare of Other Backward Classes, Socially and Educationally Backward Classes, Vimukt Jati, Nomadic Tribes and Special Backward Classes shall not apply. The decision is being taken by the committee constituted under 31.1.2020.
Accordingly, the cases pending with the Joint Commissioner, Commissionerate of Women and Child Development, Pune and Divisional Deputy Commissioner, Women and Child Development for non-criminal verification of open category women should be transferred to the concerned Divisional Commissioner (Revenue).
