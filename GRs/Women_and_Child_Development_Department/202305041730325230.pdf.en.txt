The quality of this No. The above candidate has filed an objection with the Maharashtra Public Service Commission as well as the Department of Medical Education and Medicines. Following the allegations, the appointment of the post of professor, social worker medicine was kept pending.
The Department of Medical Education and Medicines is concerned with the following: " Advertisement No. In 83/2021, the qualification for the post of Professor, Social Worker Medicine Medicine was fixed as three years' experience in the post of Associate Professor. Female candidates working in the posts of Assistant Professor and Associate Professor in Government Medical, Dental and Ayurveda Colleges are not able to get Non Creamy Layer Certificate as their total income on salary is more than Rs. 8,00,000/-. Therefore, it would be appropriate to recommend candidates for the posts falling under the women's reservation only on the basis of merit. " Read No. 10 As per the reference herein, the Maharashtra Public Service Commission has also opined that while recommending eligible candidates for the post reserved for non-resident women, the eligible candidates should be recommended on the basis of merit only when the income of the candidates involved in the direct service recruitment process based on specific educational qualification and/ or experience is more than the limit prescribed by the Government for the advanced and advanced group at the time of advertisement. It has also sought the government's opinion on the matter.
In the above case, Quality No. Despite being at the top of the merit list, merit no. 3 and 6 women candidates have the same annual income but the income criteria for non-criminal certificate for availing reservation for women of different categories is different. Three candidates were not selected.
