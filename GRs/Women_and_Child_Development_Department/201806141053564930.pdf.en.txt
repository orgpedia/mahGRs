However, due to some technical difficulties, they have not been able to pay the honorarium in the PFMS system, so the government has approved the payment of the honorarium of the employees for the month of June 2017 to December 2017 from the treasury in the old method.
The sanctioned strength of Anganwadi workers/ Helpers/ Mini Anganwadi workers in the State is 2 lakh 7 thousand and out of 1,97,788 working Anganwadi workers, the honorarium of 1,91,649 Anganwadi workers/ Helpers/ Mini Anganwadi workers has been paid in the PFMS system so far. The Commissioner, Integrated Child Development Services Scheme, Navi Mumbai vide letter dated 12.06.2018 has informed that 6139 servitors have not been paid their monthly honorarium since April-2018 as their bank accounts have not been linked with Aadhaar.
3) Employees must be paid on a monthly basis. Despite repeated instructions, the Commissionerate has not been able to pay the honorarium of six thousand one hundred and forty-nine servitors in the PFMS system. The matter is very serious and as a last chance, the government is approving the payment of honorarium for the month of April 2018 to July 2018 to the Anganwadi workers/ helpers/ mini Anganwadi workers whose bank accounts have not been linked to Aadhaar. During this period, the Commissioner, Integrated Child Development Services Scheme, Navi Mumbai, will run a special campaign at the Zilla Parishad level to link the bank accounts of the servitors with Aadhaar card and pay their honorarium in the PFMS system. However, from August 1, 2018, the honorarium of the employees should be paid in the PFMS system.
