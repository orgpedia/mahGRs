Introduction: Under the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS), anganwadi workers and helpers are employed at anganwadi centres and mini anganwadi workers are employed at mini anganwadi centres. The Anganwadi/ Mini Anganwadi Centre provides daily services like supplementary nutrition, pre-school education to children in the age group of 0-6 years, pregnant and lactating mothers and health services like immunization, health check-up, health referral services and nutrition and health education. In view of the services provided to the beneficiaries of the Anganwadi Center, it is necessary to provide them to the beneficiaries on a regular basis, with a view to ensure that the future generation of the country remains healthy and fit.
Integrated Child Development Services Scheme (ICDS), though centrally funded, is not funded at the centrally sanctioned APIP ratio of 60%. The state has to pay the salaries from its own funds as the funds for the salaries of the employees are not available from the Centre on time. In some states of India, the age of retirement is 60 years.
Under the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme, Anganwadi workers, mini Anganwadi workers and helpers, being honorary employees, are not required to attain the age of superannuation i.e. 58 years as prescribed by the Government. The Government decision dated 13th August, 2014 provided that Anganwadi workers, helpers and mini Anganwadi workers can work on this honorarium service till they complete 65 years of age or till they are physically unable to work, whichever is earlier.
