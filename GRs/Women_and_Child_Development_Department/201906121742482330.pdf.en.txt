Accordingly, the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM), an international organization, provided funds for a period of three years to run women's counseling centers in a total of 10 places including the above 3 counseling centers in the state. As per the MoU signed between the state government, Tata Institute of Social Sciences and Unifem, after the expiry of the contract period, the state government should review the above centres and run them for the next period if it is found useful. Further, it was decided that other centres to be constructed in future should also be approved on the same terms. 1 here. This was decided by the Government Decision dated 16.8.2001.
