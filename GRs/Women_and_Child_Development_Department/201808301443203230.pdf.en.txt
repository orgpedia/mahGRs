Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) is a centrally sponsored scheme of the Ministry of Women and Child Development, Government of India, implemented by the Office of the Commissioner, Integrated Child Development Services, Navi Mumbai. The matter of disbursement of funds budgeted in 2018-19 for payment of honorarium to Anganwadi workers/ helpers/ mini Anganwadi workers was under consideration.
Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme with a funding pattern of 60:40 between the Centre and the States. There are instructions of the Finance Department that the budgeted shadow provision should not be spent without receiving funds from the Central Government. Due to the non-receipt of funds from the central government, it is not possible to pay the honorarium of Anganwadi workers on time. Therefore, the Finance Department was requested to approve the withdrawal of the honorarium amount on the minus authorization letter. A meeting was held by the Finance Department on 2nd June, 2017 under the Chairmanship of Additional Chief Secretary (Finance).
In the meeting, it has been decided to give permission to the department to spend the budgeted amount of the salary of the servitors even if it does not receive funds from the central government.
The Government has issued an order dated 7th April, 2018 to the Commissioner, Integrated Child Development Services Scheme, Navi Mumbai to spend 70% of the funds budgeted in 2018-19 for the honorarium to be paid to Anganwadi workers/ helpers/ mini Anganwadi workers.
Due to the shortage of funds for payment of honorarium, the funds budgeted under the head of State Accounts have been disbursed with the approval of the Finance Department as per the Government Decision dated 6th July 2018. The supplementary demand proposal was presented in the monsoon session of July-2018 due to the shortage of funds for the honorarium. The Finance Department has approved the expenditure of 70% of the sanctioned Supplementary Demand Fund and the balance 30% of the budgeted funds under the head Central and State Accounts to be spent as per the APIP. Accordingly, the Government is approving to spend the balance fund under the following head amounting to Rs. 44324.80 lakh (Rupees Four Hundred and Forty Three Crores Twenty Four Lakh Eighty Thousand only).
