Public Interest Litigation No. 28/2014 Bhartiya Sthree Shakti v. Government of Maharashtra& Ors. As on 02.06.2015, filling up of new posts is prohibited and the subject is very sensitive as it pertains to schemes, social laws and social values being implemented in the Department of Women and Child Development. There are a large number of vacancies of cooks, cleaners, senior caretakers, junior caretakers, watchmen in various cadres in the field level offices as well as in government/ semi-government institutions. Also, if one of the employees was absent, there were major problems at the organizational level. Therefore, if the posts in the essential services of the Women and Child Development Department are filled temporarily through external agencies, the problems created at the institutional level will be removed and it will be easier to implement the schemes and social laws implemented under the department. Considering this, the government was considering to approve the work of senior caregiver, junior caregiver, peon, cook, watchman, porter/ room servant and sweeper etc. in the field level offices under the Women and Child Development Department as well as in the essential services in government/ semi-government women's/ children's institutions.
Government Decision: Subject to the final approval of the revised format, the Finance Department has decided to make available senior care-givers, junior care-givers, peons, cooks, guards, attendants/ room attendants and cleaners in the field level offices under the Department of Women and Child Development and in essential services in Government/ semi-Government women/ children institutions from external agencies within a total limit of 179 manpower. Established on 09.06.2017. Additional Chief Secretary (Services), General Administration Department and Secretary (Expenditure), Finance Department.
