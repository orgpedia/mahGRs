Government Decision: The Commissionerate was instructed to start the process of depositing the honorarium of the servitors directly into their bank accounts through PFMS system on a pilot basis from February 2017. However, due to some technical difficulties, they have not been able to pay the honorarium in the PFMS system, so the government has approved the payment of the honorarium of some servitors from April-2018 to December-2018 in the old method.

Government Resolution No: ABVI-2015/ P.No.279/ K.S.6
The sanctioned strength of Anganwadi workers/ Helpers/ Mini Anganwadi workers in the State is 2 lakh 7 thousand and out of 1,96,616 working workers, so far the honorarium of 1,95,041 Anganwadi workers/ Helpers/ Mini Anganwadi workers has been paid in the PFMS system. The Commissioner, Integrated Child Development Services Scheme, Navi Mumbai vide letter dated 22.02.2019 has informed that 1575 servitors have not been paid their monthly honorarium since January 2019 as their bank accounts have not been linked with Aadhaar card. The workers should be paid monthly wages. Despite repeated instructions, the Commissionerate has not yet been able to pay the honorarium of 1575 servitors in the PFMS system. This is very serious matter. The Women and Child Development Officers (GPs), Child Development Project Officers (Rural/ Tribal) and Child Development Project Officers (Civil) who are found to be negligent or reluctant to complete the work. The Chief Executive Officer (ZP) and Commissioner, Integrated Child Development Services Scheme, Navi Mumbai should take immediate disciplinary action against the Anganwadi workers/ helpers/ mini Anganwadi workers who are not cooperating in linking their accounts with the PFMS system. The letter was dated February 26, 2019. Repeated demand for payment of honorarium offline is not in accordance with the rules and discipline. As a last chance to ensure timely payment of honorarium to Anganwadi workers, the Government is approving the payment of honorarium to 1575 Anganwadi workers/ helpers/ mini Anganwadi workers whose bank accounts have not been linked with Aadhaar card for the period from 1st January 2019 to 31st March 2019.
