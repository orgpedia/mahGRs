Letter No.-Ebaviseo/ Ka-5/ Training/ 5074/2018, dated 29/12/2018 Government Decision Under the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS), 5 Middle Level Training Centres (MTCs) and 30 Anganwadi Training Centres (ATCs) are functioning at present for imparting training to Anganwadi workers, helpers and Headmistress/ Supervisors. The training programme for all these training centres is prepared by the Commissioner, ABV Seva Yojana, Navi Mumbai to achieve the training objectives. These training institutes are given grants as per the criteria set by the central government. The ratio of central and state funds is 60: 40.
Earlier, the funds of the training institute were shared between the funds sanctioned from the Central Account Head 22361972 (31 Subsidiary Grants) and State Account Head (22361981) (31 Subsidiary Grants).
Since the funds sanctioned to the training institutions are separately shown in the APIP, the Finance Department was requested by the Planning Department to approve the opening of a bank account for the purpose of budgeting the funds with Central share of 60% and State share of 40% as separate new head of accounts and to pay the funds of the Central share through PFMS system.
New accounting head of 60% (2001) for Central share and 40% (2012) for State share has been approved. A symbolic supplementary demand proposal was presented in the winter session to implement this article. The Government is permitting the Commissioner, A.B.V. Service Scheme, Navi Mumbai, to make available the provisions under the new head of accounts by way of reallocation from the provisions distributed under the earlier head.
The Finance Department has notified the registration under the Special Product Code of the State Bank of India and the opening of an account in a nationalized bank to disburse the funds of the training institute.
It is also recommended to adopt single account with multiple digital signatures with payment limits in the near future. Government to take action
