Introduction: The outbreak of COVID-19 has been rampant in the state for the last two years. Many people have lost their lives in the first and second wave of Covid-19.
In many places, children between the ages of 0 and 18 have become orphans due to the death of both parents in the same family. Many women have become single after the death of their husbands. It is the moral duty of the government to ensure that the children who have lost both parents due to Covid-19 are given their rightful rights and given proper care and rehabilitation of single/ widowed women after the death of the head of the household, their economic and social development and reassure them about their future and give them a respectable position in the society.
2. Under the above Reference No. 3 Government Decision, children who have lost both parents due to COVID-19 will be given a lump sum amount of Rs. 5.00 lakh per month as child support. The government has waived off the fees of the orphaned children if their education is done in government institutions and the facility of paying their education fees in private schools has been made available through NGOs. Apart from this, various schemes have been announced by the government for orphan children. Similarly, women who have become single/ widowed after the death of the male member of the household due to Covid-19 need to be rehabilitated by taking advantage of the schemes implemented by various government departments.
Under the Government decision of Reference No. 5, in order to ensure proper rehabilitation of single/ widowed women due to the outbreak of COVID-19 and to uphold their rightful rights, the Task Force has been entrusted with the responsibility of extending the scope of the Task Force at the district level and ensuring that these women get the benefits of the schemes of various departments of the Government.
Many single/ widowed women do not have access to government offices and are unaware of government schemes and procedures. Therefore, the possibility of such women and orphan children being deprived of government schemes cannot be ruled out. Single women and orphans
