The Proposal:
Section 41 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 makes it mandatory for residential institutions taking care of children to have a registration certificate from the state government. The validity period of this certificate has been extended to 5 years. Also, the certificate of registration issued under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000 and the Amended Act, 2006 are deemed to be valid under the Act, 2015.
As per the provisions of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000 and the Amended Act, 2006, residential institutions for children in the state were issued registration certificates by the Commissioner, Women and Child Development Commissionerate, Pune under Section 34 (3) of the Act. However, since the validity period is not mentioned in most of the registration certificates issued under the Act, 2006, the Act has been amended as per Rule 22 (b) of the Maharashtra State Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Rules, 2018.
