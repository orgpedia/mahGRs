Preamble: Gram Panchayat, Herwad. Kolhapur's Sh. On 05.05.2022, a resolution regarding the abolition of the undesirable widow system prevalent in the society has been unanimously passed in the Gram Sabha. In the centenary year of the memory of Rajarshi Shahu Maharaj, the work done by this Gram Sabha, while preserving the legacy of his progressive thoughts, is commendable. In the society, even today, the custom of wiping the wrists of the wife on the death of the husband, breaking the mangalsutra around the neck, breaking the bangles in the hands, removing the shackles from the feet is being followed. After the death of the husband, these women have a certain religious and social status in society
are not allowed to participate in the program. These practices violate the human rights of women. Therefore, the officers and employees of the Rural Development Department as well as the locals should take appropriate action to create widespread awareness in the society regarding the abolition of the widow system.
The Rural Development Department has issued a circular to the officials of the self-government institutions to make efforts.
Under the government decision here, Mission Vatsalya scheme is being implemented in the state to provide benefits of various government schemes to women who have become single/ widowed after the death of the male member of the household due to Covid-19. Implementation of the scheme in rural areas

GOVERNMENT DECISION NO. 2022/ PR No.49/ K-03 Teams have been formed at village level and ward level in urban areas. These teams include Grama Sevaks/ Ward Officers, Talathis, Primary Teachers, Anganwadi workers. The matter of issuing instructions for efforts to eradicate the widow system through these village-level and ward-level teams was under the consideration of the government.
Government's decision:
Wiping off the wrists of the wife at the time of her husband's death, breaking the mangalsutra around the neck, breaking the bangles in the hands, removing the shackles from the feet are common in the society. After the death of the husband, his wife has to face neglect while living in society as a widow.
These women are then not allowed to participate in certain religious and social events in society. These practices violate the dignity of such women, their human rights to life and their constitutional rights. Women have the right to live with dignity like other women. This practice needs to be stopped. There is also a need to create awareness in the community.
With a view to honouring these women and protecting their rights after the death of their husbands, the ward-level and village-level teams formed under Mission Vatsalya should create awareness and take proactive efforts to eradicate the widowhood practice prevalent in the society.
→ The team members should visit the family of a married man in the ward/ village after the incident of his death and console the family. And then educate the family about the ill-effects of this practice.
Families should be made aware that the actions involved in widowhood practice have a greater negative impact on a woman who is already grieving the death of her husband.
This practice causes injustice to a member of one's own family, lowers her dignity, makes her position in society secondary, prohibits her from participating in certain social/ religious activities despite her fault.
Try to convince the family not to adopt this practice.
→ Contact the people's representatives and other eminent persons of your village/ ward and seek their cooperation in spreading awareness about the abolition of widowhood.
The office bearers of the local self-government institutions concerned as well as the trustees of various communities should be encouraged to pass such resolutions in their respective areas as per the resolution made by the Gram Panchayat Herwad, District Kolhapur regarding the abolition of the widow system.
