Preamble: The Government of Uttar Pradesh has taken the lead in making eco-friendly products like perfumes/ scented water, gulal, incense sticks, incense sticks etc. from the extracts of flowers obtained from the Vrindavan temple. The Supreme Court has also ordered in this regard that temples like Jagannath Temple, Puri and Varanasi can take such initiatives. In view of the Supreme Court's order, all the State/ UT Governments are required to verify whether it is possible to experiment with the Vrindavan Temple by considering the quantity of flowers available in the temples in their State. The above experiment is expected to be carried out in the temples where flowers are offered in large quantities as well as in the temples where there is a widow ashram nearby or the women of the surrounding area can get employment and where technical information can be easily provided.
Therefore, it was under the consideration of the government to appoint a nodal officer at the state level so that the National Commission for Women could quickly get information regarding the making of eco-friendly products like perfumes/ scented water, gulal, incense sticks, incense sticks etc. from the nectar obtained in the temples of the state.
Government Decision: Since the above experiment is expected to be carried out in the temples where flowers are offered on a large scale and where there is a widow ashram near the temple or the women of the surrounding area can get business by training, the Managing Director, Women's Economic Development Corporation (Mavim), Bandra (East), Mumbai is being appointed as the coordinating officer for this purpose.
