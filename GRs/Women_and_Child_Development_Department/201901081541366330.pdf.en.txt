INTRODUCTION: The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) assisted Tejaswini Maharashtra Rural Women Empowerment Programme was implemented by MAVIM from 2007 to 2018 to transfer ownership of Self Help Groups in Maharashtra to the people, build and strengthen people's institutions for sustainable development, develop and empower women's capabilities, skills, establish their ownership of livelihood resources, increase women's active participation in government, decision-making, develop management information systems, link groups with banks, etc. As on March 2018, MAVIM has established 1.08 lakh women SHGs under various developmental programmes, involving 13.05 lakh women. The total savings of these SHGs has been Rs. 489.61 crore and loans to the tune of Rs. 2031.75 crore have been sanctioned to these SHGs through various banks. The bank has an outstanding loan of Rs. 351.00 crore to SHGs with a repayment rate of 99%.
2. Based on the success of Tejaswini programme, there is a need to take the agenda of women empowerment to the next level. It is essential to support the CMRC from the point of view of providing livelihood opportunities to SHG members, value addition to their ongoing businesses and thereby benefitting them in increasing their income, besides local market, and to engage women in the extension of the marketing network by providing them access to support systems like warehousing. In a nutshell, the Government was contemplating to implement the" Nava Tejaswini- Maharashtra Rural Women Entrepreneurship Development Project" to further enhance the various achievements mentioned above and to implement the initiatives related to poverty alleviation and women empowerment in a more comprehensive manner.
