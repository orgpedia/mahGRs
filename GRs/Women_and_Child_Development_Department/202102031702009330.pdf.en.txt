Introduction: Under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, orphaned, destitute children in need of care and protection are deprived of various government benefits due to lack of caste certificate after leaving the institution. According to the provisions of section 1 and 2, 1% parallel reservation has been provided in the open category in education and jobs. However, there is no separate committee/ mechanism to discuss and decide on various educational, social, economic problems of orphan children. Therefore, a state-level advisory committee for orphans should be formed to discuss the various problems of orphan children and take measures accordingly. This was stated by the Minister of State (WCD) in the review meeting of the Department held on 11.2.2020. Accordingly, the government was considering the formation of a state-level committee involving orphan children to discuss and take measures on various problems of orphan children.
Government Decision: In line with the above background, this Government decision approves the constitution of a State Level Orphan Advisory Committee to discuss and decide on various educational, social, economic problems of orphan children. The composition and functions of the Committee shall be as follows:
