Union of India& Ors. (Petition regarding gross violation of the fundamental rights of persons affected by Leprosy). Supreme Court, New Delhi. In the order dated 10.09.2018, it was directed that necessary action should be taken so that there is no discrimination against leprosy patients.
(1) The Government Leprosy Home, Kedgaon, Ta., functioning for beggars in the State under the Women and Child Development Department. Karmala, Solapur district. (2) The Government Leprosy Home, Puikolad, Ta. The names in the government documents of Roha and Raigad districts showed discrimination against leprosy patients.
3. However, though the name of the institutions includes the word Leprosy Home/ Leprosy Bhikshakari Grih, the entry of leprosy-affected monks as well as other monks into the Bhikshakari Grih is being allowed and at present, both the institutions are meant only for the monks and there is no discrimination against the monks admitted therein, whether as lepers or otherwise. Therefore, the matter of changing the names in the government documents of the two institutions was under the consideration of the government.
