Government's decision:

The total expenditure on account of enhanced grant-in-aid to Anganwadi workers will be Rs. 152265.81 lakh per annum with Central/ State and State share. Accordingly, the total expenditure on account of remuneration is expected to be Rs. 126.88 crore per month, on Central/ State and State share. It is under consideration to disburse the funds budgeted in 2019-20 for payment of honorarium to Anganwadi workers, helpers and mini Anganwadi workers.
Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme with a funding pattern of 60:40 between the Centre and the States. There are instructions of the Finance Department that the budgeted shadow provision should not be spent without receiving funds from the Central Government. Due to the non-receipt of funds from the central government, it is not possible to pay the honorarium of Anganwadi workers on time. Therefore, the Finance Department was requested to approve the withdrawal of the honorarium amount on the minus authorization letter. A meeting was held by the Finance Department on 2nd June, 2017 under the Chairmanship of Additional Chief Secretary (Finance). In the meeting, it was decided to allow the department to spend the budgeted amount of the salary of the servitors even if it does not receive funds from the central government.
4. The Finance Department, vide Government Circular dated 8/7/2019, has approved the release of funds within the limit of 60% of the budgetary provision for the financial year 2019-20 as per the Maharashtra Appropriation Act, 2019. Accordingly, there should be no objection to the approval of expenditure of Rs. 10736.60 lakh (Rupees One Hundred and Seven Crores Thirty Six Lakhs Sixty Thousand only) under the following head of accounts out of the funds budgeted in the year 2019-20 for the honorarium to be paid to Anganwadi workers, helpers and mini Anganwadi workers.
