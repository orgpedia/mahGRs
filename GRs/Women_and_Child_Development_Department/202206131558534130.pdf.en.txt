The Proposal:
Under the Integrated Child Protection Scheme (ICPS), the salaries of staff in child care institutions and permanent and contractual employees working in the state machinery for the same are also paid. At present, these employees are providing their services as it is an essential service in the care and protection of children. However, the salaries of these employees should be paid on time. However, from 2022 to 2022
The salaries of these employees have not been paid due to non-receipt of funds from the Central Government for the year 2022-23.
2. As at present, the Central Government has been sanctioning and disbursing this fund every year to pay the salaries of the employees receiving salaries under the Integrated Child Protection Scheme, in the same way, this year also the Central Government will submit a proposal to the Central Government through the State Government for the year 2022-23 and the Government is considering to disburse the amount of salary of these employees to the Commissioner, Women and Child Development, Pune in the amount approved by the Finance Department, assuming that the State will receive the fund after the approval of the Center.
