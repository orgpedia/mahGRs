The Government has decided to earmark at least 3% of the total budget of the Planning Department to the District Planning Committee for the scheme of Women and Child Empowerment implemented by the Women and Child Development Department. 1 here. The approval has been accorded vide Government Resolution dated 31.1.2022. Sub-Plan No.B) Economic Empowerment of Women in the said Government Decision includes the following provisions at Nos. 4, 5 and 6:
In order to accelerate the enterprise development of women in Maharashtra, Entrepreneurship Development Programmes are being implemented through Mavim/ CMRC to increase the participation of women in agriculture and agro-based projects, especially in value-added chain, post-harvest projects and to benefit women at large scale in non-agriculture and service sector activities. Priority should be given to environmental protection and conservation. This will help start a women-led initiative in Maharashtra. These projects are expected to be commercially viable enterprises across a broad value chain. Similar sub-project projects are being developed through Mavim in the IFAD assisted Nava Tejaswini Yojana. For such commercial and comprehensive projects, financial assistance is available in the ratio of 25% from IFAD and at least 10% from public participation. Therefore, considering the need to mobilize the remaining funds for such projects, financial assistance should be made available from 3% DPDC as per requirement. This type of financial support should be used to ensure that the construction/ machinery, etc. of the common assets involved in the value chain initiative and similar fixed components are carried out in accordance with the procedures laid down. This action should be taken according to the guidelines regarding the new Tejaswini scheme.
(5) Since this provision has been included in the Nava Tejaswini Scheme, the said provision shall be applicable only for the period of Nava Tejaswini Scheme.
Individual benefit schemes cannot be funded from the 3% DPDC funds earmarked for the Department of Women and Child Development.
