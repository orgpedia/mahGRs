Preamble: Under the Integrated Child Protection Scheme, the Central share for payment of salary to the staff of Government Children Homes/ Observation Homes is Rs. 1357.55 lakhs and State share of Rs. 905.03 lakh. 2262.58 lakh has been provided in the Budget out of which Rs. 1021.60 lakhs and Rs. 683.32 lakh. 1704.92 lakh has been disbursed to the Commissioner Women and Child Development as per the Government decisions.
2. The Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Integrated Child Protection Scheme was launched in the State from the year 2012-13. Earlier, the employees of 37 Government Children Homes/ Observation Homes and 40 Non-Government Children Homes/ Observation Homes run by District Inspection and Maintenance Organizations were working on the pay scale of the State Government and 100% funds for their salaries were being provided by the State Government.
Since the implementation of the Integrated Child Protection Scheme in the state, these institutions have been included in the Integrated Child Protection Scheme, so the funds for the salaries of these employees are received in the form of honorarium as determined in the scheme and the necessary additional provision is made by the state government to pay salaries according to the salary range.
In view of the above, the Government is considering to release additional funds required for payment of salaries to the staff of 37 Government Children Homes/ Observation Homes under the Integrated Child Protection Scheme.
