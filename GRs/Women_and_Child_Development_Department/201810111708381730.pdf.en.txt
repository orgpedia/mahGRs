Preamble: Anganwadis are run by the Department of Women and Child Development in the state.
As per the Government decision dated 15th January, 2010, the plan for construction of buildings for Anganwadis has been finalised and a sum of Rs. 6.00 lakh has been sanctioned for construction of one Anganwadi for non-tribal areas and Rs. 6.60 lakh for tribal areas.
Funds are available for the construction of Anganwadis under various schemes of the government, mainly under the District Annual Plan, 13th Finance Commission, NABARD, Minority Department, Human Development Mission and MANREGA. The land for the construction of anganwadi building should be provided free of cost by the Gram Panchayat. After the sanction of funds for the construction of anganwadi, if the place is not available in the current financial year, and if there is a water shortage, the district council is not able to complete the construction of the building within the prescribed period. As a result, a large amount of money is wasted. Also, the tenderer contractors delay the completion of the incomplete construction due to the increase in the price of materials next year. Due to the recent increase in the amount of construction materials, there is a demand from the district level to increase the building construction amount per Anganwadi center.
The matter of increasing the existing amount for the construction of Anganwadi Center building was under the consideration of the government.
Government Decision: As per the Government Decision dated 15th January, 2010, the plan for construction of Anganwadi Centre buildings has been finalised. As per the scheme, an amount of Rs. 8.50 lakh (including GST) for construction of one Anganwadi Centre building for non-tribal areas and one Anganwadi for tribal areas from the financial year 2018-19.
