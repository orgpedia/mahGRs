At present, these employees are providing their services as it is an essential service in the care and protection of children. However, the salaries of these employees should be paid on time. However, since no proposal has been received from the Central Government for the year 2022-23, the salaries of these employees have not been paid.
At present, the Central Government has approved and disbursed this fund every year to pay the salaries of the employees of the Government Children's Home who are receiving salaries under the Integrated Child Protection Scheme, similarly, this year also the Central Government will submit a proposal to the Central Government through the State Government for the year 2022-23 and the Government is considering to disburse the fund for the salaries of the employees of the Government Children's Home to the Member Secretary, Maharashtra State Child Protection Society, Pune and the Commissioner, Women and Child Development.
