Reference:
1. m. The Deputy Chief Minister (Finance), in his budget speech for 2020-21, announced the setting up of offices of the Maharashtra State Women's Commission at the divisional level.
The state of Maharashtra is geographically large, comprising rural, urban, semi-urban and tribal areas. There are small villages, hamlets and villages in this area. Any woman can be a victim of rape in any field. Such women need immediate medical attention. Mumbai is not the centre of Maharashtra. Therefore, it is difficult for such women to reach the commission. Also, in view of the increasing number of atrocities against women, there is a need to have an office at the divisional level to provide immediate assistance to them.
Since the Commission does not have the power to enforce, it takes the help of district authorities, police, health department to solve the problems of the victims at the local level. If there is an office at the divisional level, it will be easy to take help from the government enforcement agencies at the local level and the victim will get justice as soon as possible.
Due to the awareness campaign of the Commission, the number of complaints coming to the Commission has increased. For early redressal of this grievance, if there is a sub-divisional office of the Commission at the divisional level also, it will be possible to resolve the increasing number of complaints as soon as possible.
The awareness campaign is always carried out by the Commission's office. However, the problems of each department are different. Therefore, it will be possible to conduct workshops, trainings, conduct awareness campaigns, etc. activities according to the needs of the area, considering the local problems there.
If all the women have to work in a comprehensive manner to solve the problems and reach out to the last woman and make her life happy and satisfied, then it is necessary to get immediate/ speedy justice and therefore the Commission should have a sub-divisional office at the level of every Divisional Commissioner. According to As per the announcement made by the Deputy Chief Minister (Finance) in the budget speech of 2020-21 regarding the establishment of offices of the Maharashtra State Women's Commission at the divisional level
