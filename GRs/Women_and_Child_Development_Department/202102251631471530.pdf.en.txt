Under the chairmanship of Additional Chief Secretary (Finance), it should be possible to pay the honorarium of Anganwadi workers as they do not receive funds from the Central Government within the stipulated time.
In the meeting held on 2nd June, 2017, it has been decided to allow the Department to spend the budgeted amount of honorarium of Anganwadi workers even if the expected Central assistance is not available.
As per the decision of the Government, for the payment of honorarium to Anganwadi workers, helpers and mini Anganwadi workers for the month of January and February, 2021, the main head/ sub-head/ target in Rakana No. 2 is being reduced as shown in Rakana No. 4 and is being increased by reallocation as in Rakana No. 5. Accordingly, the total amount of Rs. 19793.58 lakh is being approved to be disbursed as shown in Rakana No.7 from the existing provision after reallocation in the Principal Account Head/ Sub Head/ Target in Rakana No.2. The budgetary allocation and proposed disbursement for this purpose is as follows (Rs. in lakhs)
