As per the provisions of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000 and the Amended Act, 2006, residential institutions for children in the state were issued registration certificates by the Commissioner, Women and Child Development Commissionerate, Pune under Section 34 (3) of the Act. However, since the validity period is not mentioned in most of the registration certificates issued under the Act, 2006, as per Rule 22 (b) of the Maharashtra State Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Rules, 2018, the validity period of registration certificates obtained under the Act, 2006 shall be extended.

Necessary opportunity and sufficient time was provided to all concerned to rectify the defects in the applications received. The proposals received at the level of Commissioner, Women and Child Development Commissionerate, Pune were scrutinized and the children's homes of the NGOs fulfilling the qualifying documents in Sample-27 were physically inspected by the field officers.
