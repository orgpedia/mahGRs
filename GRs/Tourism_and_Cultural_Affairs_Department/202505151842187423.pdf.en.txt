Introduction:-
With a vision to develop Maharashtra as popular and sustainable tourist destination
wherein state will offer vast experiences on global, regional and local best practices and
standards, Maharashtra Tourism Policy, 2024 was issued. The objective of the Maharashtra
Tourism Policy 2024 is to bring in investments in to the tourism sector to the tune of approx.
INR.1,00,000 Crore over the period of 10 years and also to create around 18 Lakhs jobs both
directly and indirectly. The policy also focuses on setting up MICE (Meetings, Incentives,
Conferences & Exhibitions) Bureau, thus the issue of formation of MICE Bureau was under
consideration of the government.
1. Background
According to the national strategy of India, MICE-an acronym for Meetings, Incentives,
Conferences, and Exhibitions-is an essential component of the business travel sector, aimed at
promoting networking and encouraging meaningful interactions across different sectors,
including business, industry, government, and academia. However, the global perspective on
MICE Industry includes economic, social, and cultural benefits too.
2. Economic and Social Significance of MICE
The MICE industry is a significant contributor to the global economy, generating
substantial income and employment opportunities. In 2018, the global exhibition industry

Government Resolution No. TDS-2024/10/CR. NO. 185/Tourism-4
alone contributed USD 325 billion to the economy, with nearly 32,000 exhibitions held
worldwide.
MICE events, by their nature, attract high-spending delegates who often stay in premium
accommodations and engage in additional leisure activities, thus driving substantial revenue
for local economies.
Established MICE markets like the USA, Germany, and France continue to lead in terms
of the number of international meetings. However, emerging destinations, especially in the
Asia-Pacific region, are demonstrating remarkable growth potential.
Countries like Ireland, Norway, and Greece have improved their global rankings by
focusing on strategic positioning and increasing their international event hosting capabilities.
MICE events foster international relations and cultural exchange, providing opportunities
for networking and knowledge sharing across different sectors.
Hosting large-scale events can enhance a city s global image and attractiveness, contributing
to long-term tourism and business opportunities.
3. MICE in India (National Perspective):
India holds a modest share in the global MICE market, ranked 37th in the ICCA 2022
rankings, a decline from the 28th position in 2019. This decline highlights the need for more
strategic efforts to enhance India's MICE capabilities. Major Indian cities such as New Delhi,
Mumbai, and Bengaluru have experienced fluctuating rankings in hosting international
meetings, indicating potential for growth and improvement.
The Indian MICE sector, valued at Rs. 37,576 crore, significantly contributes to the economy
through direct and indirect spending. The trade fair sector alone has a substantial economic
impact, with an estimated value of 23,800 crore INR. During India's G20 Presidency, over
200 meetings were organized across 56 cities in India. This sparked unprecedented interest
both nationally and internationally, showcasing India's robust MICE infrastructure and its rich
cultural and natural heritage to the world. The Ministry of Tourism is committed to building
on this momentum to firmly position India as a global leader in the MICE industry.
Developing the MICE sector in India can drive business growth, create jobs in hospitality,
transportation, and other service sectors, and enhance overall economic development. MICE
events provide a platform for knowledge dissemination, professional development, and
cultural exchange, helping to position India as a competitive global business events

investment, positively impacting local communities and enhancing cultural understanding.
4. Roles of MICE in Maharashtra
a. MICE tourism differs from traditional tourism as it specifically focuses on attracting and
