Gochin 2016/ p. No.189/ S. Q. 1, d. 21.11.2019
Introduction: The department. As per the Government decision dated 22.05.2018, it was decided to introduce a single window scheme at the level of Maharashtra Film, Theatre and Cultural Development Corporation.
In this government decision, the basic form and functioning of the scheme was explained. In the first phase, the scheme covered only shooting locations in Mumbai city and suburbs under government/ semi-government agencies. Keeping in view the experience gained in the implementation of the initial phase, it was under the consideration of the government to extend the scope of the scheme to the entire state of Maharashtra with necessary changes.
Government Decisions: Coordination with the concerned Government/ Paramilitary Departments within the prescribed time frame for shooting at Government/ Paramilitary shooting locations covered under the One Window Scheme.
The government is taking the following decisions to issue the necessary permissions.
Maharashtra Film, Theatre and Cultural Development Corporation, Dadasaheb Phalke Chitranagari, Goregaon (East), Mumbai will act as the" Controlling Agency" for the implementation of the scheme.
Necessary no-objection/ permissions of State Government/ Paramilitary Departments will be granted for shooting at Government/ Paramilitary shooting locations under the Central/ State Government through the Single Window Scheme.
The concerned producers are required to apply through online system on the web portal www.filmcell.maharashtra.gov.in for obtaining necessary permissions for shooting.

4. No-objection certificate from the authorized department of the concerned filming location is mandatory to be submitted along with the application for filming at the filming location under the Central Government.
No-objection permissions will be given by the government/ semi-government departments, such as police administration, local self-government institutions or similar departments, which are required for shooting at private filming locations through the single window scheme.
For shooting at a private shooting location, it is mandatory to submit a no-objection certificate and identity card of the owner/ authorized person of the filming location along with the application.
For indoor shooting at private shooting locations, no temporary structures or sets are required to be erected, for such shooting also it will be mandatory for the concerned producer to apply on the web portal of the Single Window Scheme and pay the required fee.
All the necessary information about the film will be provided by the concerned department officials and locals.
The portal will be available on the dashboards of police stations and traffic branches.
The permission granted under the Single Window Scheme is limited to filming at the said location on the specified date and within the prescribed time and this permission shall in no way be treated as an official proof regarding the said location.
After the producer checks through the online system whether the shooting location is available for the period for which they want to shoot, accepts the terms and conditions of the shooting at the relevant location, and pays the required fee through e-payment [the fee fixed by the concerned government/ semi-government agencies for their shooting location and the reserve amount fixed at the required location], the producers will receive the Order ID and Order Date and then the process of permission for filming will start.
10.Now that the producer has paid the required fee and received the Order ID and Order Date, their application for permission will be received on the dashboard of the web portal by the Government/ Semi-Governmental Organizations (Stakeholders) associated with the filming location as well as the Chitra Nagar Nigam, which acts as the controlling body.
11.N. It shall be binding on the Stakeholder to approve or deny permission for shooting within 7 working days from the date of receipt of the application of the producer by the concerned agency at the place of shooting (i.e. from the date of receipt of Order ID and Order Date by the producer).

GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: GOACHIN 2016/ P.No. 189/ S.K.-1
If the concerned agency does not take the necessary action regarding the shooting permission, after following up with the government/ semi-government agencies associated with the filming location within 7 working days from the date of receipt of the application of the producer, the shooting will be allowed by the Chitranagar Corporation (Controlling Agency) on the assumption that there is no objection to the shooting of the said agency.
After the permission of the producer for the shooting, the amount of his fee will be paid by the controlling agency to the stakeholders related to the shooting locations through e-payment on the last day of the shooting and in exceptional cases within 2 days from the end of the shooting.
14.Just in case of denial of permission by the concerned Government/ Stakeholders, the reason for the same shall be communicated to the producer through the Chitranagar Nigam (Controlling Agency) through the portal dashboard immediately. The amount deposited by the manufacturer through e-payment will be paid through e-payment within the next 2 days on the date of disallowance and in exceptional cases, excluding the processing fee.
15. In case of Parliament, no permission/ objection is given by some government/ quasi-government machinery unless it is given by other stakeholders. However, for grant of permission/ no-objection in a single window scheme, one of the systems involved in the scheme need not depend on another system. Because the final permission for the shooting will be taken by the controlling agency after considering the permission/ no-objection of all government/ semi-government agencies. Therefore, the government/ semi-government agencies will be required to convey their permission/ objection to the regulatory body immediately without depending on the permission/ objection of other government agencies.
When no-objection certificate is required from various agencies involved in the project for a single shooting location, permission will be granted by the controlling agency within the stipulated time only if all the concerned agencies issue such a certificate. However, if one of the systems refuses a no-objection certificate, the producer will be informed within the stipulated time that permission has been denied for shooting at the concerned location.
17.On every application received on the web portal of the Single Window Scheme for a No-Objection Certificate for filming, the Maharashtra Film, Theatre and Cultural Development Corporation will charge a processing fee of Rs. A fee of Rs 2,000 will be charged.
Once the permission for shooting is granted, the producer cannot cancel the booking of the film and the shooting fee will not be refunded.

21.N. If the shooting could not take place due to some natural calamity after the permission of the producer for shooting, the amount of shooting fee shall not be refunded to the producer.
22.When the amount reserved for the shooting location is paid by the producer through e-payment, the amount is required to be returned to the concerned producer after the shooting.
The painting will remain with the city corporation. If no compensation claim is received from the concerned agency regarding the reserve amount after the completion of the shooting, the reserve amount will be refunded to the producers by the Chitranagar Corporation within 2 working days from the date of completion of the shooting.
23. The responsibility of successful implementation of the said scheme shall be of the Chitranagar Municipal Corporation as the controlling body. However, the Goregaon Chitranagari Nigam, the regulatory body, will only work to coordinate between the producers and the government/ semi-government agencies. The producer
The entire responsibility of granting permission for filming will be of the concerned government/ semi-government organization. For this, the government agencies shot at the filming location under their jurisdiction.
The terms and conditions for grant of permission should be carefully determined so that, in accordance with those terms and conditions, the permission for filming is granted to the producer.
