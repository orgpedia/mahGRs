The Proposal:
A new Directorate of Tourism has been set up under the administrative control of the Department of Tourism for the growth of tourism in the State and for effective formulation and implementation of tourism policy. The Directorate of Tourism has six Regional Offices at Nagpur, Aurangabad, Amravati, Sindhudurg, Nashik and Pune with the Deputy Director (Tourism) as its Head. The Regional Offices under the Directorate of Tourism have been set up on the lines of the office of the Divisional Commissioner (Revenue). The Konkan Divisional Commissioner (Revenue) office is located at Belapur, Navi Mumbai and covers Mumbai city, Mumbai suburbs, Thane, Raigad, Palghar, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg districts. Similarly, most of the government departments have their divisional offices in Konkan, including the Konkan Bhavan, CBD Belapur and surrounding areas.
Therefore, the presence of the Divisional Office of the Department of Tourism at Konkan Bhawan will be relevant for the contact at the divisional level and it will be possible to carry out tourism related works effectively and efficiently.
The state government is planning to shift the zonal office of the Directorate of Tourism from Sindhudurg to Belapur and Navi Mumbai.
The Cabinet also approved the shifting of the Sindhudurg Divisional Office of the Directorate of Tourism to Belapur, Navi Mumbai. Accordingly, the employees who have been temporarily transferred to the Directorate of Tourism in the Project Office of Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation in Sindhudurg should be sent back to the Project Office, Sindhudurg.
The tourism activities will be handled by the Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation through the Corporation's Project Office at Sindhudurg. This will enable effective and efficient implementation of tourism activities in North and South Konkan.
