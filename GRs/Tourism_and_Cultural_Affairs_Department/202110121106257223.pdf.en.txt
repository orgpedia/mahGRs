Preamble: The Government is considering to relax the restrictions imposed on various activities/ activities under the Government Orders issued from time to time to contain the spread of COVID-19 virus. The Government has received requests from various organizations/ institutions in the sector to allow the opening of closed auditoriums/ other open spaces in the wake of COVID-19. There has been a persistent demand from various quarters to allow resumption of cultural events, except films and plays, in closed halls/ open spaces. These units are unorganized and economically at the lowest level. The unit is facing huge financial difficulties due to the restrictions imposed by the government from time to time to prevent the spread of Covid-19 virus. Therefore, it was under the consideration of the government to relax the restrictions on cultural events in closed halls/ open spaces, except films and dramas, like theatres and drama theatres in the state. The government has taken the following decisions:
