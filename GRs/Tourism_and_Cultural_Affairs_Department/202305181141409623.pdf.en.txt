Introduction: The formation of the Barawas in the state of Maharashtra began from the Satavahana period. At present, there are about 20000 historical Baravas. It has been observed that these barrows are presently in a dilapidated, submerged state and are not being used as a source of water. Considering the historical and social significance of these ancient Barawas, the government was considering the formation of a Baraw Conservation Committee consisting of experts for the Baraw revival and preservation of the establishment.
GOVERNMENT DECISION: Under this Government Decision, a Baraw Conservation Committee is being constituted with the following experts for the Baraw revival and preservation and conservation of the establishment
