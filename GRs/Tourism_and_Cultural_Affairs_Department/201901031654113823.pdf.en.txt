Government's decision:
The Maharashtra Film, Theatre and Cultural Development Corporation (MFTDC) has prepared a master plan for the construction, use and transfer of world-class filming facilities as well as tourism and entertainment facilities at Dadasaheb Phalke Chitranagari, Goregaon, Mumbai. This was approved in the meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs held on 28.11.2017. As per the decision taken by the committee, a Project Steering Committee has been formed under the chairmanship of the Chief Secretary. However, as there was some ambiguity about the jurisdiction of this committee, the matter was under the consideration of the government to bring clarity in it.
Now, under this Government decision, the Project Steering Committee is being empowered to take decisions as may be necessary in the context of implementation of the project, which will include: 1) Approval of all documents required for execution of the tender process (Bid Documents, Concessionaire Agreement, etc.), 2) Finalization of the project plan submitted by the successful bidder, 3) Completion of the tender process and submission to the Cabinet for final approval.
