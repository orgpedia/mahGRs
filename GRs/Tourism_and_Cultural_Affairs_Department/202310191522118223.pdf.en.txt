Introduction: According to Indian culture, the existence of Panchamahabhutas is very important for the creation of life. That is why in our culture, the place of these five mahabhoots in our lives has been highlighted by worshipping them. Water is one of these elements. If there is not enough clean water available for the survival of the organism, its existence can be threatened. In the recent past, natural variability has made it difficult to plan for water due to uncertainty in the amount and timing of rainfall. The state has been facing acute water shortage for the past few months. Special efforts are required to create awareness and literacy in the society regarding water availability and water use planning, avoiding wastage of water, adequate use of water, preventing pollution of natural water resources, rivers and reservoirs, protecting infrastructure, and following water related laws and rules. Keeping in view all these aspects of water and green income through rivers and water bodies, the campaign" Chala Jaanua Nadila" was launched under the" Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav" to interact with the people about the river, coordinate and learn about the river. Now, the matter of extending the committee and activities organized under this campaign was under the consideration of the government.
