The then Additional Chief Secretary (Tourism) directed to submit an issue-wise report on the issues in paragraph 4 of this government decision with details. Instructions have been issued to all District Collectors vide letter dated 20/06/2014. Accordingly, while submitting the proposal for the development of tourist places under the scheme, all the district collectors are required to submit the information in the checklist in Form' A' along with the proposal. However, it has been observed time and again that some of the Collectorates are not submitting the checklist information in Form' A' along with the proposals received by the Government or the Directorate of Tourism. Therefore, it is not clear whether the places in the proposal are tourist spots or pilgrimage sites. It is not possible to take prompt action on such proposals and place them before the State Tourism Development Committee.
2. d. The Government Decision dated 04/11/2010 provides as follows:" As the Urban Development Department and the Rural Development Department are sanctioning funds for the development of pilgrimage centres, the proposals for development works for temple shrines and pilgrimage centres (including development of the shrine complex) will no longer be accepted for the Regional Tourism Development Scheme. However, exceptions will be made for tourist-oriented pilgrimage sites where a large number of tourists from outside Maharashtra come. If it has the potential to be developed as an important tourist area, not only as a religious area, but also as an ancient, historical, scenic, magnificent, artistic area for all religions.
