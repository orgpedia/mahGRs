Director, Directorate of Archaeology and Museums vide Reference No. It has been informed in the letter that so far only 18-20 contractors from the list of names have participated in the work of the Directorate. Experienced contractors from outside Namikasu are not allowed to participate in the work of the archaeological department. So there is no competition. The scheme is only for the conservation and restoration of state protected monuments and does not include museums and development works.
Therefore, museums are facing difficulties in selecting contractors for development works.
Looking at the list of pending works of the previous year from the Directorate, it is seen that the works of certain contractors are being taken up. The government did not get the competitive rates it was expecting.
