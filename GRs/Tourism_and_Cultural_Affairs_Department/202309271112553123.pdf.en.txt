Introduction: Many episodes from the life of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj are still inspiring the people of the country and the charm of these events is in the public mind. This includes the chilling incident of Afzal Khan, the Sardar of Bijapur, killing Khan using a tiger horn in response to Khan's attack on the meeting of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and Afzal Khan during the invasion of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's Swarajya in 1659.
Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's iconic' Vaghanakha', a traditional bullock cart worn by him, has been preserved at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. The Victoria and Albert Museum has agreed to lend the tiger cub to the state on a three-year loan basis for public viewing. The government plans to display the collection in four museums- Shri Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Museum, Satara, Central Museum, Nagpur, Laxmi Vilas Palace, Kolhapur and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Museum, Mumbai. As the display, safety and travel of the tiger is a very risky and responsible task, the Director, Directorate of Archaeology and Museums has requested to form a committee for guidance regarding the arrangements of the exhibition, security etc. in connection with the exhibition. Accordingly, the government had constituted the committee.
Government Decision: Under this Government Decision, it is being approved to form a Guidance Committee for the exhibition of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's tiger' Shiv Shastra Shaurya' under the chairmanship of Principal Secretary, Cultural Affairs Department as follows.
