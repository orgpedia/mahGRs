Introduction: According to Indian culture, the existence of the Panchamahabhutas is very important for the creation of life. That is why in our culture, the place of these five mahabhoots in our lives has been highlighted by worshipping them. Water is one of these elements. If there is not enough clean water available for the survival of the organism, its existence can be threatened.
In recent times, natural variability has made it difficult to plan for water as the amount and timing of rainfall is uncertain. The state has been facing acute water shortage for the last few months. Considering the need to create awareness and literacy in the society about water availability and water use planning, avoiding wastage, adequate use of water, preventing pollution of natural water sources, rivers and reservoirs, protecting infrastructure, following water related laws and rules, special efforts are required. Keeping in view all these aspects of water and green income through rivers and water bodies, it is proposed to plan a campaign" Chala Jauniya Nadila" under the" Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav" to interact with the people about the river, coordinate and learn about the river. The formation of the committee under this campaign was under the consideration of the government.
Government Decision: Under the" Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav," under the campaign" Let's go to the river," Ma. The committee is headed by the Chief Secretary.
