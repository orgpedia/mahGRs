Introduction: The office of the Executive Editor and Secretary, Department of Tourism and Cultural Affairs, Mumbai is under the Department of Tourism and Cultural Affairs. The Bombay State Gazetteer Board was established in 1949. Darsanika Vibhag has been producing gazetteer books in Marathi and English under various series like District and State Gazetteer since the British era and Indian Freedom Movement History, Aadhar Sahitya, Swatantryaveer, Biography, Vadmay compiled by M. Gandhi. Available in paperback and e-book formats.
The gazetteer is written on the basis of information received from the offices of various government departments through correspondence, as well as on the basis of direct surveys, interviews and original reference materials available. The gazetteer is published after inspection by the members of the editorial board, officers of the office. As a result, this book is an encyclopedia. The British Gazetteer was produced in English from 1874 onwards, with a revised edition published in 1949. It was decided that the gazetteers of all the districts existing in Maharashtra since 1982-83 should be removed from Marathi and accordingly, the original district gazetteer in English was slightly modified and the Marathi texts were updated. The book covers the historical perspective of the district, the changes and far-reaching changes in the social and historical spheres. An overview of 12 different aspects of the district such as historical and cultural heritage, geography, people, economy, administration, social services, transport and communication, industries, observatories, agriculture and irrigation, back business, trade and commerce is provided on the basis of objective information. The use of this book is important for the general readers as well as for the government offices, district administration, students at the university level, professors as well as tourists from home and abroad to know the historical and cultural information of the respective areas. The gazetteer is ultimately useful in making these government originals reach out to a wider public and in making the new generation understand the historical and cultural significance of this land.
