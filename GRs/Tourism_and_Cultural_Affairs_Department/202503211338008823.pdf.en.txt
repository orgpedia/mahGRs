Child: Ma. The Chief Minister's Secretariat. Comment of 21.02.2025.
Preamble: It has been 3975 years since the birth anniversary of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. At a function held in Agra to mark the occasion, Shri. On this occasion, the Chief Minister assured, "A grand memorial will be built in the city of Agra where Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was kept under house arrest by the Government of Maharashtra, and the necessary funds will be allocated for this purpose in the budget." "Accordingly, the Department of Tourism has been directed as the nodal department. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was under enemy detention in Agra, from where he returned safely to Maharashtra very cleverly and surprisingly. The place of this historical thing is very precious in the history of Maharashtra. The Government is planning to construct a grand memorial at the site of the structure / site of the house arrest of the Maharaja at Agra, and accordingly, the following decisions are being taken.
Governance Decisions: The Maratha Empire built its empire in various parts of India during the 17th and 18th centuries. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj established Swarajya and created the state of Rayate. The Maharaja had to face many difficult challenges to create this kingdom. On occasion, some retreats were also signed. On the other hand, the "Treaty of Purandar" with Mirzaraje Jai Singh in 1665 was considered to be of similar historical importance. According to this treaty, the Maharajas returned many forts to the Mughals, and according to this treaty, Maharaj Balraj attended the Mughal court with Shambhuraje and a few select Mavalis. This time the Maharaj left the court due to the Mughal court's contempt for him and showed his self-respecting nature. However, the Maharajas were subsequently placed under house arrest at Agra by the Mughalshahi. This period was about four months.
In due course of time, the Maharaja, with his cunning and most unforgettable manner, rescued the Mavalis from this house arrest along with the child king Sambhaji Raje and returned to Maharashtra safely.
Such historical and Maharashtrian pride matters that after visiting Agra, the Marathi tourist tries to go to the place where Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj stayed under house arrest, but these tourists are not aware of it as there is no historical thing, monument, museum in this place. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj is the revered god of Maharashtra. His feat, which is extremely rare outside Maharashtra, is one of the most remarkable and studious in history. Even today, all other history researchers, including Marathi, are studying this subject. In view of this incident and the fact that the flags of the Maratha Empire were hoisted with gaiety, many places bearing witness to the valour of those great heroes are unknown outside Maharashtra. The government has consciously decided to develop such places in other states also for such a place and to preserve, promote and develop such places so that the glorious history is glorified and the legacy is passed on to the next generations.
