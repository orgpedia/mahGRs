GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: GOACHIN 2016/ P.No. 189/ P.S. 1
Mantralaya (Extension), Madame Cama Road,
Hutatma Rajguru Chowk, Mumbai- 400 032.
The date: May 22, 2018
Introduction: Keeping in view the policy of the Government on Ease of Doing Business, the following recommendations have been made in this regard: on 18.09.2015. As per the decision taken in the meeting with the Chief Minister, the government was considering to implement a single window scheme so that the permissions of various departments required for the filming of films, TV serials, commercials and documentaries etc. could be obtained in a smooth and time-bound manner.
Government Decision: Under this Government Decision, one window scheme is being implemented for permission to shoot films, TV serials, commercials and documentaries etc.
The Maharashtra Film, Theatre and Cultural Development Corporation, Dadasaheb Phalke Chitranagari, Goregaon (East), Mumbai will act as the nodal agency for the implementation of the scheme.
2) The shooting will be allowed under this scheme only if the place of filming is on government land. This scheme is not applicable for filming of private places.
The concerned producers are required to apply through online system on the web portal www. maharashtrafilmcell. com for obtaining necessary permissions for filming.
4) Once the producer checks through the online system whether the filming location for the period for which they want to film is available for that period or not, if they agree to the terms and conditions of the filming of the relevant location, and submit the required fee for the same through e-payment [the fee fixed for their filming location by the concerned government (stake holder) and the reserve amount fixed at the required location], the producers will receive the Order ID and Order Date and then the process of permission for filming will start.

5) Only after the producer has paid the required fee and received the Order ID and Order Date, their application for permission will be received on the dashboard of the web portal by the government stakeholders associated with the filming location as well as the Chitra Nagar Nigam, which acts as the controlling body.
It will be mandatory for the government agencies to approve or deny permission for filming within 7 working days from the receipt of the application of the producer (i.e. from the receipt of Order ID and Order Date).
7) Permission for filming will be granted by the Chitra Nagar Nigam (Controlling Body) within 15 working days from the date of receipt of the application of the producer, in consultation with the Government Stakeholder associated with the filming location.
After the permission of the producer for the shooting, the controlling agency will pay the amount of their fees to the government agencies related to the filming sites through e-payment within 15 working days.
9) If the permission is denied by the government stakeholder related to the filming location, the reason will be informed to the producer by the Chitranagar Corporation (Controlling Body) within 15 working days from the date of receipt of the application. The amount deposited by the manufacturer through e-payment will be refunded within the next 15 working days by e-payment excluding processing fee.
10) However, if there is no response from the Government Stakeholder despite the follow-up by the Controlling Body within 7 working days, the filming will be allowed by the Controlling Agency on the assumption that they have no objection to the filming. The list of Government agencies whose permission is required to be obtained subject to certain terms and conditions is set out in Annexure A.
At present, some government agencies do not give permission/ no-objection unless other government agencies give permission/ no-objection. However, one government agency need not depend on another government agency for granting permission/ no-objection in a single window scheme. Because the final permission for filming will be processed by the controlling body after considering the permission/ no-objection of all government agencies. Therefore, it will be necessary for every government agency to convey its approval/ objection to the regulatory body immediately without depending on the permission/ objection of other government agencies.
12) If no-objection certificate is required from different government agencies for the same place of filming, then only if all the concerned government agencies issue such a certificate.

Permission will be granted by the regulatory body within the stipulated time. However, if one of the government agencies refuses the no-objection certificate, the permission for filming at the concerned place will be informed to the producer within the stipulated time.
13) Once the permission for the shooting is granted, the producer cannot cancel the booking of the shooting and the filming fee for it will not be refunded. If the producer requests for cancellation of the application within the period from the submission of application for filming to the receipt of permission for filming, the remaining filming fee excluding the processing fee shall be refunded to the producer.
14) If the filming could not take place due to some natural disaster after the producer was allowed to shoot, the amount of filming fee will not be refunded to the producer.
15) In the case of the filming location for which the reserve amount has been paid by the producer through e-payment, the reserve amount will remain with the Chitranagar Corporation as the concerned producer is required to return the reserve amount after filming. After the completion of the filming and receiving a No-Objection Certificate from the concerned agency regarding the refund of the reserve amount, the Chitranagar Corporation will return the reserve amount to the producer within 15 working days.
16) The responsibility of successful implementation of this scheme will be of the Chitranagar Municipal Corporation as the controlling body. However, the Goregaon Chitranagari Nigam, the regulatory body, will only work to coordinate between the producer and the government. The entire responsibility of giving permission to the producer for filming will be of the concerned government agency. For this, the government agencies should carefully determine the terms and conditions for granting permission for filming at the filming location under their jurisdiction so that the permission for filming will be given to the producer according to those terms and conditions.
17) All government offices associated with the filming location must appoint a controlling officer for this scheme. The concerned Controlling Officer will be responsible for granting or denying permission within 7 working days from the receipt of the application of the producers.
18) The list of filming locations as well as the respective government stakeholders is available on the above mentioned web portal of the Single Window Scheme for Permission to Filming.
19) However, if the demand is received from the producers for the filming of new locations in addition to this list, the new location will be permanently included in the list of filming locations on the web portal with the consent of the government agency under which the new location is under the demand. Thus, it is the responsibility of the Controller to update the list of filming locations from time to time and the relevant stakeholders accordingly.

The institution will remain. Also, the new government agencies to be included in the list will have to take action according to this government decision.
The scheme is currently being implemented on a pilot basis for Mumbai city and Mumbai suburbs in the first phase. After this, the scheme will be implemented in the rest of Maharashtra in a phased manner.
(2) The City Corporation shall take steps to make financial provision for this Single Window Scheme, if required, from its own funds.
Since the scheme is being implemented on a pilot basis, if any suitable corrections, changes, corrections are to be made in it, such corrections, changes, corrections will be made by the Cultural Affairs Department from time to time. Similarly, the manufacturer shall be bound to comply with the terms and conditions laid down by the concerned departments of the Ministry. This scheme will be brought under the service guarantee act.
