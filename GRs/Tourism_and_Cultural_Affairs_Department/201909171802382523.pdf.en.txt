The Proposal:
Just as the state government gives subsidy to Marathi film production, the scheme of providing subsidy to the theatre production houses for the production of new plays has been implemented under the aforesaid No. It was established by the Government Decision dated 2 March 2006. To prepare the rules for sanctioning grants for new theatrical productions under this scheme, the aforesaid No. The Committee was constituted under the Government Resolution dated 4th September, 2006.
2. Grants to Theatre Producing Societies for new theatre productions, the norms of grants were decided keeping in view the status of the theatre institution while giving grants under the scheme. However, while reviewing the scheme at the government level, it was felt that the quality of plays needs to be taken into consideration while giving subsidy for production of plays. Similarly, not every play that applies for a grant needs to be considered, but only the plays of the new theatrical code need to be considered. So that the process of introducing new concepts, new subjects in the form of drama and creating new writers gets a real boost.
Since the grant is meant to promote the process of producing quality new code plays, it would be appropriate to give subsidy only to quality plays.
3. It is not only appropriate to give this grant to professional theatre organizations, but also to consider experimental plays which are not for commercial purpose but for out-of-the-box theatre experiments. Considering these aspects, in the Rules of this Scheme, the above mentioned No. 3 This was amended by the Government Decision dated 28th October 2013.

In view of the demand made from time to time by the theatre organizations and senior theatre workers to amend certain conditions in the rules of the scheme while implementing both the schemes of the Government Decision dated 19th January, 2016 for implementing the scheme of' Grant for New Theatre Production to Theatre Production Organizations', the Government was considering the matter of formulating revised rules by superseding the said Government Decision.
