Government Resolution No: PUSM-2022/ P.S.No.11/ P.S.C.3
Director, Directorate of Archaeology and Museums vide Reference No. The letter dated 7th and 8th states that only 14-15 architects from Namikasuchi have participated in the work of the Directorate so far. Experienced architects from outside Namikasu can not participate in the work of the archaeological department. So there is no competition. Also, the scheme is only for the conservation and restoration of state protected monuments and does not include museums and development works.
Therefore, there are difficulties in choosing an architect for the development of museums.
The nominal list creates a monopoly of certain architects without getting the competitive rates expected by the government. The government will suffer financial loss. Also, renowned and experienced architects outside of Namikasu do not get the highest quality of work as they cannot participate in the tender. Therefore, the nomination of the architect should be cancelled and the appointment of the architect through open tender should be approved.
Similarly, necessary amendments should be made in the draft tender regarding the qualification and criteria of the architect.
(3) Therefore, on the recommendation of the Directorate of Archaeology and Museums, it is decided to cancel the nomination of the architect from the Directorate of Archaeology and Museums and appoint the architect through open tender and to incorporate the revised criteria and procedures in the tender process. The decision was approved by the government. Now in reference No. 9 The matter of revising the government decision here was under the consideration of the government.
Government Decision: In pursuance of this Government Decision No. 9 The Government decisions here are being superseded and orders are being issued afresh as follows: Reference No. The Nomination of Architects constituted for the works of the Directorate of Archaeology and Museums by the Government Decision No. 1 to 6 is hereby cancelled. Also, approval is being given to appoint Architects through open tender for the works of State Protected Monuments and Museums in the Directorate.
2. It is being approved to incorporate the criteria and procedure as per Annexure-I to Annexure-IV in the tenders for appointment of Architects through open tender.
Public competitive bidding for selection of architects for preparation of comprehensive conservation development plan should be done by adopting the prevailing method of Envelope-1 (technical) and Envelope-2 (financial). In this, envelope-1 should be opened first. In the eligibility criteria, the conservation architect will be able to participate in the tender process of an architect having educational qualification and experience in similar works only. Architects who qualify in the technical aspects like income tax registration etc. will have to make a presentation about the project to be taken up before the authorized competent authority/ committee. Only those architects who score 75 out of 100 or more in the technical examination should open the envelope-2. After opening the envelope-2 (financial), the architect (L-1) with the lowest financial rate (minimum) should be selected.

Government Resolution No: PUSM-2022/ P.S.No.11/ P.S.C.3
The prevailing practice of inviting open competitive bids for selection of architects for the actual conservation and development work should be adopted by invoking envelope-I (technical) and envelope-II (financial).
Envelope-1 (Technical) should be opened first. Firstly, only those architects who have the educational qualification of Conservation Architect and experience in similar works will be able to participate in the tender process. Envelope-2 of the architect fulfilling the prescribed eligibility criteria should be opened. In envelope-2 (financial), the architect should mention the percentage (consultancy fee) based on the rough budget. As per the Government decision dated 28.01.2013, the consultancy fee has been fixed at 7%. Based on this, a maximum of 7% advisory fee will be admissible. Tenders of architects quoting less than 1% consultancy fee should be rejected. After opening the envelope-2 (financial), the architect (L-1) with the lowest percentage (consultancy fee) (minimum) should be selected.
5. The Director, Directorate of Archaeology and Museums shall, in accordance with this order, call for public competitive bids by amending the tender format.
