Read:- 1) Government Decision, Tourism and Cultural Affairs Department No. Nania 2012/ Q. No.250/ S.C. 4, dated 19th January, 2016
2) Letter No. 4061 of the Directorate of Cultural Affairs,
Dated December 30, 2017
Preamble: As per the decision of the Government dated 19th January, 2016, the revised Rules of the Scheme for Grant of Grants for use of Theatre to Theatre Producing Organizations have been framed. Accordingly, the play" Ananya" has been accorded" A" status as per the letter of Directorate of Cultural Affairs dated 30th December, 2017.
According to the rules, the plays eligible for the grant have to submit evidence of 100 experiments according to the terms and conditions of the Drama Production Grant Scheme within one year from the date of the letter 10, 25, 40 and 25. However, due to the injury of the actress who played the main role in the play" Ananya," it was not possible for her to experiment with the play" Ananya" on medical advice. Therefore, Sudhir Bhat Theatre, Mumbai was unable to perform 100 experiments of the play" Ananya" in the stipulated time. However, in order to promote good drama, good code and good acting, the government was considering granting extension to the institution for the play" Ananya" by forgiving the delay caused by unavoidable reasons for the presentation of the play. Accordingly, the government has taken the following steps:
Government Decision: The play" Ananya" by Sudhir Bhat Theatre, Mumbai is being given extension of 2 months beyond 29th December, 2018 as a" special case" for submission of 100 experiments for grant under the scheme" Grant for use of theatre to production houses."
This case should not be taken as a precedent.
