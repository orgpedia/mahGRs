Preamble: With regard to appointment of contractors through open tender by cancelling the nomination of contractors in the Directorate of Archaeology and Museums and amendment in the tender format, Reference No. Detailed guidelines have been issued as per Section 1. The Directorate had floated a tender for the conservation and preservation works of the State Protected Monuments, which were administratively approved by the Government. According to the guidelines, the envelope number 2 of contractors who score 75 or more out of 100 in the technical examination in the tender should be opened. However, since the tenders published by the Directorate are found to be getting less than 75 marks in the technical examination, the Directorate has proposed to amend the provisions regarding the score in the guidelines as well as to increase the qualifying marks to 70 or more instead of 75. Letters 2, 3 and 4 have been submitted to the Government for approval.
2. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) does not undertake maintenance and restoration work of protected monuments. Only construction material and labour supply is being done by inviting tenders. Therefore, no information can be given to the contractor. As a result, he gets 0 out of 20 marks for items at Annexure-I. In Annexure-II, A. No. 2, the work done by the tenderer to the Archaeological Department of the State Government in the last five years, the amount of work done, for this a rating has been fixed out of 20. The contractor is also not able to give information about the last three out of the last five years as no work has been done due to Covid-19. As a result, he is not getting the required marks, the directorate has clarified in the proposal.
