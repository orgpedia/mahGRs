The Proposal:
Tourism is a major driver of economic growth. Tourism business has the potential to create a large number of highly skilled to unskilled jobs. Promotion of tourism will lead to economic growth of the tourism sector along with earning of foreign exchange. Considering all the above objectives, the Government of Maharashtra has announced the Tourism Policy 1999, Tourism Policy 2006 and Tourism Policy 2016 under the above Government decision. In these government decisions, the eligibility criteria, financial incentives and the implementation mechanism for implementing this scheme have been explained. Accordingly, the financial incentives to the eligible sections under Tourism Policy 2006 and Tourism Policy 2016 have been mentioned. While the fiscal incentives in Tourism Policy 2006 are for exemption from levy of various taxes, the fiscal incentives in Tourism Policy 2016 are for exemption from levy of Value Added Tax and various other taxes.
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime has been implemented across the country with effect from July 1, 2017. Concessions/ refunds given to tourism units under the Tourism Policy have been abolished with the inclusion of luxury tax, entertainment tax and value added tax in the Goods and Services Tax (GST), therefore, the tax concessions given to tourism units under the Tourism Policy cannot be given after the adoption of the GST regime as there is no provision for exemption from tax in the GST regime. Therefore, the tourism units have to pay the Goods and Services Tax. As per the Tourism Policy, the policy was to exempt the tourism units from tax, the Government was considering to provide the refund of State Goods and Services Tax applicable on the transactions on which these units were getting tax exemption after the adoption of the Goods and Services Tax system as subsidy amount.
