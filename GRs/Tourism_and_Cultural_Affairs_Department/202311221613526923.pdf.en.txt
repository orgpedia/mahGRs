The 100th All India Marathi Natya Sammelan was organized by the Akhil Bharatiya Marathi Natya Parishad during the financial year 2019-20.

Now, the 100th Marathi Natya Sammelan is being organized and the matter of providing grants to this Sammelan was under the consideration of the government.
Government Decision: Under this Government Decision, a grant of Rs. 9,33,96, 000/- (Rupees Nine Crores Thirty Three Lakhs Ninety Five Thousand only) is being sanctioned for the 100th All India Marathi Theatre Conference to be held in the financial year 2023-24 for the following activities:
