The Proposal: -
Shewata is a village 20 km northwest of Paithan Ihara in Paithan taluka of Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar district. I was on the north bank of the Godavari river in the distance. The village was shifted as it falls under the catchment area of the Jayakwadi Project Scheme. Along with the migration of the village, the temple structures that were submerged in the project of Hemadpanthi Temple in 13/14 Hathaka, which were to be displaced in the watershed, were shifted to the Golden Palace area of Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar in the year 1973 with a view to reconstructing the migration. Expanded in 1973 from the Jayakwadi catchment area, this Shiva temple at Shovata and Savkheda is in the Hemadpanthi style representing Maratha architecture, with craftsmanship from Shevata. Overall, the Vastu ruins bear witness to the grandeur of the then architectural style. The relocation of the monument from the Jayakwadi catchment area by this division is the first time in Maharashtra, and probably the second such relocation in India and Asia.
The ruins of the Mahadev temple at Shevata and Savkheda, which were recently rehabilitated from the Jayakwadi catchment area, have been kept in the Golden Palace area and the ruins are being eroded by the heat and wind. The fear of the temple ruins becoming extinct in the future cannot be ruled out.
Therefore, the government was considering giving administrative approval to the budget for the reconstruction work of the Mahadev Temple at Showata, which had been completed from the Jayakwadi catchment area.
The Government's Decisions:
Under this government decision, the reconstruction work of the Mahadev Temple at Shahovata, which has been fully rehabilitated from the Jayakwadi catchment area, has been completed at a cost of Rs. A budget of Rs. 3,56,93, 747 / - (Rupees Three Crore Fifty Six Lakh Ninety Nine Thousand Seven Hundred and Forty-seven only) is being given administrative approval.
