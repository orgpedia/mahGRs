Introduction: The State Government has been implementing the scheme of" Honouring the Eminent Litterateurs and Artists of the State" since 1954-55. In 2014, the government increased the amount of funding under the scheme. The government has pointed out that the current threshold of 60 for the selection of awardees is low due to the large number of senior artists. Considering the rising inflation in the last 5 years and the demands received from the people's representatives, artists and various artists' organizations regarding the increase in thematic honorarium, the government was considering increasing the honorarium and honorarium every year.
The government has decided to increase the honorarium from 60 to 100 per year in each district under the scheme" Qualified Older Literary and Artisan of the State." This decision will come into effect from the date of notification.
The honorarium will be paid to the eligible beneficiaries in the state till date as well as to the beneficiaries who will be eligible in the limit of 100 in the future as follows.
