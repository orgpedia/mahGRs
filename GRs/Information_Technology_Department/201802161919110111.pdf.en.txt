Introduction
The Indian financial services sector has undergone a considerable transformation in the past few years with the growing popularity and acceptance of FinTech products and services. 'FinTech' describes any business that aims at providing financial services by making use of innovative technology.
The 'Digital India Campaign' launched in July 2015, by the Government of India has provided the much-needed push towards a digital ecosystem. With an ambitious goal to make India a 'cashless economy', the Government of India has introduced United Payments Interface (UPI) and Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM) to support digital payments. This convergence of financial services and exponential technologies has resulted in FinTech having an increasingly important role to play.
Customers across the globe have been open to adopting new products and channels, often introduced by FinTech start-ups. Additionally, FinTech is unbundling traditional banking services in order to specialize in certain areas. New age start-ups are providing both traditional and innovative products, with an enhanced value proposition such as ease of use, enhanced user interface, low cost, etc.
Directorate of Information Technology (DIT) has studied the best practices in the Fintech sector with a focus on Government and regulatory support. Globally, the initiatives taken by regulators and Governments in the FinTech sector include infrastructure support, setting up of regulatory sandboxes, adoption of open APIs by banks and building FinTech bridges with global hubs. Based on the above and given the vast potential of FinTech in the Banking, Financial Services & Industries sector, the Cabinet has approved the Fintech policy of the State with a view to promote the Fintech sector in the State of Maharashtra. As part of this policy, a Global Fintech Hub will be established as a focal point for FinTech activity within the State of Maharashtra. The approval of the Fintech policy and issue of instructions for operationalization of the same was under the consideration of the Government.
