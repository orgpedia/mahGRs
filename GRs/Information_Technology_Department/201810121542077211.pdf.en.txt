Background
The Government of Maharashtra have a number of welfare schemes
which provide benefits, subsidies and services to the citizens of the State.
Many of these schemes include financial benefits to the eligible applicants.
Direct Benefits Transfer has been adopted by the Government to ensure that
benefits are transferred to the beneficiary's bank account electronically,
thereby, minimising the various tiers involved in fund flow and ensuring timely
and quick payment, accurate targeting of the beneficiary and curbing pilferage
and duplication.
Maharashtra State Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) and Services portal has been
envisaged as an integrated state vide portal with the primary objective of
disbursing benefits and subsidies and delivering services to the intended and
eligible beneficiaries of various departments of the State. The benefits or
subsidies will be electronically transferred to the beneficiaries' Aadhaar
(Unique ID) Linked Bank Accounts.
1. In Phase I, 39 scholarship schemes across 6 Departments have been on
boarded on the State DBT and Services Portal, enabling registration,
eligibility check, application submission, application scrutiny and
approval, Treasury bill generation and disbursement of funds to
beneficiary accounts.
The 6 Departments are:
Social Justice and Special Assistance

In order to implement seamless integration with BEAMS and to ensure

Maharashtra State DBT Portal,

with the Treasury Systems
c. Identify scheme wise Drawing & Disbursement Officer (DDO) and
register them with BEAMS
d. Open Scheme wise/specific Bank accounts
e. Register the scheme wise/specific account in BEAMS against the
scheme with the help of Treasury Officers. This is required so that the
DDO can choose the scheme specific account via a drop-down and
funds can be transferred by Treasury to the required and chosen
scheme specific account.
4. As decided in the DBT Cell meeting, Treasury Bills shall be generated in
Maharashtra DBT Portal for the on-boarded schemes, as per prescribed
and applicable format of Maharashtra Treasury Rules.
5. As per the Treasury rules, the Bill and the generated documents shall be
submitted to the Treasury Offices for approval and obtaining payments
in registered bank accounts.
6. Once the Bill is received from the Departments, after required
processing and approval, the Treasury officer shall transfer the approved
amount of fund to the scheme specific Bank account, which is registered
in BEAMS by the respective Department.

account from Treasury, the DDO shall transfer the said amount to the

"Central Pool Account", the applicant shall be getting a notification from
the DBT portal so that the applicant can redeem the e-Voucher and avail
Direct Benefit disbursements to either his/her Aadhaar linked Bank
account or directly to the respective authorised Institution/Agency's
account based on the nature of the application.
9. Once applicant clicks on the Redeem button, disbursement is initiated
and the benefit shall be transferred to the respective Beneficiary or
authorised Institution/Agency's account through Public Financial
Management System (PFMS). The payment file which is sent from the
DBT portal to PFMS shall contain authorisation of Principal Secretary, IT
in the form of his DSC authentication and the same file shall be sent to
Central Pool Account Bank, so that the bank can finally cross check the
authentication and can transfer the benefit to the beneficiary account.
10. The approved applicants against whom the Treasury Bills are generated
are validated and registered on PFMS, through a Beneficiary Registration
Process. Applicant details are sent to PFMS in the prescribed format
which are then validated and registered. Reconciliation and handling of
unsuccessful/failure cases will be done by the Maharashtra DBT Portal.
