Introduction: The Government of Maharashtra has a number of welfare schemes to provide benefits, financial assistance and services to the citizens of the state. Many of these plans offer financial benefits to eligible applicants. The Government has developed MahaDBT system for direct disbursement of benefits to Aadhaar seeded bank accounts of beneficiaries and it has become operational (Go Live) from October 2018.
The modalities of distribution of benefits through MahaDBT system have been worked out as per the decision of the Government in the above context. A proposal to amend the procedure was under the consideration of the government as it was felt that it needed to be changed to make it easier. Accordingly, the following orders are being issued to improve the functioning of MahaDBT system delivery.
Government Decision: The Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) system for distribution of benefits, financial assistance and services in the State has been operationalized in October, 2018. The mechanism for disbursement of benefits through this system has been laid down under the Government decision in the above context. Since this delivery mechanism needs to be improved to make it more accessible. On the 27th September 2021. The decision to revise the distribution system was taken at a high-level committee meeting chaired by the Chief Secretary. In pursuance of this decision, paragraphs 8 and 9 of the relevant Government Decision are being amended as follows:
8.- When the Drawing and Disbursing Officer receives funds from the Treasury in the" Specific Scheme Account" account, he shall deposit the funds in the" Central Pool Account" of the Department. For this, the departments should open a separate account for each scheme in the State Bank of India. As State Bank of India is linked to both MahaDBT portal and Public Financial Management System (PFMS), it is necessary to open an account with the same bank.

GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: DBT-2021/ Q. No.61/ SE- 1/39
Departments should use the said" Central Pool Account" account only for disbursement of benefits to beneficiaries through MahaDBT portal and this account should be linked to PFMS.
The disbursement process will start after the funds are credited to the scheme-wise Central Pool Account of the Department and the benefit amount will be credited to the account of the beneficiaries through Public Financial Management System (PFMS). The funds sent to the PFMS through the MahaDBT portal must be authenticated in the form of a Digital Service Certificate (DSC) by the Drawing and Disbursing Officer of the Planning Department. The amount sent to PFMS should also be sent to State Bank of India so that the authentication can be re-verified and the benefit can be disbursed to the beneficiaries.
