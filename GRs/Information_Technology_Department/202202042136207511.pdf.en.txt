Ministry, Mumbai- 400032.

Reference: 1) In-principle approval of the High Powered Committee in its meeting dated 27th September, 2021
dated 23rd December 2021. The project was approved at a Cabinet meeting.
The Proposal:
At present, fresh surveys have to be conducted to create a database of beneficiaries every time for planning and implementation of schemes of the departments. Even though each department has a large database, it cannot be linked with the database of other departments.
Various schemes are implemented by the government and help is announced for the citizens in the event of natural disasters. However, the implementation of these schemes faces major challenges such as identifying eligible beneficiaries, providing them assistance through DBT system.
Considering the experience of various schemes successfully implemented by the Department of Information Technology for many departments and the difficulties faced in helping citizens during natural disasters, the government was considering to implement the scheme of Maharashtra Unified Citizen Data for Digital Delivery of Benefits and Services to create a centralized data hub containing all the details of the citizens of the state. According to the on the 23rd of December 2021. The proposal was approved at a Cabinet meeting. The objective of this scheme is to collect and validate the data of citizens from various departments and other government agencies so that a record of every citizen is created.
Government's decision:
The government has allocated Rs 294.02 crore (excluding GST) for the implementation of the Maharashtra Unified Citizen Data for Digital Delivery of Benefits and Services scheme.
