The Proposal:
The implementation of the prestigious MahNet (Bharat Net- Phase 2) project is being provided to about 13000 Gram Panchayats in the State through High Speed Internet Connectivity State Lead Model. The project will be implemented by the Maharashtra Information Technology Corporation (MahaIT), a 100% state-owned company. MahaIT will continue to function as a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) and Project Implementing Agency (SIA). For this project, air routes will be used using fibre cable (for about 70% of Gram Panchayats) and power storage and distribution network for the remaining Gram Panchayats. As part of the project, 12,740 gram panchayats in 172 talukas in 26 districts will be connected. More than 50,000 km of fibre cable will be laid for this. A robust ICT backbone will be established in a time-bound manner with a scalable future (IP-MPLS based) network with telecom carrier-grade capacity and reliability along with state-of-the-art optical fiber. The project will ensure parallel connectivity to government offices and point-of-presence (POPs) from Gram Panchayats to respective taluks as per availability. MahNet is an" important public purpose project" which will help in enabling delivery capacity of e-governance services for public purpose projects like e-health, e-education, e-agriculture, etc.
Along with the rural Mahanets, the urban Mahanets will be an" important public purpose scheme."
It aims to provide high-speed connectivity through bandwidth connectivity to provide services at the lowest cost, point-to-point and internet bandwidth along with broadband connectivity to various departments of the government, urban local bodies, municipal corporations, all municipalities at the lowest cost, so that governance services such as G2C services (e-health, e-education, etc.), as well as G2G services (e.g. It will be possible to provide e-data administration and access, collection of payments). It will leverage the network advantage of existing telecom service providers in a faster, easier and less expensive manner and support government connectivity to all current and future requirements to enhance their reach across cities and villages.
