Introduction 1. Information about government schemes is being made available through various government websites so that citizens can get government services at home. Although the citizens are getting the benefit of these, the government has come to the notice that the disabled people have to face many difficulties while using websites and computer systems. The Bombay High Court has directed the government to make all government websites accessible to the disabled. There is a need to guide the developers of websites and computer systems to ensure that the benefits of government schemes reach the disabled people and digital inclusion of the disabled people in government projects. The guidance to the developers of websites and computer systems will facilitate the use of mobile systems, websites and computer systems by the general public as well as persons with disabilities, and enable everyone to access the digital facilities of the government.
Circular 2. The development of computer sites and computer systems for digital inclusion of persons with disabilities in the information and telecommunication projects being implemented in the State should be done in accordance with the universal design.
For this, developers need to follow the following guidelines while developing websites and mobile and computing systems.
The developer should strictly adhere to the international standards of WCAG 2.0 Level AA for digital accessibility as well as the GIGW guidelines of the Government of India for the universal design of websites, mobiles and computer systems.
Developers should provide digital accessibility to websites, mobile and computer systems.
The specifications required under WCAG 2.0 Level AA for developing websites, mobile and computer systems are as per Annexure 1 and GIGW guidelines are as per Annexure 2. These guidelines should be strictly followed by the developers. The responsibility of development in accordance with these guidelines will be of the concerned departments/ offices.
As per the directions of the High Court, all the departments should update their websites and their subordinate offices in accordance with these specifications within 2 months and submit a report to the Directorate of Information Technology.
