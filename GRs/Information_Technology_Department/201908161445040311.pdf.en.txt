Government Resolution No: GAD-Month 2018/ S.No.21/ S- 2/39
Hutatma Rajguru Chowk, Madam Cama Road
Mantralaya, Mumbai- 400032
Date: 16th of August 2019
Reference: Minutes of the meeting of the High Level Committee dated 5th August, 2019.
The Proposal:
At present, several computerization programmes/ projects are underway in the State Governments and local bodies for the past several years. All these projects were undertaken in silos over a period of time and they are all on different platforms written in different coding methods in different computational languages. As a result, different platforms have different data structures. And the information in the different sections is not interconnected. As a result, it has not been possible to provide information of all the departments together to the citizens, due to which they are facing a lot of trouble. Secondly, in the absence of collation of information of various departments, a lot of time is wasted in getting information that is already available with the government but is scattered across various departments. Therefore, the government was considering to implement the Data Standardization and Interoperability and Digital Services Delivery Project in order to provide better and quick service to the citizens by providing this information on a single platform by authenticating the information available with various departments of the government.
Accordingly, the High Level Committee for implementation of the project in its meeting held on 5th August, 2019 has sanctioned Rs. A sum of Rs 113.06 crore has been sanctioned. The General Administration Department (Information Technology), Office-39 will provide all the necessary expenses for the development of this project. The high-level committee has approved the Detailed Project Report (DPR) of the Data Standardization and Interoperability and Digital Services Delivery project.
The project is being implemented by the Maharashtra Information Technology Corporation (MahaIT). MahaIT will function as a Project Implementation Agency.
In line with the above proposal, the Data Standardization and Interoperability and Digital Services Delivery project will be implemented.
