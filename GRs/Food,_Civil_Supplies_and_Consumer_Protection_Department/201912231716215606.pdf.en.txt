Government circular:
""" For Kharif Marketing Season 2019-20 and Rabi Marketing Season 2020-21, under the Minimum Support Price (MSP) procurement scheme,"""" the Government has decided to implement the"""" Decentralized Procurement Scheme"""" throughout the State.""" The guidelines have been issued in accordance with the government decision of 1. Accordingly, the procurement of paddy under this scheme should be started along with the procurement. Paddy is to be ploughed by the agent agency (The Maharashtra State Co-operative Marketing Federation, Mumbai and Maharashtra State Co-operative Tribal Development Corporation Limited, Nashik) as per the norms prescribed by the Central Government.
In order to implement the above schemes effectively, the following additional instructions are being issued.
Accordingly, it is mentioned in paragraph 4 (ii) of the above circular that the District Coordination Committee has to decide whether the millers who have ploughed the paddy efficiently in the previous season should be given the work of ploughing the paddy by renewing the contract of the previous year only if the millers are not in arrears. Also, such documents should be made available only if other documents are required in addition to those provided by the millers in the previous year after the decision to renew the same.
Also, what is mentioned in this paragraph about taking the" electricity payment for the last 3 months in the name of the mill." It is clarified that this condition will be applicable only to the millers who were engaged in paddy milling till last year and who have started a new mill this year. In the case of those millers, if other terms and conditions are fulfilled, they should decide to start paddy milling work and the power payment from the period after the paddy milling starts in their mill should be made available by those millers after receiving the power from the power company.
Also, in the same paragraph, it is clarified that the reference to the" Audited Statement for the last 3 years" is made to those who have done new paddy ploughing work this year but who have done it in the same year.
