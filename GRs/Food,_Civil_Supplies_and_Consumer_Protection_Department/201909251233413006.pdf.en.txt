Government circular
Government Resolution No. 1017/ P.S. No. 140/ NAPU-29 dated 4th October, 2017.
Government circular:
The Minimum Support Price (MSP) scheme is a 100% centrally sponsored scheme. The guidelines for expenditure on each of these aspects have been given by the Central Government and a provisional cost sheet is approved every season. However, at the level of agents and sub-agents, the instructions of the Central Government and the provisions of the cost-sheet are not being followed.
It has also been observed that the funds allocated for certain items in the cost-sheet have not been spent by the agent agencies for that matter till date. Moreover, the criteria for some items have been changed without the prior consent of the Central Government and the expenditure has been spent accordingly. Hence, it will not be reimbursed by the central government. Also, the money given for the farmer's contribution is used for other things, due to which the farmers have to face the anger of the farmers due to the non-payment of farmers on time. The adjustment of the advance given for this scheme is not done by the agent agencies for 2 to 3 years. The Chief Minister has also objected to it. After the end of every season, the account of the purchase and sale and the amount spent is not finalized by reconciling that season with the government.
The Central Government has not been able to submit the audited statements due to non-accounting for one year. Therefore, in order to streamline the matter and to ensure that the expenditure on all aspects as per the directions of the Central Government is reconciled with the Government for each season and the expenditure is completed within six months from the end of the season, the following modalities are being worked out.
Procedure for item-wise expenditure in the cost-sheet and submission of accounts:
(1) Old and New:
As per the central government's guidelines, 4 gunny bags of 50 kg each should be used for 1.50 quintal of paddy. 2 new ones and 2 old ones. From this 1.50 quintals of paddy, 1 quintals of CMR will be produced. The 2 new gunny bags used for paddy procurement should be reused for filling CMR.
