Ministry (Extension), Mumbai.
The date is May 24, 2023.
The Proposal:
The Minimum Support Price (MSP) procurement scheme is a Central government scheme for the benefit of farmers. Under this scheme, the central government announces the minimum support price for various crops and the state government procures paddy so that the farmers do not have to sell the grain at a lower price than the guaranteed price in order to benefit from the base price.
The Food Corporation of India (FCI) is the nodal agency for the central government in the state of Maharashtra, while the Food Corporation of India (FCI) implements the scheme through two agent agencies, namely, State Government Marketing Federation, Mumbai (non-tribal area) and Tribal Development Corporation, Nashik (tribal area).
It is mandatory to submit information regarding paddy/ coarse grains procurement, paddy loading, accumulating CMR, lifting (by Food Corporation of India and lifting of CMR) and CMR/ coarse grains to the Central Government in a time bound manner. However, it has been brought to the notice of the government by the Food Corporation of India, Regional Office, Borivali that there are frequent discrepancies in this information. Accordingly, the matter of setting up a Coordination Cell for coordination in this information was under the consideration of the government.
Government's decision:
A Co-ordination Cell is being set up for coordination/ coordination of information regarding procurement of paddy/ coarse grains by the department, paddy procurement, CMR accumulation, lifting (by Food Corporation of India and CMR lifting) and CMR/ coarse grain distribution.
