If the farmer of the village takes paddy/ coarse grains to another procurement center, then he should not buy his paddy/ coarse grains at that center. Collectors and procurement agencies should ensure that adequate publicity is given about the procurement centres and the names of the villages attached to each procurement centre.
The area and village-wise list of farmers attached to the procurement centres should be obtained from the Talatha and recorded in the register at the procurement centre.
If more than one village is connected to a single shopping center, such a center
Page 36 of 9.
# Page 10
Government Resolution No: Purchase-2621/ P.S. No. 138/ No. P. 29.
Keep a separate village-wise register. This register should be made available to the district supply officer at the time of inspection of the procurement center.

For online purchase, it is mandatory to register NeML NCDEX Group Company on the platform for the 2021-22 season and make the PFMS (Public Fund Monitoring System) as per the instructions of the Central Government.
7.3. It is necessary to avoid crowding at procurement centres, maintain law and order as well as to give advance warning to farmers before they come to procurement centres in the backdrop of COVID-19. For this, farmers should be given prior information through SMS on mobile (from NeML portal) under this scheme on the lines of NAFED.
7.4 The agent agency should register the farmers and purchase paddy/ coarse grains only by viewing the online 7/12 extract of the farmers' land on the NeML portal. If required, the purchase can be made on the basis of the digitally signed 7/12 and sample 8A obtained from the website of the Revenue and Forest Department.
If the forest land has been given to the farmers under the Forest Rights Act 2005, then the paddy should be purchased from such farmers on the basis of the government documents that have been fixed for the retention area of their land in the forest under the Forest Rights Act 2005, instead of the sample 8-A.

These should include 1) Name of the farmer, 2) Survey/ Group Number and Area, 3) Paddy/ Jowar, Bajra, Maize and Ragi brought for sale at the centre. So, once the grain is brought back, the earlier 7/12 can be extracted from this register to ensure that the farmer's grain is of his own production.
Before accepting the paddy/ coarse grains brought by truck or similar vehicle, it should be fully ensured that the paddy/ coarse grains belong to the concerned farmer.
7.6 It has been observed that in some places, paddy is procured on a very large scale (indirectly by traders) without considering the area under paddy and the average productivity. Therefore, paddy/ coarse grains should be procured by taking into account the area under the crop as per section 7/12 of the farmers, the cropping situation of this year (Paiswari) and the average production of the crop.

It shall be the responsibility of the agents not to purchase more than this limit under any circumstances. Any purchase exceeding this limit shall be the responsibility of the buyer.

For providing such information, the agent agencies should take a copy of the sample 8 (a) of their land and self-declaration of the caste of the farmers from the farmers who have purchased paddy/ coarse grains and classify the farmers into small, medium, large and caste-wise. This category is listed in Appendix No. IV form should be submitted to the government from time to time.
7.9 As per the instructions issued by the Central Government vide letter dated 02.05.2019, payment of paddy/ coarse grains procurement amount and payment of incidental expenses is mandatory through PFMS system. In this regard, the agent agencies should take care of registering all the concerned farmers by conducting a special campaign.
7.10 It should be made public that after the closure of the procurement center every evening, the responsibility of handling the paddy/ coarse grains brought to the procurement center, but not purchased, will be the responsibility of the concerned farmer. Considering the possibility of last year's paddy/ coarse grains being resold by the traders at the purchase center, the agent agencies should take special care that last year's old paddy/ coarse grains will not be purchased under any circumstances and only the new paddy/ coarse grains produced by the farmers will be purchased. If paddy/ coarse grains are purchased from old or non-farmers, the entire responsibility will be on the agent agencies.
Storage of Coarse Cereals (Jowar, Bajra, Maize and Ragi) procured: 8.1 The Coarse Cereals (Jowar, Bajra, Maize and Ragi) procured as per the specifications by the agent agencies should be taken over by the representative of the State Government, preferably on the same day, in the godown near the centre, after weighing them completely and ensuring the quality, as decided by the Collector and the same should be recorded in the godown records regularly. If required, private godowns of Central and State Warehousing Corporations/ Cooperative Societies should be taken on rent for storage. The warehouse rent will be paid at the rate approved by the Central Government for the warehouse rent in the Provisional Cost Sheet for the Kharif Marketing Season 2021-22. In exceptional circumstances
