The proposal-
The Minimum Support Price (MSP) scheme is implemented by the central government.
This scheme is implemented so that farmers do not have to sell their grain at a lower price than the guaranteed price. For this, the procurement process is carried out in the state through the agent agencies appointed by the state government (Maharashtra State Cooperative Marketing Federation, Mumbai (Markfed) in the non-tribal sector and Maharashtra State Cooperative Tribal Development Corporation, Nashik (TDC) in the tribal sector).
The Food Corporation of India (FCI) is the nodal agency for the central government in Maharashtra. The wheat procured under this scheme is deposited with the Food Corporation of India.
In the last three-four seasons, wheat has not been procured under the decentralized procurement scheme in the state.
However, in the Rabi Marketing Season 2020-21, there was a demand for wheat procurement from the Tribal Development Corporation as well as the Maharashtra State Cooperative Marketing Federation in the wake of COVID-19. On the basis of the proposal submitted to the Central Government, the state has received permission to purchase wheat under the above reference letter under the Decentralised Procurement Scheme.
Accordingly, in accordance with the directions of the Central Government regarding the procurement of wheat under the Decentralised Procurement Scheme from the Rabi Marketing Season 2020-21, as well as the decision taken in the State Cabinet meeting regarding the implementation of this scheme in the entire State, the matter of implementing the Decentralised Procurement Scheme for wheat procurement in the State was under consideration.
