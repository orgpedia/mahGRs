Government Circular No: RAVADU-2117/ P.No.157/ N.P.31
Mantralaya, Mumbai- 400 032
Date: February 2, 2022.
Reference: 1) Circular of the Government, No. August 1, 2017.
(2) Circular of the Government of the State, d. on the 8th November 2017.
The Proposal:
To ensure easy availability of ration to ration card holders under the Public Distribution System, the Ministry has issued a notification for the allotment of ration/ fair price shops and for the grant of kerosene license for the new shops. The Government Circular was issued on 01.08.2017. Accordingly, the new ration shop should be approved. 10.08.2017 to dt. The time-bound programme was fixed up to 25.10.2017.
The need for a new program:
(1) Some of the districts of the State are not able to implement the scheduled programme of ration distribution/ fair price shop clearance on time due to various reasons mentioned below- Duration of various elections and their code of conduct in the State Frequent flood-like situation in the State due to outbreak of COVID-19 disease in the State and the subsequent lockdown
(2) Therefore, it has come to the notice of the Government that there is a technical problem during the period of sanction of ration/ fair price shop.
(3) Fair Price Shops are approved in the same area as per the population/ unit number for the convenience of the ration card holders residing in that area/ circle and so that they do not have to go far to get ration.
(4) In case of cancellation of ration/ fair price shop/ death of the holder of the authorization letter, the ration card can be attached to the nearest ration/ fair price shop for a minimum period of 3 months and a maximum period of 6 months as per the prior approval of the Government.
(5) If the rationing/ fair price shop approval program is implemented twice a year, the period of stay of the shops in the connected state will also be reduced to six months.
(6) Therefore, the Government was considering to implement a time bound programme twice a year (half-yearly) for grant of new ration/ fair price shop licences.
