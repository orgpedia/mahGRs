The Proposal:
In case of death of the authorised ration/ fair price shop owner, the license (authorisation letter) in his name is cancelled. But here's the number 1. According to the provisions of paragraph 1 of the Government Decision of 12.11.1991, the heir is given first priority when issuing a new license. The number 2 is mentioned above. As per the Government Order dated 22.12.1997, it has been provided that after the death of the shopkeeper, the process of issuing license/ authorization letter in the name of his heir should be completed expeditiously and within three months.
Accordingly, if the application is filed by the heir within three months of the death of the licensee, action is taken by the concerned Controller Ration and Director Civil Supplies/ Deputy Controller Mumbai-Thane Rationing Area/ concerned Collector/ District Supply Officer/ Food Distribution Officer.
However, if the heir submits the application to the concerned Controller Ration and Director Civil Supplies/ Deputy Controller Mumbai-Thane Rationing Area/ concerned Collector/ District Supply Officer/ Food Distribution Officer after a delay of three months, such cases are received at the government level for approval. In most of these cases, it has been observed that the heirs could not submit the application within the stipulated time due to problems arising after the death of the original licensee, family and financial difficulties, ignorance, ignorance of administrative work.
In view of all the above, the proposal to amend the three-month time limit for the heir to apply to the concerned Controller Ration and Director Civil Supplies/ Deputy Controller Mumbai-Thane Ration Zone/ concerned Collector/ District Supply Officer/ Food Distribution Officer after the death of the licensee was not considered adequate and feasible.
Government's decision:
If the heir applies to transfer the license to the heir within 1 year after the death of the licensee, the proceedings on it will be taken by the concerned Controller Ration and Director Civil Supplies/ Deputy Controller Mumbai-Thane Rationing Area/ concerned Collector/ District Supply Officer/ Food Distribution Officer within the next three months.

The cases should be submitted for approval at the government level after one year. After the death of the licensee, the ration card in the area of the said ration shop should be temporarily attached to the nearest ration shop till the transfer of the license of the concerned ration shop in the name of the heir. But the process of transferring the license in the name of the heir should be done within the stipulated time. If the license of the heir could not be given for any reason, then the shop approval process should be done according to the usual procedure by taking out an advertisement.
