The Proposal:
The Government decided to procure sugar through e-auction through NCDEX Spot Exchange for distribution to eligible beneficiaries under Public Distribution System (PDS) as per the terms and conditions prescribed. Released on June 19, 2014. As this method of sugar procurement provides transparent, modern and affordable sugar to the government, it was decided to continue this method of sugar procurement through e-auction through NCDEX Spot Exchange in the Cabinet meetings held on 27/11/2014. The government has taken a decision in this regard. 197 was released on December 2014. The decision was taken by the government. Further continuation was approved as per the terms and conditions and procedures dated 19th June, 2014. As per this government decision, sugar was regularly purchased through e-auction.
As per the guidelines of the Central Government dated 01.06.2017, 1 kg sugar per month is to be distributed to Antyodaya Ration Card beneficiaries in the State. In a government decision dated 25 July 2017, it was decided to hold quarterly e-auctions once every three months instead of monthly e-auctions.
In line with the use of other portals as an alternative arrangement with the portal of the company NeML Group Company, the Government of this Department vide Decision No. Narrative 2621 / P.No.233 / No.29, D. Under the 01.02.2022, e-auction process in all districts through the Department of Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Protection at the government level has been approved using the platform of NeML Group Company as well as BSE E-AGRICULTURAL MARKTES LIMITED (BEAM).

Challenges faced in quarterly sugar e-auction at present: -
i) How much sugar is required by the field office for each quarter. Although the tender is called for, it is often not possible for the supplier to place a start order within the stipulated time frame by complying with the terms and conditions of the e-auction as the tender is not received from the field office within the stipulated time.
1) Low availability of sugar fixation has been found to result in non-receipt of remunerative prices.
iii) Practically every three months, it is not possible to complete the e-auction process in the stipulated time.
Considering all these factors, e-auctions were now being considered only once a year instead of three months.
Government Decision: - 1) From the financial year 2025-26, e-auction of sugar procurement will be conducted once in a year through the system of BSE E-Agricultural Markets Limited (BeAM).
2) The terms and conditions for this e-auction shall be as decided by the State Level Administrative Procurement Committee of the Department.
The decision is available on the Government of Maharashtra's www.maharashtra.gov.in website.
