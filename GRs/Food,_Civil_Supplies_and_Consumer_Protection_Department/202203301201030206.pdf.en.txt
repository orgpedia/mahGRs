Proposal: Decision to be made. As per the provisions of 19.04.2021, the proposals of Shiv Bhojan Kendras received by the government are approved at the government level. Instructions have been issued under the above Government decision to allow the Regional Office to start a new Shiv Bhojan Center only after ensuring that the criteria required for the Shiv Bhojan Center are met in such proposals approved by the Government. Thus, proposals for change in address of approved Shiv Bhojan centers are received by the government. The government has been directed that the concerned Shiv Bhojan center is not operational until the facts are examined and a decision is taken on it. The government also receives complaints from time to time about irregularities being found in Shiv Bhojan centers.
A decision in this regard needs to be taken at the district level itself so that timely action can be taken against such irregularities. Also, it is necessary to take a decision on the yet-to-be-defunct Shiv Bhojan centers out of the Shiv Bhojan centers approved by the government. Considering all these factors, the following recommendations have been made.
