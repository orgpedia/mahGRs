The Government has decided to implement the Decentralized Procurement Scheme in the entire State as per the directions of the Central Government from both Kharif and Rabi Marketing Season 2017-18. The government has taken a decision. The scheme is being implemented across the state. Earlier, the rice produced by the Food Corporation of India (FCI) under the Minimum Support Price (MSP) procurement scheme was stored in the godowns under its control. However, from 2016-17, the rice produced under the decentralized procurement scheme is to be deposited in the state government godowns and distributed under the targeted public distribution system. Since the Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Protection Department does not have adequate storage systems, it is necessary to take the help of other government departments and corporations for this work.
The Maharashtra State Warehousing Corporation is a public sector enterprise under the Department of Cooperation, Marketing and Textiles, Government of Maharashtra. Earlier, the Maharashtra State Warehousing Corporation (MSWMC) used to take the godowns on rent while the procurement was done through the Food Corporation of India (FCI). However, considering the above, the rates for storage of rice or other foodgrains procured by the State Government shall be lower than that of Food Corporation of India (FCI) and Maharashtra State Fertilizer Corporation (MSFCC) and the rates shall be lower than that of Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) and Food Corporation of India (FCI).

The matter of taking the godowns of the committees on lease was also under the consideration of the government. The government has taken the following decisions:
Government's decision:
During the year 2017-18, for the storage of paddy procured under the MSP scheme at various places in the State and the rice and coarse cereals (sorghum, millet and maize) obtained by milling thereof, the godowns of Maharashtra State Warehousing Corporation shall be taken on lease from Food Corporation of India and Maharashtra State Warehousing Corporation at such rates as may be lower and from the Agricultural Produce Market Committee and Food Corporation of India at such rates, subject to the following conditions:
The concerned District Supply Officer shall submit a report to the Maharashtra State Warehousing Corporation and the Agricultural Produce Market Committee at least on May 1500. It should be ensured that godowns (with all facilities) are available for storing paddy up to the capacity of one tonne. After verifying this, they should submit a reservation proposal for the available warehouse.
2. The agencies shall be fully responsible for insurance, pest control measures, security, maintenance of logs of arrivals and departures, etc. of the leased warehouses.
Before storing the goods in the rented warehouse, the quality of the goods will be certified by the Quality Controller (Q.C.) appointed by the Department and a certificate will be issued to the said institution.
After the grain is accepted by the Quality Controller (Q.C.), the actual weight of the grain while receiving the grain in the warehouse will be checked to ensure the prescribed humidity and after that it will be recorded with the joint signature of the representative of the warehouse head and the District Supply Officer. These records will be used for all future purposes.

As the Maharashtra State Warehousing Corporation is only managing the storage across the state as per the provisions of the Central Warehousing Act, 1962 and the Maharashtra Warehousing Act, it is not obligated to use the prescribed manuals for the distribution of foodgrains. Also, the directions given in the various manuals of the department will not be binding on the corporation as the corporation has its own management procedures.
Wherever possible, a contractor should be appointed for handling and transportation work by the District Supply Officer. Where the District Supply Officer is not able to arrange the handling and transportation work, the warehouse owner organization should appoint the contractors in the same way as the handling and transportation contractors are appointed for the work of the Food Corporation of India.

In such a case, after receiving these amounts from the government, the warehouse owner will be paid to the concerned contractors through the agency.
