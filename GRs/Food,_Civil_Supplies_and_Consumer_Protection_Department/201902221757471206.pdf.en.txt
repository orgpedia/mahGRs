Preamble: The project for computerization of Public Distribution System is being implemented in the State. The project will be implemented in all districts of the state. Aadhaar Enabled Public Distribution System (AePDS) has been launched on 01st May 2018. Through this system, ration is being distributed through e-PoS (Point of Sale Device) by biometric identification of eligible beneficiaries. There seems to be very little awareness among the beneficiaries about the automation of the public distribution system.
The government was considering to implement an innovative reward scheme at the district level to create awareness and empower the consumers and to make it a habit for the consumers to take the grains through e-pos and take the receipt generated by it and to make it mandatory to give the receipt to the shopkeeper.
Government Decision: The Government has decided to distribute incentive prizes to the ration card holders on the selected receipt of the receipt numbers issued after the distribution of food grains through e-PoS from the fair price shops in the state. The system developed by National Informatics Centre (NIC) is being used to implement e-PoS receipt based" Reward Scheme" in fair price shops.
The scheme of giving incentive to the selected ration card holder by implementing the reward scheme on the basis of the receipt generated through e-PoS should be implemented as follows.
The number of receipt of foodgrains delivered through e-PoS during the period specified for the prize scheme on 1st day of every month or on the date specified in that month will be selected for the prize, for which the Unique Transaction Number on the receipt for the prize will be selected through the system created by NIC.
Such prizes can be drawn only once in a month in the concerned district.
