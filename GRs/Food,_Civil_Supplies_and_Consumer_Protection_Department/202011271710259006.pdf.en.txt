Read: 1) Government Resolution No: Purchase-1014/ Q.No.17/ NAPU-29, dated 14.j. 2016 2) Government Resolution No: Purchase 1020/ Q. No.104/ NAPU-29, dated 29th September, 2020 3) Govt. NO. 157/ NAPU 29, dated 21st October, 2020 Preamble- The Government has decided to implement the Decentralized Procurement Scheme (DPS) in the entire State as per the directions of the Central Government from both Kharif and Rabi Marketing Season 2016-17. The government has taken a decision. The scheme is being implemented across the state. Earlier, the rice produced by the Food Corporation of India (FCI) under the Minimum Support Price (MSP) procurement scheme was stored in the godowns under its control. However, from 2016-17, the rice to be produced under the decentralised procurement scheme is to be deposited in the state government godowns and distributed under the targeted public distribution system. Since the Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Protection Department does not have adequate storage systems, it is necessary to take the help of other government departments and corporations for this work. The Maharashtra State Warehousing Corporation is a public sector enterprise under the Department of Cooperation, Marketing and Textiles, Government of Maharashtra. Earlier, the Maharashtra State Warehousing Corporation (MSWMC) used to take the godowns on rent while the procurement was done through the Food Corporation of India (FCI). However, considering the above, the rates for storage of rice or other foodgrains procured by the State Government shall be lower than that of Food Corporation of India (FCI) and Maharashtra State Fertilizer Corporation (MSFCC) and the rates shall be lower than that of Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) and Food Corporation of India (FCI).
