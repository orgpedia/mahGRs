Introduction:- Shiv Bhojan Yojana is an ambitious scheme of the government, through which food is provided to the poor and needy people at a discounted rate. For this, Shiv Bhojan centers are approved in the traditional way. However, after the approval of the Shiv Bhojan Center, the government receives proposals from the concerned Shiv Bhojan Center Operators/ Regional Offices regarding the transfer of the Shiv Bhojan Center to the name of the heir or other person in case of the death of the concerned Shiv Bhojan Center Driver or for any other reason. There seems to be a misconception that when a Shiv Bhojan center is approved, it is inherited for that center. Also, it is seen that if the Shiv Bhojan center is approved, then a license has been obtained, which can be transferred.
Therefore, it is necessary to clarify this. Accordingly, the following decisions are taken:
Government's decision:
1) If the Shiv Bhojan center operator is unable to run the Shiv Bhojan center or does not want to run the Shiv Bhojan center, then such Shiv Bhojan center should be canceled and the balance of that Shiv Bhojan center should be transferred to the government.
(2) If the driver of the Shiv Bhojan center or the dignitaries recommend to transfer the Shiv Bhojan center to the name of the heir or other person, then the proposals regarding the transfer of such Shiv Bhojan center to the name of the concerned person should not be submitted for the approval of the government.
3) In case of death of the Shiv Bhojan center operator, the concerned Shiv Bhojan center should be canceled and the property of the concerned Shiv Bhojan center should be transferred to the government. Such Shiv Bhojan centers should not be proposed to the government to transfer the names of heritage.

4) If the district administration is of the opinion that there is a need for a new centre in place of such cancelled/ closed Shiv Bhojan centre, then action should be taken to submit a new proposal in the prevailing manner.
