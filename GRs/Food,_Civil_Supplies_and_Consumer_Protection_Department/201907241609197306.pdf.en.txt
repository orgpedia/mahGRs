At that time, it was decided to distribute 1 kg of pulses per ration card (with a ceiling of 1 kg each) while distributing tur and gram. But now the central government has made tur available in very less quantity and gram in more quantity than before. Therefore, in order to facilitate the distribution of pulses, the government was considering allowing ration card holders to distribute a maximum of 2 kg of pulses per month per ration card as per their demand (1 kg of toor dal and 1 kg of chana dal if both pulses are required or 1 kg of toor dal if only toor dal is required or 1 or 2 kg of chana dal if only chana is required).
Accordingly, the amendment in the quantity of pulses in paragraph 2 of the Government Resolution dated 1st March, 2019 is being proposed and it is being decided to distribute 2 kg pulses per ration card per month to the beneficiaries of Antyodaya Anna Yojana and priority families in the State as follows.
Decision of the Government 1) While distributing toor dal and chana dal to the beneficiaries of Antyodaya Anna Yojana and priority families in the targeted public distribution system, the ration card holders will be given a maximum of 2 kg pulses per month per ration card as per their demand (1 kg tur dal if both pulses are required)
