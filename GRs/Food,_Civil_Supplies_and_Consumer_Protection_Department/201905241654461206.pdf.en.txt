As directed by the District Collector, the procurement agencies should open procurement centres as per the requirement to procure maize at the required places.

Procurement Period: Coarse Cereals- Maize- Dated 27th May, 2019 to 30th June, 2019
8) Method of purchase. Every village should be linked to a particular shopping centre. If the farmer of the village takes maize to another procurement center, then he should not buy maize at that center.
Collectors and procurement agencies should take care to give adequate publicity about the procurement centres and the names of the villages attached to each procurement centre.
The online procurement system has been started while buying maize from farmers. For this, the farmers need to be registered. For this, online registration, Aadhaar number and savings bank account number is being registered.
For online purchase, it is mandatory to register on the platform of NeML NCDEX Group Company and register it in PFMS (Public Fund Monitoring System) as per the instructions of the Central Government.
The purchase of maize should be done by looking at the 7/12 ratio of the land owned by the farmers.

So, as soon as the maize is brought back, by extracting the earlier 7/12 from this register, the farmer can ensure that the maize brought is of his own production. Before accepting corn brought by truck or similar vehicle, it should be fully ensured that the corn belongs to the real farmer.
V. It has been observed that in some places, maize is purchased on a very large scale (indirectly by traders) without considering the area under the grain and the average productivity. Therefore, maize should be purchased taking into account the area under the crop as per section 7/12 of the farmers, the cropping situation of this year (Paiswari) and the average production of the crop.

Warehouses of Warehousing Corporation/ Cooperative Societies should be taken on rent for storage, if required. If the need arises to store the stock in the open, before storing it, arrangements should be made to provide drainage under and around the husks of such food grains and to cover them completely with sufficient palm leaves. Also, the maize should be protected from pests by timely pivoting by a regular contractor as per the need. In any case, the maize stock stored in the open will not get wet due to rain, and the paddy stacks will not get wet from below or from the side, and even if such stock remains in the open during the rainy season, the maize outside the warehouse should be arranged for safety from the beginning. In this regard, a letter has been sent to the Government, Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Protection Department No. 1298/ 15/ PR No. 2579/ No. The Code prescribed under the Act, dated 29th August, 1998 (Annexure IV) should be scrupulously followed.
