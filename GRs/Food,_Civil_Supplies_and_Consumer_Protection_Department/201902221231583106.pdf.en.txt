Preamble: The State Government has sanctioned Rs. 450/- per kg (including deficit benefit). Further, Rs. 300/- per kg (including deficit benefit). In this regard, the Government has been receiving representations from various associations of retail/ hawkers licensees in the State regarding increase in their commission. There has been no increase in the commission of retail/ hawkers/ semi-wholesale licensees in the state since 2016. In the meanwhile, in view of the periodic increase in the commission of wholesale licensees by the Central Government, the overall increase in prices in all other sectors and the consequent need to increase the commission of retail/ hawkers licensees to make their business viable, the matter of increasing the commission of retail/ hawkers licensees in the State was under consideration of the Government.
Government Decision: As per the above mentioned background, the Government has decided to increase the commission of retail/ hawkers licensees in the State as follows.
