Introduction: Minimum Support Price Purchase Scheme is a Central Government scheme, which is implemented so that farmers do not have to sell food grains at a lower price than the guaranteed price. Under this, the" Decentralized Procurement Scheme" (DCPS) for" Paddy" has been implemented in the State from 2016-17 as per the Government Resolution No. 1. In this scheme, the Maharashtra State Co-op will be established in the non-tribal area through the agent agencies appointed by the state government. Marketing Federation, Mumbai and in tribal areas, Maharashtra State Cooperative Tribal Development Corporation, Nashik) procures paddy and millets of FAQ (Fair Average Quality) in the state.
Under the above scheme, the paddy procured from millers through agent agencies is collected and the CMR (Custom Milled Rice) is deposited in the government godowns.
The districts of Gondia, Bhandara, Gadchiroli, Chandrapur and Nagpur are the major rice producing districts in the state. Also, the cost of transportation of paddy increases according to the location of the procurement centers under the agent agencies and the geographical nature of the district.
The Department had submitted a proposal to the Finance Department to approve the budgetary provision for the transportation of paddy and CMR in the 2016-17 to 2018-19 season from the increased cost available with the Department and to provide an auxiliary subsidy equivalent to the increased cost for its reimbursement and to receive an auxiliary subsidy every year for that additional cost. Hence, the government had decided to form the committee.
