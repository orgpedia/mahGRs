6.7 The original copies of all the documents in the list of documents mentioned above shall have to be submitted by the tenderer for verification as per the instructions of the Tendering Committee, otherwise the tenderer shall be disqualified.
6.8 The Government needs to give opportunity to genuine bidders to participate in maximum number of tenders to get competitive rates. Keeping this in view, if there are any errors in the prescribed essential documents and such errors can be rectified immediately, the bidders should be allowed to rectify such errors within one week before opening the price envelope B. If such errors are not completed within the stipulated time, the tender should be disqualified.

6.10 The tender shall be disqualified if the tenderer does not submit the required documents in the envelope' A" i.e. technical envelope within the prescribed period. Since the rate envelope' B" of such tender is ineligible to be opened, the tenderer's written or oral request to open the rate envelope' B" and to consider the rate therein shall not be entertained under any circumstances.
6.11 If, after the opening of Technical Envelope A during the tendering process, there is no objection from the tenderer regarding the Technical Envelope, the same shall be in writing as to the absence of objection from all the eligible bidders.

If less than three technically qualified bids are received even after the first tender or extension, a re-tender should be called for.
6.14 If more than three qualified bids are not received despite two rounds of tendering and less than 3 but at least 1 qualified tender is received after two extensions given to the third re-tender, further proceedings for opening of envelope A shall be taken up at the Government level.

Government Resolution No. 1120/ Contract No. 106/ No.P.S. 16-A
7.1.2 The State Level Committee shall study the tender proposal in detail and thereafter approve the final tenders.
(8) Legality of Tender Rates: 8.1 The tenderer shall specify the rates in the tender keeping in view all the provisions of the Government Order. Any changes or requests will not be considered.
8.2 The tender documents of all the bidders shall remain valid for a period of 120 days from the date of opening of the tender.
8.3 However, in case of a court case arising out of this period, the time taken for the tender process shall be excluded.
(9) Guidelines for Negotiations: 9.1 Under no circumstances should negotiations be encouraged after competitive bidding.
Negotiations send the wrong message to the market and can lead to doubts about the tender mechanism. Therefore, no tender should be negotiated with any bidder other than L-1. However, negotiations with L-1 tenderer can also be done only in the following circumstances.
9.1.1 If the rates are untenable or higher than the market prices, 9.1.2 if the bidders are suspected to have formed a cartel, 9.1.3 if it has not been possible to evaluate at least 3 valid commercial bids in the tender process.
9.2 Negotiations should not be misused. Negotiating with an L-1 bidder with questionable intent can result in a delay in decision-making. The recommending authority for negotiation must provide reasons that can be convincing. In any case, it should be ensured that the tenders are finalised within their validity period.
9.3 Negotiations should be conducted by the entire tender committee and not by individuals. Documents of the negotiation process should be preserved. The tenderer shall submit his negotiated offer in writing to the Tender Committee.
10.1 After receiving the approval of the Government, the approved tenderer is required to complete all the documents within 7 days after the approval of the tender and sign the contract in the prescribed format on a stamp paper of Rs.100/-.
10.2 All the provisions of this Government Decision shall apply to the contract entered into with the tenderer who has been approved by the tender process announced in accordance with this Government Decision. This should be mentioned in the contract.
10.3 The agreement must be signed by the Collector/ Controller Ration/ District Supply Officer/ Deputy Controller Ration and the tenderer.
10.4 Every page of the agreement and at the place of amendment shall be signed by the Collector/ Controller of Ration/ District Supply Officer/ Deputy Controller of Ration and the tenderer.
10.5 If the approved tenderer refuses to sign the contract within the stipulated time or fails to sign the contract, a fresh tender process shall be carried out by forfeiting the entire bid amount of such tenderer. In such re-tendering process, the first minimum bidder who refuses to sign the contract in the first tender shall be debarred for one year.
10.6 However, in case the first tenderer is unable to conclude the contract within the stipulated time due to some technical reasons and after the stipulated time but before the commencement of the new tender process, all the documents should be completed.

Government Resolution No. 1120/ Contract No. 106/ No.P.S. 16-A
If at least the tenderer is willing to enter into an agreement, an agreement should be entered into with such tenderer.
10.7 After submission of the tender, the tenderer shall be bound by the provisions of the tender as well as the contract.
If the tenderer with the lowest rate refuses to sign the contract or does not work due to delay or order, the Government shall recover the additional amount to be spent by the tenderer along with the interest at the" Prime Lending Rate plus two per cent" of the State Bank of India.
(11) Duration and Extension of Contract: 11.1 The tenderer shall enter into a contract for transportation for a period of three years. The period of contract shall be for a period of three years from the date on which the agreement is entered into with the tenderer.
11.2 If the new contract cannot be fixed even after the expiry of the contract period due to some unavoidable circumstances or due to a court case, the concerned Collector/ Controller, Rationing Department at the district level will have the right to extend the contract period up to 2 months.
11.3 If after the extended period of 2 months, it is not possible to finalize the contract for the next period due to some unavoidable reasons, the decision to extend the contract period till that period will be taken at the government level. For this, the Collector/ Controller of Ration, should send the necessary proposal to the government without any delay.
(12) Responsibilities of District Supply/ Controller Rationing Office after approval of tender: 12.1 After finalization of the transport tender, the transport contractor shall be assigned the routes for transportation of foodgrains. Traffic routes should be specifically earmarked for Phase-II/ Direct Traffic. Permits of ration shops on this route should be collected. A proper planning for this should be done by the supply office. It should be ensured that the train runs at full capacity on a single route and all ration shops on that route are available to them. Care should be taken to ensure that the management of routes and ferries is done in the best interest of the transporter and ultimately of the government.
12.2 In order to save transportation cost, transportation to all Government godowns/ fair price shops in the district should be done from the nearest Food Corporation of India base depot. The district administration should get appointment from the Food Corporation of India for the concerned godown from the nearest base depot.
12.3 The Food Corporation of India is responsible for weighing the foodgrains received from the base depot.
