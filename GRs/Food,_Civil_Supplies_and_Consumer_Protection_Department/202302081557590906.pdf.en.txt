The Proposal:
The Government has decided to implement the" Decentralized Procurement Scheme" in the entire State as per the directions of the Central Government from both Kharif and Rabi Marketing Season 2016-17. The government has taken a decision. The scheme is being implemented across the state. Earlier, the rice produced by the Food Corporation of India (FCI) under the Minimum Support Price (MSP) procurement scheme was stored in the godowns under its control. However, from 2016-17, the rice produced under the decentralized procurement scheme is stored in the state government godowns and distributed under the targeted public distribution system. For the storage of CMR generated under the Minimum Support Price Procurement Scheme, the help of other departments of the government, corporations and central government corporations is required for this work. Central Warehousing Corporation is a Central Public Sector Undertaking (PSU) under the Government of India, which has constructed godowns at several places in the State for storage of foodgrains. Earlier, when procurement was being done through Food Corporation of India, the warehouses of Central Warehousing Corporation were being taken on rent.
However, considering this, the government was considering to take the warehouses of the Central Warehousing Corporation on a lease basis for storing rice or other grain stocks purchased from the state government. Following is the government's decision:
Government's decision:
The warehouses of the Central Warehousing Corporation should be taken on lease as per the prevailing terms and conditions of the Central Warehousing Corporation for the storage of paddy procured at various places in the State under the Centralized Procurement Scheme under the Minimum Support Price Procurement Scheme (CMR) during the marketing season 2022-23.
If the godowns of the Central Warehousing Corporation are taken on lease, then the government and the Central Warehousing Corporation should be informed by the concerned collector when the paddy/ CMR will not be stored in the respective godowns. Under no circumstances has the paddy/ CMR been hoarded

Government Decision Number: The concerned Collector should ensure that the rent for the period of Godown-2023/ P. No. 20/ NAPU-29 is not paid. If the rent is paid for the period of non-storage, the responsibility will be of the concerned collector.
