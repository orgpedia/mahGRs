Government Resolution, Department of Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Protection, No. 2017/ No. 149/ No. 22, dated 12th September, 2017.
Proposal: The Central Government. As per the letter dated 29th June, 2016, the process of procurement of foodgrains under the Minimum Support Price (MSP) procurement scheme in the State has been made online. Earlier, the Department of Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Protection had used the platform of NeML NCDEX Group of Companies for online procurement and distribution of sugar, tur dal and gram dal. Since all the work of procurement, distribution, etc. of the above-mentioned goods is being carried out smoothly during that month, on the same basis, the process of procuring paddy and collecting rice under the Base Price Purchase Scheme and the process of procuring and selling essential commodities from the central government/ open market during the future price rise will be approved by the policy of NeML NCDEX Group of Companies. The decision was taken at the Cabinet meeting held on July 5, 2017. Also, further action should be taken at the department level in accordance with this policy. It has been approved by the Cabinet.
In accordance with the above reference No. 1 is listed here. As per the Government decision dated 12.09.2017, the procurement of paddy under the Minimum Support Price (MSP) procurement scheme has been approved using the platform of NeML NCDEX Group of Companies. The Cabinet also approved the use of NeML's online platform for the procurement of wheat under the decentralized procurement scheme. The decision was taken on April 30, 2021.
On the same lines, it has been approved from time to time at the department level to use the platform of NeML NCDEX Group of Companies in the procurement process of coarse cereals (sorghum/ millet/ maize) along with the paddy procurement process from the 2016-17 season. However, the approval to use the online platform has been issued. The Government decision dated 12.09.2017 only mentions the use of NeML Online Platform for paddy procurement process under the" Decentralized Paddy Procurement" scheme. There is no mention of using an online platform to purchase millets. Therefore, it is not ruled out that in the future, there will be questions about the approval of NeML NCDEX Group of Companies to use the platform in the procurement process of millets. Therefore, a separate Government Resolution was under consideration to approve the use of the platform of NeML NCDEX Group of Companies for the procurement of coarse cereals (Jowar/ Bajra/ Maize/ Ragi) under the Minimum Support Price (MSP) procurement scheme.
