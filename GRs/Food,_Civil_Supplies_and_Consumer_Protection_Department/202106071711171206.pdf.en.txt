Read:- 1) Government Decision No.Savivya-1097/ P.No. 8038/ NAPU-28, Dy. 20.12.1997.
2) Government Resolution No. Sankirna- 1802/2692/ No. 723/ NAPU-28, D. 2.2.2002.

The Proposal:
In the state-level reforms under the Ease of Doing Business directed by the Central Government, Article No. 43 contains the subject" Grant of License for Fair Price Shops under relevant Act& its renewal." Accordingly, the proposal to allow ration shops and related matters online was under the consideration of the government. Accordingly, it is necessary to create a payment gateway to provide online services such as online acceptance of ration/ fair price shop approval applications, license fee, reserve amount, renewal fee and the process is underway.
Public Distribution System is implemented through authorized ration shops.
In the Mumbai rationing area, the shopkeepers pick up the ration directly from the government godown. In the rest of the state, the lifting of ration goods was from the Food Corporation of India to the government godown and from the government godown to the fair price shop. Authorization letters are issued to the authorized ration/ fair price shop owners for the sale of ration to the ration card holders. The authorized ration shopkeepers in the Mumbai-Thane ration shop area are to be issued an authorization letter under Regulation 10 (1) of the Maharashtra Foodgrains Allotment (Second) Regulations, 1966, and the shopkeepers in the rest of the state are to be issued an authorization letter under Rule 11 (1) of the Maharashtra Scheduled Commodities (Regulation of Distribution) Regulations, 1975, as per the prescribed pattern 7. Authorization fee, secondary authorization fee, reserve amount for authorized ration shops has been fixed in 1997 and renewal late fee in 2002. Now 20 years have passed since the imposition of this tax. There has been no increase in these various charges during this period. Now, considering the administrative cost of providing these services online, the government was considering increasing the fees for the above services.
GOVERNMENT DECISION: In view of the fact mentioned in the Preamble and the increase in expenditure in other essential aspects, the Central Government has issued directions for the Ease of Doing Business (EODB) Reforms under the District Level Business Reform Action Plan (DIBRAP), 2020, in respect of Fair Price Shops (FPSs), Reserves, Renovation Charges, Late Fee, etc. 20.12.1997, dt. 02.02.2002 and D. The increase in licence fee, reserve amount, renewal fee and late fee as per the Government decision dated 03.11.2007 is as follows:
