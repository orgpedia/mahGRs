Introduction- The Basic Price Purchase Scheme is a central government scheme for the benefit of farmers. Under this scheme, the Central Government announces the minimum support price for various crops and the paddy (FAQ paddy and coarse grains) is purchased by the state government so that the farmers do not have to sell the grain at a lower price than the guaranteed price (distress sale) to benefit from the support price. The Food Corporation of India (FCI) is the nodal agency for the central government in the state of Maharashtra. The paddy procured under the scheme is being procured from millers through agent agencies and the CMR (rice) is being deposited in the government godowns for distribution to the public distribution system by millers from the season 2016-17.
The Central Government has fixed the MSP for Kharif 2019-20 at Rs. 1815/- for A grade paddy and Rs. It is dated 1835. Farmers are in distress as the cost of production has gone up during the current season. Therefore, it is necessary to think sympathetically about giving the Paddy Procurement Incentive Support to these paddy farmers. However, as per the Central Government vide its letter dated 12th June, 2014, in case the State Government decides to provide bonus, the entire responsibility of implementing the Base Price Purchase Scheme shall be of the State Government and the Centre shall be responsible for implementation of the scheme.
