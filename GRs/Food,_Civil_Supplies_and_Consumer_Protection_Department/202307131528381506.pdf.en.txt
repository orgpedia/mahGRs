Ration shops are the link between the public distribution system and the beneficiaries and are the face of the public distribution system. In order to make the public distribution system more efficient, the government was considering to start the ration scheme at its doorstep for the distribution of food grains through mobile ration shop" Shidharath" due to the lack of space in the Mumbai-Thane ration shop area, the unaffordable rent of the ration shop space, the low response to run the ration shop, the difficulties in distributing food grains to the eligible beneficiaries under the National Food Security Scheme, 2013 in this area.
