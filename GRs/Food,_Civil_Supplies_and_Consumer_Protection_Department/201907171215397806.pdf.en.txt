The Proposal:
In pursuance of the recommendation received from the Public Accounts Committee in respect of the Audit Year 2012-2013, instructions have been issued from time to time under the relevant Government Circulars regarding the verification of eligibility of ration cards. There has been no change in the new norms. Therefore, in order to avoid confusion among the citizens in this regard, the following points are being clarified.
Government circular:
Under the targeted public distribution system in the state, permissible ration cards are issued to eligible families under the criteria set by the government. The government has not taken any decision to cancel the ration cards of the families of existing ration card holders who own two-wheelers and four-wheelers as well as land.
The ration cards issued to eligible families under the Public Distribution System under the criteria set by the government and the benefits received by the ration card holders accordingly will remain the same as before. Also, eligible families will continue to be given ration cards as per the criteria set by the government and the benefits received by the ration card holders accordingly. No change has been made in the criteria fixed for new ration cards under the Government decision dated 5.11.1999. As per the provisions of the Public Distribution System (Control) Order, 2001, ration card verification is a continuous process. Accordingly, the ration cards that do not meet the criteria should be immediately disqualified and cancelled and other permissible ration cards should be issued to them as per the demand of the concerned.
