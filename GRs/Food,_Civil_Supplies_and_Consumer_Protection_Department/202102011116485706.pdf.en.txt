Introduction: There is a huge prevalence of anaemia in the country and the state. According to the fourth National Family Health Survey 2015-16, 53.8% of children (age 6 months to 5 years), 38% of girls aged 10 to 18 years and 56% of pregnant women in Maharashtra have been found to be anaemic.
Anemia is caused by a deficiency of Vitamin A, B9/ folate and B12 in the diet.
It has been proved through research that if iron and other nutrients are given from food in sufficient quantity then anemia can be controlled to a great extent. At present the government is trying to control anemia by giving iron tablets etc. But it requires a different system.
The project of distribution of fortified rice through public distribution system in the state in the 2018-19 season with the help of Tata Trusts will be implemented on a pilot basis for 12 months in two talukas of Kurkheda and Bhamragad in Gadchiroli district. The decision was taken on June 1, 2018.
3. The Central Government has decided to implement the Centrally Sponsored Pilot Scheme of" Rice Fortification through Public Distribution System" in one district of the State. 2 is listed here. Approved by letter dated 14/02/2019. The scheme will be implemented in 15 districts of the state.

The post of Junior Project Manager is not permissible for implementing the scheme on a pilot basis. However, this position is permissible for those who carry out regular schemes.
6. Considering the above case-wise expenditure, for the scheme" Distribution of Fortified Rice through Public Distribution System," the estimated expenditure for rice fortification on account of State Government is Rs. 073/- per Kg. 25 per cent of the Rs. The estimated cost is Rs. 1 crore. The lower/ higher variation in the cost will depend on the actual rate at which the State receives the tender for procurement of FRK as well as the quantum of FRK.
Similarly, Rs. 48,60,000 is being approved.
Under this scheme, the central government has taken all the steps regarding the storage of FRK, storage of quality rice, packaging material, F+ logo to be printed on it and health instructions etc. as per the Operational& Technical guidelines issued on 25.7.2019.

However, if any discrepancy is found between the FRK provided and the FRK used as per the prescribed norms for fortification, the amount of difference shall be recovered from the concerned miller at the rate of one and half times of the purchase price of the FRK. Similarly, if there is a difference between the quantity of rice produced and the actual quantity of rice received from the government godown, the total amount of double the price of rice (CMR) plus the price of FRK for that year will be recovered in proportion to the difference. The action will be taken by the district-level committee.
