The committee will decide on it.
6.4 The Committee should also decide on the increase in procurement centres as per the requirement, taking into account the procurement made in the previous season.
(a) The method of purchase:
7.1 Each village should be linked to a particular shopping centre. Collectors and procurement agencies should ensure that adequate publicity is given about the procurement centres and the names of the villages attached to each procurement centre.
The area and village-wise list of farmers attached to the procurement centres should be obtained from the Talatha and recorded in the register at the procurement centre. If more than one village is connected to a single shopping centre, a separate village-wise register should be maintained at such a centre. This register should be made available to the district supply officer at the time of inspection of the procurement center.
Farmers can sell their produce anywhere in the district. Accordingly, the farmers registered for the sale of paddy at the paddy procurement center should be registered in the village-wise register at the purchase center. This register should be made available to the district supply officer at the time of inspection of the procurement center.
7.2 Online procurement system has been introduced for procurement of Paddy/ Coarse Cereals from farmers.
For this, the farmers need to be registered. For this, online registration, Aadhaar number and savings bank account number is being registered.

7.3. It is necessary to avoid crowding at procurement centres, maintain law and order as well as to give advance warning to farmers before they come to procurement centres in the backdrop of COVID-19. Under this scheme, farmers should be given advance notice through SMS on mobile (from NeML portal).
7.4 While procuring paddy from the farmers who have been given the right of lease over the forest land under the Forest Rights Act, 2005, a record of the area under the paddy/ coarse cereal crop in the said holding area, as well as the record regarding the 7/12 th partition, the necessary documents regarding the right of lease, etc.

7.7 It has been observed that in some places, paddy is procured on a very large scale (indirectly by traders) without considering the area under paddy and the average productivity. Therefore, paddy/ coarse grains should be procured by taking into account the area under the crop as per section 7/12 of the farmers, the cropping situation of this year (Paiswari) and the average production of the crop.
If it is found that paddy of traders/ brokers/ middlemen is being purchased at procurement centres, then the agent agencies should take strict action against such procurement centres and the concerned sub-agent agencies.

In this regard, the agent agencies should take care of registering all the concerned farmers by conducting a special campaign.
7.11 Considering the possibility of resale of last year's paddy/ coarse grains by the traders at the procurement centres, the agent agencies should take special care that last year's old paddy/ coarse grains are not purchased under any circumstances and only the new paddy/ coarse grains produced by the farmers are purchased. If paddy/ coarse grains are purchased from old or non-farmers, the entire responsibility will be on the agent agencies.
Storage of Coarse Cereals (Jowar, Bajra, Maize and Ragi) procured: 8.1 The Coarse Cereals (Jowar, Bajra, Maize and Ragi) procured as per the specifications by the agent agencies should be taken over by the representative of the State Government, preferably on the same day, in the godown near the centre, after weighing them completely and ensuring the quality, as decided by the Collector and the same should be recorded in the godown records regularly. If required, private godowns of Central and State Warehousing Corporations/ Cooperative Societies should be hired for storage.

In exceptional cases, where the expenditure is more than the said rates, the proposal should be submitted to this Department through the Administrative Department with due support from the Agent Institutions/ District Supply Officers.

In any case, the grain stock stored in the open will not get wet due to rain, and the grain bags will not get wet from below or from the side, and even if such stock remains in the open during the rainy season, the grain outside the warehouse should be arranged from the beginning. In this regard, a letter has been sent to the Government, Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Protection Department No. 1298/15/ PR No.
