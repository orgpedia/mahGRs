the prelude
There is a huge prevalence of anaemia in the country and the state. According to the fourth National Family Health Survey 2015-16, 53.8 per cent of children (age 6 months to 5 years) in Maharashtra, 48% of women aged 15 to 49 years, were found to be anaemic. Research has proved that anaemia can be controlled if iron and other nutrients are given from the diet in adequate quantity. At present, the government is trying to control anemia by giving iron tablets etc. Actions that complement this need to be taken.
