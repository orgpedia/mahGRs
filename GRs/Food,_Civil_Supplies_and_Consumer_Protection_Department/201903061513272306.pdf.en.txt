As per the amendment made by the Central Government in the commission of kerosene wholesale distributors, all the Collectors as well as the Controller Ration and the Director, Civil Supplies, Mumbai and all the Collectors should immediately issue a notification to the Government fixing the revised rate of kerosene after taking into account the prevailing ex-depot rate under the Public Distribution System, the Goods and Services Tax thereon, the revised commission of wholesale distributors, the prevailing transportation cost, the commission of semi-wholesalers, retailers' commission and other ancillary matters.
The Central Government while revising the commission of kerosene wholesale distributors has fixed separate commission for licensed distributors in Form 15 and for licensed distributors in other forms other than Form 15. So, in a single area, distributors who have a license in Form 15 and distributors who have a license in a form other than 15.

Government Resolution No: Rokel-2019/ No.46/ No.27,
If kerosene is being supplied, in order to avoid two different types of pricing of kerosene, all wholesale distributors will have to pay Rs. 1341.88 per kg. The rate should be fixed by assuming commission. However, the amount of difference in commission received by the licensed distributors in the form other than Form 15 in excess of the permissible commission is to be recovered from the concerned distributors and deposited with the government. Accordingly, all the collectors as well as the Controller Ration Allocation and Director, Civil Supplies, Mumbai should ensure that this amount is being deposited with the government.
