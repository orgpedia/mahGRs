Preamble: The process of digitization of eligible ration cards in the state is currently underway to include beneficiaries under the National Food Security Scheme. Thus, for digitization, the forms filled by the citizens for giving them ration cards for inclusion in the National Food Security Scheme are scrutinized based on the eligibility criteria. After this, the eligible ration cards will be digitized. Since it takes a lot of time to fill the forms and digitize the ration cards, the citizen who has filled the form, the citizen has to fill the form.
The citizen/ beneficiary is not aware that the ration card has been digitized and he is eligible to take direct benefit of receiving subsidized food grains.
