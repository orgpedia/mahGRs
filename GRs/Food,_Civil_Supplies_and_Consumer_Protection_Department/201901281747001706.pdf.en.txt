4.2 The bidders shall pay the same rate in percentage for all stages without different rates for the stage-wise base rates of distance travelled in paragraph 4.1 above.
4.2.1 Single distance between the dispatch warehouse and the receiving warehouse should be considered for the consideration of any transportation charges. Even if there is a change in the location of the base warehouse due to any reason, the single distance between the new base warehouse to the receiving warehouse should be considered for consideration of payments.
4.2.2 In respect of the total shortfall during transportation, the shortfall shall be recovered as per the rates fixed in the Government Decision on procurement of foodgrains for that year, subject to acceptance of the shortfall as per the directions issued for the Central Government's Decentralized Procurement Scheme.
4.2.3 The payment of carriage charges for the decentralized procurement scheme should be processed as per the prevailing procedure.
Section No. 4 (4.4) 4.4 The re-tendering process shall be carried out in cases where bids of 20% or less than the base price shall not be accepted.
instead of
4.4 Bids will be accepted at rates lower than the base price but the bidder will be required to submit a justification as to how the bidder can afford to work at lower rates.
Section No. (4.6) 4.6 In the event of the Food Corporation of India's inability to make the allocation available from the prescribed base depot on account of unavoidable reasons, the additional cost of such transportation should be approved as follows, in case the transportation has to be made from the alternate depot. The higher percentage of transportation charges shall be provided for the distance covered as compared to the average distance covered for that phase at the time of tendering. Under no circumstances should the payments of the transporter be kept pending for this reason. The additional expenditure in this regard will be borne by the Food Corporation of India.
For example:- Assuming the average distance between the base depot of the Food Corporation of India and the concerned government warehouse to be 65 km, Rs. The base rate has been fixed at 50.88 per cent. If the transportation is beyond 100 km due to unavoidable reasons, the payment of transportation will be considered as follows.

While publishing the tender for this, the District Supply Office should determine the average distance between the base depot of the district and the government godowns and accordingly consider the above.
instead of
4.6 In case of unavoidable circumstances, if the allocation is made from a base depot other than the regular base depot and therefore the transportation is carried for a distance more than the average distance of the district, the rates of additional transportation should be calculated as per the approved rates of inter-district transportation.
