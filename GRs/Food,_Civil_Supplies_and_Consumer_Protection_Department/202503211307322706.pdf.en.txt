Preamble The implementation of Centrally Sponsored Schemes through SNA-SPARSH for effective disbursement of funds for Centrally Sponsored Schemes has been communicated by the Central Government under the letter No. 1 referred to. The Department's National Food Security Scheme (MH-40% Revision of norms for Central Assistance Released to States / UTs for meeting expenditure on intra-state movement handling of food and FPS dealers) has been incorporated for implementation through SNA-SPARSH, as per the Government of India Resolution No. 2. Also, in line with the implementation of Centrally Sponsored Schemes under SNA SPARSH, the concerned department of the state government has notified that it is mandatory to open a State Linked Schemes SLS-wise separate Drawing Account at Rees Bank of India.
The Department of Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Protection, vide Reference No. 4, has authorised the opening of Single Nodal Account by declaring the Joint Secretary / Deputy Secretary (Blue-22) as the Nodal Officer and the Financial Advisor / Deputy Secretary as the Single Nodal Agency (SNA-SPARSH). Accordingly, a Single Nodal Account for the National Food Security Scheme has been opened with the Reserve Bank of India in the name of Financial Adviser B. Deputy Secretary.
With the operationalization of the SNA-SPARSH system, funds were being drawn for the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of National Food Security Scheme under three headings: Central Share 50 (Heading 4408 0424), State Share 50 (Heading 4408 0433) and Additional State Share above 50 (Heading 4408 0442). Funds for the scheme will now be disbursed through the SNA-SPARSH system in this financial year 2024-25. The SNA-SPARSH system consists only of the central share and the state share.
Facility is available for disbursement of funds from the headings of accounts. Since the separate accounting title facility for spending from the additional state share (top-up) is not currently developed in the SNA-SPARSH system,
The Joint Director, Directorate of IT, Accounts and Accounts, said that action should be taken to release the government decision by dividing the required grant of Top-Up Scheme into state share headings so that the amount of Top-Up is currently recorded in the state accounts for providing from SNA-SPARSH.
