In paragraph 5 of the said Government Resolution, in Annexure B and Annexure C, the office-wise number of posts of Assistant Controller has been fixed and separate posts have been earmarked for Assistant Controller.

The total number of posts of Assistant Controller and Inspector separately indicated in Annexure B and Annexure C to the Government Decision dated 14.10.2022 are being sanctioned for the cadre of Assistant Controller/ Inspector. The post will be held by an officer of either cadre of' Assistant Controller" or' Inspector."
