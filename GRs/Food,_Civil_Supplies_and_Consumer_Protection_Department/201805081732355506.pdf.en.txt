Regarding the calculation of inflation index to the Hamal workers. The guidelines have been issued vide Government Circular dated 6th July, 2017.
Similarly, in many districts, it has come to the notice of the government that the pawnbrokers are getting lower rates than the base rates announced by the Mathadi Board as per the provisions of the Mathadi Act. As per the provisions of the Mathadi Act, it is mandatory for the Hamali workers to get the Hamali as per the rates declared by the Mathadi Board in the district.
In view of the above fact, the porter workers will get the porter rate announced by the Mathadi Board of the district, as well as the increase in the levy and inflation index in a timely manner
Since there is no need to implement the procedure of hiring workers from Mathadi Board in the district, the government has canceled the decision taken to implement this procedure in the above 7 districts.
Reference No. 5 As per the decision of the Department of Industry, Energy and Labor, no board should register new workers only for wind power. as well as filling and unloading
Since it has been clarified that the work itself includes work in the form of winding, there is a need to make changes in the work aspects. Inflation in some districts
Complaints have been received with the government about the non-receipt of the amount received as per the index increase to the porters and the non-payment of the levy thereon to the Mathadi Board.
In view of the above, it was under consideration of the Government to issue a fresh Government Resolution regarding fixing of Hamal Contract for handling foodgrains in Government godowns for the next period.
Government's decision:
The government has decided to fix a new porter contract for handling foodgrains, sugar, tur, millets and other items in government godowns in the state as per the following terms and conditions.
(9) The districts in which the present situation exists as per the Government Decision dated 12th September, 2014
The state government has decided to cancel all the existing contracts of foodgrains handling and tender process for fresh contracts in seven districts of the state including Sangli, Beed, Wardha, Nanded, Osmanabad, Washim and Ratnagiri.

(2) Reference No. Department of Industry, Energy and Labour. According to the government decision dated September 6, 2016, no board should register new workers just for the sake of work.
It is also clarified that the work of filling and unloading involves only the work of winding and in the government godowns only the work of the porter is done.
Since the team is not working, no separate allotment will be given.
Accordingly, it may be noted that the change in the nature of work has been made and the work which was earlier running under C (2) (1) will now run as A (one) and the work which was earlier running under B (5) will now run as B (two). (For details of the work, see Annexure No. 10 Please see. (3) The rates for handling of foodgrains in Government godowns shall be per quintal. (Where the rates of 50 kg gunny bags/ per tonne/ per 100 bags have been fixed earlier, the rates of two gunny bags of 50 kg should be clubbed together) The Collector should bring these issues to the notice of all the bidders and ensure that competitive rates in the tender are sought at the rate of per quintal while executing the tender process.
(4) Base Rates of Hamali Work: The rates of Hamali fixed/ applied for the current year by the Mathadi Board concerned in the district shall be considered as the base rates for tendering process. For this, a letter should be written to the Mathadi Board related to the district and it should be obligated to pay the rates within 30 days. The Collector will be fully responsible for obtaining the above rates. The Mathadi Board should take into account that while announcing the rates, they will not be less than the minimum wage.
The District Mathadi Boards are empowered to fix the basic rates and other service conditions of the Hamali as per the legal provisions of the scheme applicable to them. Considering the fact that the department has prescribed new work items by including winding work in the maintenance work items, the concerned Mathadi Board should fix the base rate.
As above, for the works prescribed by the Mathadi Board of the district, the subject-wise base rate of Hamali fixed for the current year and the actual rate of Hamali workers in the district, whichever rate is higher, will be considered as the base rate of Hamali for this tender process. This will be the base rate paid to the workers. Affluent workers cannot claim competitive rates over the base rates paid to the institutions.
