Read: 1) Government Resolution No: Purchase-1014/ PR No.17/ NAPU-29, dated 14.01.2016 2) Government Resolution No: Purchase 1019/ PR No. No.98/ NAPU-29, dated 09.09.2019 3) Govt. 115/ NAPU 29, dated 08.11.2019 Preamble- The Government has decided to implement the Decentralized Procurement Scheme (DPS) in the entire State as per the directions of the Central Government from both Kharif and Rabi Marketing Season 2016-17. The government has taken a decision. The scheme is being implemented across the state. Earlier, the rice produced by the Food Corporation of India (FCI) under the Minimum Support Price (MSP) procurement scheme was stored in the godowns under its control. However, from 2016-17, the rice produced under the decentralized procurement scheme is to be deposited in the state government godowns and distributed under the targeted public distribution system. Since the Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Protection Department does not have adequate storage systems, it is necessary to take the help of other government departments and corporations for this work. The Maharashtra State Warehousing Corporation is a public sector enterprise under the Department of Cooperation, Marketing and Textiles, Government of Maharashtra.
Earlier, the Maharashtra State Warehousing Corporation (MSWMC) used to take the godowns on rent while the procurement was done through the Food Corporation of India (FCI). However, considering the above, the Government of Maharashtra may consider the procurement of rice or other foodgrains by the State Government at the rate lower than that of Food Corporation of India and Maharashtra State Fertilizers Corporation and at the rate lower than that of Agriculture Produce Market Committee and Food Corporation of India.

After verifying this, they should submit a reservation proposal for the available warehouse.
2. The agencies shall be fully responsible for insurance, pest control measures, security, maintenance of logs of arrivals and departures, etc. of the leased warehouses.
(a) Before hiring the godowns of the Agricultural Produce Market Committees, a certificate regarding the condition and the rent payable should be obtained from the Public Works Department. The contract should be signed at the rate which is lower than the Public Works Department rate or the Provisional Cost Sheet.
