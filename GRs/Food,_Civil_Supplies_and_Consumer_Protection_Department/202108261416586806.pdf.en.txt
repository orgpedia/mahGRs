Semi wholesale license, Reference No. 6 The modalities for renewal of Wholesale/ Hawkers/ Retail Kerosene Licenses have been decided as per the decision of the Government. After the death of a kerosene license holder in the state, his license is transferred in the name of his heir. Reference No. 2 The procedure has been determined in accordance with the Government Decision herein and Reference No. 8 This procedure has been partially amended by the circular here.
Also Reference No. Under the decision of the government here, the definition of the family of the license holder has been fixed for the transfer of kerosene licenses/ fair price shop licenses in the name of the heir.
In some exceptional cases, the Government is requested to transfer the kerosene license and fair price shop license in the name of other heirs if the heirs as determined under the said Government decision are not available. However, from a humanitarian point of view, even though it is necessary to transfer the license in the name of other heirs not included in the definition, the absence of such a provision in the governing decision does not make it possible to transfer the license in the name of the heir. Accordingly, it was under consideration of the Government to amend the definition of family which was fixed for transfer of retail/ hawkers/ semi-wholesale kerosene license holders and fair price shop license holders after their death to their next of kin.
Further, the Government was contemplating to issue a comprehensive Government decision providing for the procedures to be followed in granting, renewing and transferring Kerosene licences, attesting the names of the heirs on the licence, transferring the licences in the name of the heirs as well as in determining the heirs so as to bring clarity, uniformity and uniformity in the proceedings by superseding the various Government decisions issued from time to time.
Government's decision:
As mentioned in the above reference no. 7 decision of the government. Except for 06.07.2017, all other relevant Government decisions are being superseded. Further, the procedure for grant of retail kerosene licences, renewal of wholesale/ semi-wholesale/ hawkers/ retail licences and transfer of semi-wholesale/ hawkers/ retail licences in favour of the heirs is being prescribed as under:
