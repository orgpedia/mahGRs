Introduction: Minimum Support Price Purchase Scheme is a Central Government scheme, which is implemented so that farmers do not have to sell food grains at a lower price than the guaranteed price. For this purpose, the Maharashtra State Co-op (in the non-tribal sector) will be formed through the agent agencies appointed by the state government. Marketing Federation, Mumbai and in tribal areas, Maharashtra State Cooperative Tribal Development Corporation, Nashik) procures paddy and millets of FAQ (Fair Average Quality) in the state.

Considering the recommendation of the Central Government regarding the implementation of the" Decentralized Procurement Scheme" (DCPS) in the State for the procurement of" Paddy," the State Government has decided to implement the Decentralized Procurement Scheme in the entire State from the 2016-17 season. Therefore, the CMR generated in this scheme is being deposited in the warehouses designated by the state government. Accordingly, the matter of issuance of instructions for procurement of paddy/ coarse grains in 2018-19 season was under consideration of the Government.
Government's decision:
The Government of India has notified the Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) for paddy, jowar, bajra and maize under the Minimum Support Price (MSP) procurement Scheme for 2018-19 season. Besides, the Centre has instructed to open control rooms at the state level to ensure that farmers get the benefit of the base price and they do not have to sell their food grains at a lower price than the guaranteed price. Accordingly, in order to ensure that the farmers of the state get the benefit of the minimum support price, the following orders are being issued for the purchase of paddy and millet, millet and maize in the state:

However, in most of the cases, correspondence is received from the Central Government to the State Government as the Agricultural Produce Market Committees do not provide specific information about the FAQ/ Non-FAQ status while informing/ reporting the respective procurement prices. Therefore, any market committee while publishing or informing the prices of paddy and coarse grains purchased in their area through any medium, should also mention the FAQ and non-FAQ status along with the rate of purchase and sale.

# Page 8
Government Resolution No: Purchase- 1018/ P.No. 185/ N.P. 29
All District Collectors should give instructions to the Agricultural Produce Market Committees in their areas.
(e) The State Government, in consultation with the Central Government, shall separately decide the cost to be borne by the Maharashtra State Cooperative Marketing Federation, Mumbai and the Tribal Development Corporation, Nashik, for the purchase of sorghum, millet, maize and paddy under the Base Price Scheme.
(a) The deficit/ shortfall in the procurement of coarse cereals and paddy under the above scheme shall be admissible only if the Central Government approves it.
The shopping centres:
As directed by the District Collector, the procurement agencies should open procurement centres for the purchase of paddy, jowar, bajra and maize at the required places. A total of 695 procurement centres were approved for opening during 2017-18. Out of these, 437 have reached the procurement centres.
As a result, 258 such centres were not functional, but equipment and manpower had to be supplied there. Considering this, the concerned collector should ensure that the necessary shopping centers are not opened.
7) Procurement System: Each village should be linked to a particular procurement centre. If the farmer of the village takes paddy/ coarse grains to another procurement center, then he should not buy his paddy/ coarse grains at that center. Collectors and procurement agencies should take care to give adequate publicity about the procurement centres and the names of the villages attached to each procurement centre. Online procurement system has been started while purchasing paddy/ coarse grains from farmers. For this, the farmers need to be registered. For this, online registration, Aadhaar number and savings bank account number is being registered.
It is mandatory to register on the platform of NeML NCDEX Group Company for the 2018-19 season and register it in PFMS (Public Fund Monitoring System) as per the instructions of the Central Government.
Paddy/ Coarse Cereals should be purchased only after seeing the 7/12 ratio of the land owned by the farmers. It should be ensured that the area under sorghum and other cereals/ paddy is recorded in the said chart. Note 7/12 on the back of the receipt. 7/12 should not be returned to the farmer.
In respect of paddy/ millets brought by farmers for sale at procurement centres
Page 32 of 8.
# Page 9
Government Resolution No: Purchase- 1018/ P.No. 185/ N.P. 29
Online registration and village-wise registration should be done. It should include 1) Name of the farmer, 2) Survey/ Group Number and Area, 3) Paddy/ Jowar, Millet and Maize brought for sale at the centre. So, once the grain is brought back, the earlier 7/12 can be extracted from this register to ensure that the farmer's grain is of his own production. Before accepting the paddy/ coarse grains brought by truck or similar vehicle, it should be fully ensured that the paddy/ coarse grains belong to the real farmer.
It has been observed that in some places, paddy is procured on a very large scale (indirectly by traders) without considering the area under paddy and the average productivity. Therefore, paddy/ coarse grains should be procured by taking into account the area under the crop as per section 7/12 of the farmers, the cropping situation of this year (Paiswari) and the average production of the crop. Every evening after the closure of the procurement center, the responsibility of handling the paddy/ coarse grains brought to the procurement center, but not purchased, will be the responsibility of the concerned farmer. Considering the possibility of resale of last year's paddy/ coarse grains by the traders at the procurement centres, the agent agencies should take special care that last year's old paddy/ coarse grains are not purchased under any circumstances and only the new paddy/ coarse grains produced by the farmers are purchased. If paddy/ coarse grains are purchased from old or non-farmers, the entire responsibility will be on the agent agencies.
Storage of procured coarse grains (Jowar, Bajra and Maize): (a) The coarse grains procured as per the specifications by the agent agencies, namely, Jowar, Bajra and Maize, shall be taken over by the representative of the State Government, preferably on the same day, in the godown near the centre, after weighing them completely and ascertaining the quality, as decided by the Collector and shall be recorded in the godown records regularly. If required, private godowns of Warehousing Corporation/ Co-operative Societies should be taken on rent for storage. If the need arises to store the stock in the open, before storing it, arrangements should be made to provide drainage under and around the husks of such food grains and to cover them completely with sufficient palm leaves. Also, the paddy should be protected from pests by timely pivoting by a regular contractor as per the need. In any case, the grain stock stored in the open will not get wet due to rain and the grain bags will not get wet from below or from the side and even if such stock remains in the open during the rainy season, the grain will be damaged.

# Page 10
Government Resolution No: Purchase- 1018/ P.No. 185/ N.P. 29
The security of the grain outside the godown should be arranged from the beginning itself taking care that it does not happen. In this regard, a letter has been sent to the Government, Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Protection Department No. 1298/15/ PR No. 2579/ No. The Code prescribed under Section 29, dated 3rd August, 1998 (Annexure VII) should be scrupulously followed.

Paddy should not be seized by the district collector.
The agent agencies should appoint millers in the prescribed manner and collect the paddy as per the terms and conditions of the central government and deposit the produced rice in the government godown of the district collector. The specifications, storage size, transportation cost and other terms and conditions as may be decided by the Central Government shall continue to apply. Detailed instructions regarding paddy procurement will be issued separately.
b) Rs. The warehouse rent rate of Rs 2.40 per quintal has been approved. It will be the responsibility of the agent agencies to start paddy ploughing immediately in any situation. In any case, it should be ensured that the paddy does not remain in the godown for more than two months.
