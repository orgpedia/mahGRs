The committees should strictly implement it and ensure that wheat of FAQ quality is not purchased at less than the guaranteed price.
The Publicity:
To ensure that farmers are aware of these prices, billboards should be put up on the front side of the Gram Panchayat, Tehsil Office, Block Development Officer's Office, etc. Also, the agencies and district collectors concerned should use local newspapers, cloth boards, etc. to give proper publicity to such information.
7.2. Procurement Agents shall take care of drying and cleaning of wheat at the procurement centre and to ensure that the basic facilities required for smooth procurement process are provided at the procurement centre.
The shopping centres:
8.1 Procurement centres should be opened keeping in view the convenience of the farmers as well as the arrival of wheat, the need for procurement centres, etc. As directed by the District Coordination Committee, the procurement agencies should open procurement centers for the purchase of wheat at the required places.
8.2 Wheat to be procured at each procurement centre should be as per the specified specifications.
But if a farmer brings wheat of less quality as per the specification despite giving publicity, then he should buy wheat only after getting the copy of the said grain as per the specification/ revised.

8.6 The District Supply Officers shall ensure that the gunny bags filled with wheat are in the prescribed quantity or not. Wherever possible, the District Supply Officer and the representative of the procurement agent should jointly inspect the supply of gunny bags. If the test shows low levels of mercury, it should be rejected. It should be ensured that no complaint will come to the government about the use of low-quality gunny bags.
8.7 Only 50 kg bardana should be used for wheat.
Procurement System: Each village should be connected to a particular procurement centre. If a farmer goes to another procurement centre, he should not buy wheat from that centre. The Collector and the Procurement Agent should take care to give adequate publicity about the procurement centres and the names of the villages attached to each procurement centre. Farmers will have to register themselves for online purchase of wheat. For this, online registration, Aadhaar number and savings bank account number will have to be registered. This purchase has to be registered on the platform of NeML NCDEX Group Company. As per the guidelines of the Central Government, it is mandatory to register online in PFMS (Public Fund Monitoring System). Wheat should be purchased only after seeing the 7/12 ratio of the land owned by the farmers. Make sure that the area under the wheat is recorded in this passage. Note 7/12 on the back of the receipt. 7/12 should not be returned to the farmer. Village-wise register should be prepared in accordance with the wheat brought by the farmers for sale at the purchase center. These include 1) Name of the farmer, 2) Survey/ group number and area, 3) Selling at the centre.
The information about the wheat brought should be included. So, once the wheat is brought back, by extracting the earlier 7/12 from this register, the farmers can ensure that the wheat brought is of their own production. Before accepting wheat brought by truck or similar vehicle, it should be fully ensured that the grain belongs to the same farmer. It has been observed that in some places, paddy is procured on a very large scale (indirectly by traders) without considering the area under paddy and the average productivity. Therefore, wheat should be purchased by taking into account the area under the crop as per section 7/12 of the farmers, the cropping situation (payawari) this year, and the average production of the crop. The District Supply Officer should obtain the district-wise production of wheat from the District Superintending Agriculture Officer of his respective district and report it to both the agent agencies. Both the agent agencies should ensure that the wheat is purchased on the basis of this production.

Every day after the closure of the procurement center in the evening, the responsibility of handling the wheat brought to the procurement center, but not purchased, will be the responsibility of the concerned farmer. Considering the possibility of last year's old wheat being re-sold by the traders at the purchase center, the agents should take special care that last year's old wheat will not be purchased under any circumstances and only the new wheat produced by the farmers will be purchased. If wheat is purchased from old and non-farmers, then the full responsibility of it will be on the agent.
10) Storage of procured wheat:
10.1 The procured wheat should be stored by the agent agencies in their own godowns. Both the agencies will be responsible till the wheat is handed over to the District Supply Officer. The concerned Collector will be responsible for storage, storage, transportation/ mobilization etc. of such paddy after the quality inspection and weighing is submitted by the wheat agent agencies to the concerned District Supply Officer. The records in this regard should be taken regularly in the warehouse account by the office of the District Supply Officer. If the need arises to store the grain in the open, before storing it, arrangements should be made to provide drainage under and around the bag of such grain and to cover it completely with sufficient palm leaves. Also, the paddy should be protected from pests by timely pivoting by a regular contractor as per the need. In any case, the grain stock stored in the open will not get wet due to rain, and the grain bags will not get wet from below or from the side, and even if such stock remains in the open during the rainy season, the grain will not be spoiled. In this regard, the Government letter in Annexure' B," Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Protection Department No. The Code prescribed under Section 129/15/ PR No. 2579/ N.P. 29, dated 3rd August, 1998 should be scrupulously followed.
10.2 The Collector/ District Supply Officer shall physically verify that the wheat is of FAQ quality while taking possession of it. Also, the certificate should be sent to the Food Corporation of India.
10.3 The details of the wheat stored in the godown should be submitted to the Government within one week after the expiry of the wheat procurement period. A copy of the FAQ certificate should also be submitted.
10.4 Wheat procured under Minimum Support Price Procurement Scheme was being disposed of by Food Corporation of India. However, since the decentralized procurement scheme is being implemented in the state from the Rabi Marketing Season 2020-21, the disposal of the said wheat is expected to be at the level of the state government. Accordingly, orders for taking appropriate action in respect of wheat procured by the State Government will be issued separately.
