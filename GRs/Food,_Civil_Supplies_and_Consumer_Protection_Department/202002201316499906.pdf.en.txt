Preamble: The Government has decided to implement the Decentralized Procurement Scheme in the entire State as per the directions of the Central Government from both Kharif and Rabi Marketing Season 2016-17. The government has taken a decision. The scheme is being implemented across the state. Earlier, the rice produced by the Food Corporation of India (FCI) under the Minimum Support Price (MSP) procurement scheme was stored in the godowns under its control. However, from 2016-17, the rice produced under the decentralized procurement scheme is to be deposited in the state government godowns and distributed under the targeted public distribution system. Since the Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Protection Department does not have adequate storage systems, it is necessary to take the help of other government departments, corporations and central government corporations for this work. Central Warehousing Corporation is a Central Public Sector Undertaking (PSU) under the Government of India, which has constructed godowns at several places in the State for storage of foodgrains. Earlier, when procurement was being done through Food Corporation of India, the warehouses of Central Warehousing Corporation were being taken on rent. However, considering this, the government was considering to take the warehouses of the Central Warehousing Corporation on a lease basis for storing rice or other grain stocks purchased from the state government. Following is the government's decision:
