No.171/ NAPU-16A, Dy. January 16, 2018 (5) Government Decision No. 26th February 2021.
The Proposal:
After certifying the bags of foodgrains in the government grain godowns where electricity is available in the state, bag sewing machines are used to sew them and twine knots are used in the government grain godowns where electricity is not available.
The central government has made a big change in the procurement process under the National Procurement Policy.
Government e-Marketplace (GeM) is a portal developed by Government of India for procurement of goods and services by Government Departments/ Organizations. The modalities of this portal have been approved by the State Government for procurement of goods and services in terms of Department of Industries, Power and Labour vide Reference No. The decision has been approved by the government. Accordingly, if there are two or more suppliers of goods and services available for purchase on the Government e-Marketplace (GeM) portal, then the Government e-Marketplace (GeM) portal will be used for purchase of such goods and services. The targeted departments/ offices mentioned in paragraph 2.4 dated 1st December, 2016 have been made mandatory. Also read about the process. 1 here. Necessary changes have been made in the Government Decision dated 1st December, 2016.

Government Resolution No: Material-3120/ No.67/ No.16A
Accordingly, read Section No. 4 For 550 government grain godowns where electricity is available, 1100 sewing machines, a set of their spare parts, hanging hooks and thread for sewing machines have been procured through the Government e-Marketplace (GeM) portal and supplied to the field offices.
Sufficient yarn was made available for one year for the above sewing machines.
The departmental store purchase committee held a meeting to make available the yarn for sewing machines made available as above. It was held on July 3, 2020. In the meeting, the department issued reference No. 5 was approved by the government. However, the financial year 2020-21 has come to an end. Even if the tender process for the purchase of yarn for the bag sewing machine is started on the GeM portal, the actual delivery would have taken place in the new financial year 2021-22. Considering these factors, it was necessary to revise the allocation of funds and governance, as well as to determine the purchase price accordingly, taking into account the current year's updated prices of yarn on the GeM portal. Similarly, out of a total of 32 districts which had provided potty sewing machines earlier, it would not be possible to provide thread to those districts where potty sewing machines have now become defunct. Hence, the process could not be completed.
Instructions were given to inform the demand for yarn from the 32 districts to which the potty sewing machines have been provided. Of these, only 20 districts had submitted their demand for paddy and the matter was under the consideration of the government to implement the procurement process.
Read as follows. 5 here. The revised order is being issued by superseding the government decision dated 26 February 2021 as follows.
Government's decision:
After the certification of the bags of food grains in the government grain godowns where electricity is available in the state, the bags have been purchased for sewing. Also, as per the fresh demand of the District Supply Officers of 18 districts, a total of 445 bags of sewing machines are proposed to be purchased in the government grain warehouses where electricity is available in the state.
Accordingly, for the sewing machines in the districts mentioned in Annexure-A annexed to this Government Decision, a total of 3, 17,602 reels of Polypropylene multi-filament thread (as mentioned in Column 3 and Column 4 of Annexure-A) are to be procured for the next one year through competitive online bidding process on Government e-Marketplace (GeM) (BOQ mode) on Central Government Portal through BOQ mode and GeM for the same.
