Introduction: The Centrally Sponsored Minimum Support Price (MSP) procurement scheme is implemented by the State Governments on behalf of Food Corporation of India (FCI). The main objective of the scheme is to provide remunerative prices to farmers for their produce. The" Decentralized Procurement Scheme" is being implemented in the entire State from 2016-17 season under which paddy and coarse grains are procured in non-tribal areas through Marketing Federation, Mumbai and in tribal areas through Tribal Development Corporation, Nashik. Instead of depositing the CMR with the Food Corporation of India (FCI), the paddy procured by these agencies is deposited in the government godowns through the respective millers. As per the agreement between the State Government, Central Government and Food Corporation of India, the primary responsibility of distribution of CMR and coarse cereals under the Minimum Support Price Purchase Scheme to the beneficiaries under the National Food Security Scheme lies with the State Government. The Central Government has fixed the transportation rate of paddy and CMR. As per the guidelines issued vide letter dated 06.05.2019, the State Level Committee has been instructed to recommend to the Central Government to approve the transport rates obtained after the tender process at the district level based on the SOR (Schedule of Rates) of transport fixed by the State Level Committee under the Provisional Cost Sheet. Accordingly, the State Level Committee for the season 2021-22 has been constituted. The transport rates recommended by the District Collectors in view of the tenders floated at the district level based on the SoRs approved in the meeting held on 25.11.2021 have been approved by the State Level Committee. This has been approved in the meeting dated 07.06.2022.
Now, the procurement under season 2021-22 was 183.21 lakh quintal of paddy and the procurement of 122.75 lakh quintal of CAMAR was under the consideration of the Government for fixing the transportation charges for making available under the National Food Security Scheme.
