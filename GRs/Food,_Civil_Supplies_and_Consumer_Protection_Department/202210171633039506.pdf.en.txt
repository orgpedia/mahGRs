5. FRK for fortification of common coarse rice (CMR) and Rs. 73/- and other incidental expenses (para. As mentioned in Table 4) 100% reimbursement will be from the Central Government. However, the state government will have to bear the cost. Accordingly, the expenditure for the said two phases of rice fortification and other aspects is being approved.
5.1 Under the scheme, fortified rice is to be distributed under the Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS). Since the said scheme is part of the National Food Security Scheme, the expenditure under the said scheme should be first met by the State Government from the provision under the head' Supplementary Expenditure Available for the National Food Security Scheme of this Department for the financial year 2022-23 and 2023-24 respectively, head account head 4408 0326 (Mandatory), 50-Other Expenditure for Mumbai City and head account head for mofussil area head head head head- 44080335 (Mandatory), 50-Other Expenditure).

Government Resolution No: Parichay-2621/ P.No.303/ NAPU-29
The lower/ higher variation in the cost will depend on the actual rate at which the State receives the tender as well as the quantum of FRK.
(b) At the time of paddy ploughing, the millers concerned are required to mix the grains of FRK in the quantity of 1 FRK: 100 CMR grains in the common rice (CMR).

(e) Under this scheme, the Central Government will take all steps for the procurement of FRK for the production of nutritious quality rice, selection of millers, quality inspection, storage, packaging material, F+ logo to be printed on it and health and quality instructions, etc. Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Quality Management Protocols for Fortified Rice Kernels (FRK) and Fortified Rice (FR)-reg. to be done accordingly.
(e) Since the process requires fortification of CMR received from the procurement of paddy procured under the decentralized paddy procurement scheme, the process of procurement and procurement of paddy shall be as per the provisions of the Government Resolution to be issued by the Government for that season.
Under the Decentralized Procurement Scheme, the paddy procured by the agent agency from the millers will be mixed with FRK and the fortified rice received after fortification will be the responsibility of the concerned agent organization and the concerned millers until it is deposited in the government warehouse under the control of the concerned district supply officer as per the prescribed standards of the central government.
