The Proposal:
Under the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Minimum Support Price (MSP) procurement, a Decentralized Procurement Plan (DCP) is being implemented in the State from 2016-17 season.
Central Government Referred No. The bardana must be used as directed by letter 2. As per the guidelines, for 1 quintal of CMR, 2 new and 2 single-use gunny bags are required for a limited quantity of 37.50 kg of 1.49 quintal of paddy. The policy on procurement of Bardana available on the web portal of the Central Government https:// dfpd. gov. in has been finalised. Accordingly, for procurement of new bardana for Kharif Marketing Season 2020-21, bardana was procured by depositing advance amount with Jute Commissioner, Kolkata but bardana seed could not be made available by them in time. Therefore, some new bardana was made available by determining the supplier through a tender at the national level. As per the Reference letter 3 sent by the Central Government for Kharif Marketing Season 2021-22, it has been pointed out that the bardana supplied through Jute Commissioner, Kolkata may not be available as per the demand. Therefore, it was under the consideration of the government to make the bardana available through an open tender for the timely procurement of paddy and CMR.
Reference No. 1 of the revised Rules of Procedure for procurement of offices to be carried out by Government Departments vide Rule No. Under 2.9.2, the government was considering the formation of a state-level administrative department purchase committee for the purchase of gunny bags and administrative approval for the purchase of new and old gunny bags.
Government Decision: In view of the objective of procurement of paddy and coarse grains given by the Central Government for the Kharif and Rabi Marketing Season 2021-22 under the Centrally Sponsored Minimum Support Scheme, the State Level Administrative Procurement Committee is being constituted as follows for making available new and old jute bags required for the same.
