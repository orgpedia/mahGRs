The Hon'ble Minister (Finance), State of Maharashtra in his Budget Speech for the year 2019-20 has announced" Chul Mukt Dhoom Mukt Maharashtra." The announcement made by him in his speech is as follows:" A major campaign in the form of Ujjwala Yojana is being run in the country to enable the Indian woman to live in a smoke-free environment. It has benefited the people of the country. The government intends to provide gas connections to families who have been deprived of the benefits of Ujjwala Gas Yojana, Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Jan-Van Vikas Yojana and other schemes of LPG gas distribution in Maharashtra. The scheme is planned to be completed in the next financial year by paying tribute to the mother power of the state. The scheme will be implemented as a pilot project in farmer suicide affected districts, Naxal affected districts and aspirational districts. An outlay of Rs.100 crore is being earmarked for this purpose in the financial year 2019-20 and funds will be made available as per requirement. " Ma. In line with the above announcement of the Minister (Finance), State of Maharashtra, the Government was considering to implement a scheme for distribution of gas connections to non-gas connection holders in all districts of the State by giving priority to farmer suicide affected districts, Naxal affected districts and aspirational districts.
Government Decision:- The Central Government's Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana and the expanded Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana-2 are working on a war footing to identify and provide gas connections to eligible families in Maharashtra. In Maharashtra, under Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana and Extended Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana-II, 40.63 lakh households have been provided with gas connections till April, 2019. However, some families are still deprived of the benefit of gas connection. All eligible families will be identified under the Central Government's Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana and the extended Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana.

2) The gas connection will be sanctioned in the name of the adult woman who is the head of the family.
3) One ration card holder family will be eligible for a single gas connection.

This information was given by the district collector. The collector will send the information to the official ration shopkeepers.
It will also prepare a list of gas agencies and ration shops attached to them in collaboration with the designated officer of the oil company at the district level. Applications for new gas connection will also be given in the ration shop. When the ration card holders come to the official ration shop to take kerosene, they will fill the gas connection form through the shopkeeper. However, if the ration card holder does not come to take kerosene, the form of gas connection will be filled by the ration card holder on the basis of the list given by the government.
The families who will be eligible under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana and the extended Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana-2 will be given gas connections under the central government scheme. The remaining ration card holder families will be given gas connections from the state scheme. Most of the ration card holder families will be eligible under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana and the extended Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana-2.
At present, there are 52,000 fair price shops and 2122 gas agencies in the state. According to this, 25 fair price shopkeepers will be appointed in one gas agency.
Also, photocopies of the following documents will be taken from the beneficiaries: 1) Ration Card, 2) Aadhar Card of the family head and other family members, 3) Bank Details of the beneficiary (family head woman)
