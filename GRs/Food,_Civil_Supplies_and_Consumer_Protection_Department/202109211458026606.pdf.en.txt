Government Resolution No: GRASS 2021/ PR No. 56/ GRASS-4
Hutatma Rajguru Chowk, Madame Cama Marg, Mantralaya, Mumbai 32.
Date is September 21, 2021.
Reference: Letter from the Chairman, State Consumer Grievances Redressal Commission No. SCDRC/ Mah/ Desk-1/ Notification/ 2462/2021, Dy. 23.08.2021
Introduction: As per Section 36 of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, it is mandatory to have a Chairperson for hearing of cases in the District Consumer Redressal Commission as the Chairperson and at least one Member are required to sit together. However, as per Rule 6 of the Consumer Protection (Salary, Allowances and Conditions of Service of President and Members of the State Commission and District Commission) Model Rules, 2020, the State Government is empowered to appoint the senior-most member to the vacant post of President during the casual vacancy of the post of Chairman in the State Commission and District Commission.
According to the rules, if the chairman of a state commission or the chairman of a district commission is on leave, the senior-most member of the concerned commission can run the affairs of the commission during the leave period as the in-charge chairman. Since the absence of the Chairman of the Commission for a temporary period will not stall the functioning of any Consumer Commission and the senior-most member of the remaining two members will be able to effectively conduct the hearing as the in-charge Chairman, the State Government has been requested to issue a standing order in this regard. Following this, the government took decision on this request.
Government's decision:
In case of casual vacancy caused due to leave or other reasons (except where the post has fallen vacant due to the expiry of the term of office) of the Chairperson of the State Commission and District Commission under Rule 6 of the Consumer Protection (Salary, Allowances and Conditions of Service of President and Members of the State Commission and District Commission) Model Rules, 2020, the senior-most Member (in order of appointment) of the Commission concerned shall look after the proceedings of the hearing in the Commission as in-charge Chairperson during such period. The powers of the senior-most member in charge of the post of Chairperson of the State Commission or Chairperson of the District Commission shall automatically lapse on his re-appointment to the post.
