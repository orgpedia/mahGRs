The Government has decided to implement the" Decentralized Procurement Scheme" in the entire State as per the directions of the Central Government from both Kharif and Rabi Marketing Season 2016-17. The government has taken a decision. The scheme is being implemented across the state. Earlier, the rice produced by the Food Corporation of India (FCI) under the Minimum Support Price (MSP) procurement scheme was stored in the godowns under its control. However, from 2016-17, the rice produced under the Decentralized Procurement Scheme is stored in the state government godowns and distributed under the targeted public distribution system. To store the CMR generated under the Minimum Support Price Purchase Scheme, it is necessary to take the help of other departments of the government and the corporation for this work. The Maharashtra State Warehousing Corporation is a public sector enterprise under the Department of Cooperation, Marketing and Textiles, Government of Maharashtra. Earlier, the Maharashtra State Warehousing Corporation (MSWMC) used to take the godowns on rent while the procurement was done through the Food Corporation of India (FCI). However, considering this, the government was considering to lease out the godowns of the Maharashtra State Fertilizers Corporation and the Agricultural Produce Market Committees under the Marketing Department at the rate lower than that of the Food Corporation of India and the Maharashtra State Fertilizers Corporation for storing the rice or other grain stocks purchased by the state government. The government has taken the following decisions:

The concerned District Supply Officer shall submit a report to the Maharashtra State Warehousing Corporation and the Agricultural Produce Market Committee at least on May 1500. Ensure availability of godowns (having all facilities prescribed by Central Government for storage of paddy/ CMR) for storage of paddy upto tonnage. After verifying this, they should submit a reservation proposal for the available warehouse.
Before renting the warehouses of the Agricultural Produce Market Committees, a certificate regarding the condition of the warehouses and the rent payable should be obtained from the Public Works Department. The contract should be signed at the rate which is lower than the Public Works Department rate and the Provisional Cost Sheet. Also, the concerned agency will be responsible for the insurance of the stock in the warehouse, pest control measures, safety logs, weight cut availability, etc. as per the prevailing conditions of the Central Warehousing Corporation and State Warehousing Corporation.
Before storing the goods in the rented warehouse, the quality of the goods will be certified by the Quality Controller (Q.C.) appointed by the Department and a certificate will be issued to the said organization.
After the grain is accepted by the Quality Controller (Q.C.), the actual weight of the grain while receiving the grain in the warehouse will be checked to ensure the prescribed humidity and after that it will be recorded with the joint signature of the representative of the warehouse head and the District Supply Officer. These records will be used for all future purposes.
After the rice obtained from the paddy purchased by the state government arrives in the warehouse for storage, the warehouse owner will be required to submit the details of the arrival to the concerned district supply officer within 48 hours from the date of arrival. It must also be recorded on a computer system.
