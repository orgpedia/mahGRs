Government Decision: There have been a large number of complaints that milk and other goods in the state are being sold at a higher price than the printed price.
As per the provisions of the Validation of Value Added Goods Rules, 2011, it is an offence to sell goods at a price higher than the printed price. The responsibility of implementing the said rules lies with the Validating System and the Inspectors perform the said function. However, given the scope of geographical jurisdiction and responsibility vested with the Inspector, it is not possible for the Inspector to keep a check on all the places and timings of such unscrupulous traders. As a result, consumers are being exploited.
With a view to curb the said malpractices, the Government issued a Government Resolution on 21st January, 2016 for the formation of Vigilance Committees at the State level and at the Municipal Corporation level.
