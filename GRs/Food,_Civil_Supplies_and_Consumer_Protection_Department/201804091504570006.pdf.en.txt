Government Resolution No: Gobhade-2016/ P.S. No. 135/ N.P. 29
Hutatma Rajguru Chowk, Madam Cama Marg
Ministry, Mumbai- 400 032.
Date: 9th of April 2018
The Proposal:
The Government was considering payment of pending rent dues of private/ cooperative godowns taken on rent from the agent agencies for storage of paddy procured under Minimum Support Price Procurement Scheme for the season 2009-10 to 2014-15 at the rate of Public Works Department.
The rent of the institutions for the period 2009-10 to 2014-15 has been paid at the rate of Central Government. However, the godown owners insist that the rent be paid as per the taxes paid by the agent agencies to the godown owners. During this period, paddy was stored in these godowns for more than the stipulated period of two months for various reasons. The owners of the godowns had demanded that they should get the rent for the entire period at the rate of the Public Works Department. Since the matter does not fall under the norms of the Central Government, the compensation for it will not be received by the Central Government. Hence, the proposal was sent to the state government for approval. " Considering the overall benefit accrued to the agent agencies during the implementation of the scheme in the last few years, the government will have to bear additional penalty for payment of pending warehouse rent dues and since it is not possible to bear it due to the current financial constraints, the agent agencies should pay the pending dues from their profit without making separate funds available from the government," the finance department said in a statement. Accordingly, the following orders are passed.
