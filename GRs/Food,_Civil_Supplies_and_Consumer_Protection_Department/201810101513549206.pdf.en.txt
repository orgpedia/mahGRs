Circular:
It has been decided to implement the Decentralized Procurement Scheme in the entire State from 2016-17 procurement season. Instructions have been issued to all concerned regarding procurement of Millets in Kharif Marketing Season 2018-2019 under Minimum Support Price (MSP) procurement Scheme, as per Government decision dated 29.09.2018.
The procurement period for Kharif Marketing Season (KMS) 2018-2019 is from 1st November, 2018 to 31st December, 2018. As per the procurement policy of the Central Government, the coarse grains purchased under the State Base Price Purchase Scheme under the Decentralized Purchase Scheme are to be distributed in the state itself. Accordingly, in the district where sorghum and maize are to be purchased in the state, the distribution of sorghum and maize to the beneficiaries of the Antyodaya Anna Yojana and priority families should be done by reducing the quantity of wheat accordingly.
3. It is hereby advised to reduce the allocation of wheat and to make mutual allocation of jowar and maize in the month of November, 2018 in the same month in which the procurement of jowar and maize will be done in your district in the Kharif Marketing Season 2018-2019.

4. Procurement and distribution of sorghum and maize to be dealt with as follows: (a) The District Supply Officer shall control the purchase of sorghum and maize through the Procurement Officer of his district and deposit the purchased sorghum and maize in the warehouse of the District Supply Officer through the agent societies immediately and give such certificate (receipt) to the agent society. Also, the updated data of procurement should be submitted to the government (NAPU-29 office) immediately. The District Supply Officer will be fully responsible for ensuring that there is no discrepancy in the data of the agent agency and the District Supply Officer.
(b) The lifting of wheat by the Food Corporation of India should be reduced in proportion to the distribution of sorghum and maize.
(c) Joint inspection of the procurement of Jowar and Maize under the Base Price Purchase Scheme shall be done by the Food Corporation of India and the District Representative (Quality Controller). Therefore, prior to the distribution of sorghum and maize, joint inspection should be done immediately by contacting the regional office of the Food Corporation of India. Distribution of sorghum and maize should be started immediately after the report of the joint inspection is received from the District Supply Officer.

All concerned should be informed that disciplinary action will be taken against the concerned if such negligence is found this year or in the future.
(f) after the distribution of the said sorghum and maize, the information regarding the monthly lifting allocation of the allocated sorghum, maize and wheat in lieu of the allocation of the total wheat, according to the month in which the sorghum and maize have been allocated, the quantity in which the sorghum, maize and wheat have been allocated.
