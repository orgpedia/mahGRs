The proposal-
The Minimum Support Price (MSP) scheme is a central government scheme that helps farmers sell their produce at a lower price than the guaranteed price.
For this purpose, the Maharashtra State Co-op will be formed through the agent agencies appointed by the state government (in non-tribal areas. Marketing Federation, Mumbai and in tribal areas, Maharashtra State Cooperative Tribal Development Corporation, Nashik) procures paddy and millets of FAQ (Fair Average Quality) in the state. Under the above scheme, the paddy procured from the millers through the agent agencies was being collected and the CMR (Custom Milled Rice) was being deposited with the Food Corporation of India. Considering the recommendation of the Central Government regarding the implementation of the Decentralized Procurement Scheme (DCPS) for paddy in the State, the State Government has decided to implement the Decentralized Procurement Scheme in the entire State from the 2016-17 season.
It is necessary to strictly check whether the CMR (rice) is prepared as per the central government's norms by mixing the paddy and paddy purchased under this scheme. Even after joint inspection by the Food Corporation of India and the State Government, many complaints are being received regarding quality control. At that time, to avoid problems in quality control, the government was considering the quality control of paddy and CMR (rice) through a third-party agency along with the existing system. The government has taken the following decisions:
