To increase the income of fair price shopkeepers in the state, the government has issued various government decisions for the sale of various consumer goods distributed under the targeted public distribution system through fair price shops for many years. But the various provisions of all these government decisions should be available at one place so that the public gets to know about all these schemes and government officials can be facilitated in the successful implementation of these schemes.
