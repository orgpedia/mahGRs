Government Resolution No: Purchase- 1020/ PR No. 75/ NO. 29
The suggestions given by the Central Government regarding the use of Bardana should be considered. The officials of the concerned agent agencies should themselves ensure that the gunny bags are supplied to the procurement center according to the weight and quality of the gunny bags.
8.6 The District Supply Officers shall ensure that the gunny bags filled with wheat are in the prescribed quantity or not.

8.7 Only 50 kg bardana should be used for wheat.
Procurement System: Each village should be connected to a particular procurement centre. If the farmer of the village takes wheat to another procurement center, then he should not buy his wheat at that center. The District Collector and the Procurement Agent should take care to give adequate publicity about the procurement centres and the names of the villages attached to each procurement centre. Farmers will have to register themselves for online purchase of wheat. For this, online registration, Aadhaar number and savings bank account number will have to be registered. This purchase has to be registered on the platform of NeML NCDEX Group Company. As per the guidelines of the Central Government, it is mandatory to register online in PFMS (Public Fund Monitoring System). Wheat should be purchased only after seeing the 7/12 ratio of the land owned by the farmers. Make sure that the area under the wheat is recorded in this passage. Note 7/12 on the back of the receipt. 7/12 should not be returned to the farmers. A village-wise register should be prepared in accordance with the wheat brought by the farmers for sale at the purchase center. It should include 1) Name of the farmer, 2) Survey/ group number and area, 3) Details of wheat brought for sale at the centre. So, once the wheat is brought back, by extracting the earlier 7/12 from this register, the farmers can ensure that the wheat brought is of their own production. Before accepting wheat brought by truck or similar vehicle, it should be fully ensured that the grain belongs to the same farmer. It has been observed that in some places, paddy is procured on a very large scale (indirectly by traders) without considering the area under paddy and the average productivity. Therefore, wheat should be purchased by taking into account the area under the crop as per section 7/12 of the farmers, the crop situation (payawari) this year, and the average production of the crop. The District Supply Officer shall supply wheat to the District Agriculture Officer of his respective district.
# Page 8
Government Resolution No: Purchase- 1020/ PR No. 75/ NO. 29
The district-wise productivity should be obtained and reported to both the agent agencies. Both the agent agencies should ensure that the wheat is purchased on the basis of this production.
Every day after the closure of the procurement center in the evening, the responsibility of handling the wheat brought to the procurement center, but not purchased, will be the responsibility of the concerned farmer. Considering the possibility of last year's old wheat being re-sold by the traders at the purchase center, the agents should take special care that last year's old wheat will not be purchased under any circumstances and only the new wheat produced by the farmers will be purchased. If wheat is purchased from old and non-farmers, then the full responsibility of it will be on the agent.
10. Storage of procured wheat: 10.1 The procuring wheat should be stored by the agent agencies in their own godowns. Both the agencies will be responsible till the wheat is handed over to the District Supply Officer. The concerned Collector will be responsible for storage, storage, transportation/ mobilization etc. of such paddy after the quality inspection and weighing is submitted to the concerned District Supply Officer by the wheat agent agencies. The records in this regard should be taken regularly in the warehouse account by the office of the District Supply Officer. If the need arises to store the grain in the open, before storing it, arrangements should be made to provide drainage under and around such grain bags and to cover them completely with sufficient palm leaves. Also, the paddy should be protected from pests by timely pivoting by a regular contractor as per the need. In any case, the grain stock stored in the open will not get wet due to rain, and the grain bags will not get wet from below or from the side, and even if such stock remains in the open during the rainy season, the grain will not be spoiled. In this regard, the Government letter in Annexure' B," Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Protection Department No. The Code prescribed under Section 129/15/ PR No. 2579/ N.P. 29, dated 3rd August, 1998 should be scrupulously followed.
10.2 The Collector/ District Supply Officer shall physically verify that the wheat is of FAQ quality while taking possession of it. Also, the certificate should be sent to the Food Corporation of India.
10.3 The details of the wheat stored in the godown should be submitted to the Government within one week after the expiry of the wheat procurement period. A copy of the FAQ certificate should also be submitted.
