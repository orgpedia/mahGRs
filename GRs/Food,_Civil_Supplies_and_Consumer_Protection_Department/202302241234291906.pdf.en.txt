The Food Corporation of India (FCI) is the nodal agency for the central government in Maharashtra. Whereas, the State Government on behalf of Food Corporation of India implements the scheme of procurement at the base price in the State through Government approved Agencies. The paddy procured under the scheme is procured from millers through agent agencies and the CMR (rice) received is deposited in the government godowns for distribution under the Public Distribution System from the season 2016-17.
