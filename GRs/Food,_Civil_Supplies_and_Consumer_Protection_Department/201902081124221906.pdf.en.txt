Preamble: Under the Department of Revenue and Forestry. As per the Government decision dated 31.10.2018, in 151 Taluks of the State, Rs. As per the Government decision dated 6.11.2018, in addition to the above 151 Taluks, 268 Revenue Circles in other Taluks have been declared as severe/ moderate drought during Kharif 2018. Also, the Forest and Wildlife Department. As per the Government decision dated 8.1.2019, drought like situation has been declared in 151 Taluks and 268 Revenue Circles and 931 villages. The government is considering to take action to make it convenient for the eligible people of these taluks, revenue circles and villages to get food grains at subsidized rates. Under the National Food Security Act, 2013, the Central Government has given a fixed amount of foodgrains to the eligible and needy beneficiaries within the limit of the prescribed amount. In order to facilitate the eligible people who are not getting the benefit of subsidized food grains in the above mentioned taluks, revenue circles and villages where drought has been declared, the following instructions are being issued:

A person who is not covered under the National Food Security Scheme in 151 talukas, 268 revenue circles, 931 villages that have been declared drought in the 2018 kharif season but is holding a yellow or saffron ration card, will demand to be eligible for subsidized food grains.

Government Circular No: Drought 2018/ PR No. 135/ NAPU-22
The reference No. 1 to 8 and No. 10 All members of the ration card should be included in the National Food Security Scheme as soon as possible by computerizing their ration cards and Aadhaar seeding of all members of the Antyodaya Anna Yojana and priority family beneficiaries within the limits of their income and income as per the criteria laid down under the above Government decisions.
The citizens of the above 151 talukas, 268 revenue boards and 931 villages who do not have ration cards, should take immediate action to issue ration cards to them in the category of payment according to the criteria and annual income issued by the government from time to time.
At present, food grains are being distributed to the eligible beneficiaries of the food security scheme in the state through POS machines, according to which food grains are being distributed after biometric identification of eligible beneficiaries. The records of all eligible beneficiaries in the state are available on AePDS system and the facility of portability has been provided through the use of POS device. Portability through that facility is allowing eligible ration card holders to avail the benefit of foodgrains. Therefore, eligible ration card holders of the above 151 taluks, 268 revenue circles and 931 villages where drought has been declared, will be facilitated to lift food grains from any other fair price shop as per their convenience, if they are unable to lift food grains from the fair price shop set up due to migration. As the drought is causing migration of citizens mainly in urban and semi-urban areas, special attention needs to be paid by the District Supply Officer/ Tahsildar/ Deputy Controller to facilitate the eligible beneficiaries to use the portability facility on the PoS machine. Immediate action needs to be taken on this. All concerned should ensure that foodgrains are made available to eligible beneficiaries at their place of migration and they are not deprived of their entitled foodgrains due to migration.
