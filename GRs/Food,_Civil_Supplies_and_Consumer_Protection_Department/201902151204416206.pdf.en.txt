Government Resolution No: Purchase-1014/ PR No.17/ NAPU-29, dated 14.01.2016 2) Government Resolution No: Purchase 1018/ PR No. No. 185/ NAPU-29, dated 29.09.2018 Preamble- The Government has decided to implement the Decentralized Procurement Scheme in the entire State as per the directions of the Central Government from both Kharif and Rabi Marketing Season 2016-17. The government has taken a decision. The scheme is being implemented across the state. Earlier, the rice produced by the Food Corporation of India (FCI) under the Minimum Support Price (MSP) procurement scheme was stored in the godowns under its control. However, from 2016-17, the rice produced under the decentralized procurement scheme is to be deposited in the state government godowns and distributed under the targeted public distribution system. Since the Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Protection Department does not have adequate storage systems, it is necessary to take the help of other government departments and corporations for this work. The Maharashtra State Warehousing Corporation is a public sector enterprise under the Department of Cooperation, Marketing and Textiles, Government of Maharashtra.
Earlier, the Maharashtra State Warehousing Corporation (MSWMC) used to take the godowns on rent while the procurement was done through the Food Corporation of India (FCI). However, considering this, the government was considering to lease out the godowns of the Maharashtra State Fertilizers Corporation and the Agricultural Produce Market Committees under the Marketing Department at the rate lower than that of the Food Corporation of India and the Maharashtra State Fertilizers Corporation for storing the rice or other grain stocks purchased by the state government. The government has taken the following decisions:
