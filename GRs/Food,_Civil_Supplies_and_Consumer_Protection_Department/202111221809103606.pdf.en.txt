Read: 1. Government Corrigendum No: Purchase-2621/ PR No.138/ No. Dated the 29th September 2021
Introduction: In the government decision, instructions were issued to connect a particular village to a particular procurement center for the sale of paddy. However, the condition of selling paddy to farmers at a particular paddy procurement center is becoming difficult for the farmers to sell paddy, so the public representatives have been repeatedly demanding the government to relax this condition. Accordingly, the following changes in the government's decision were under consideration.
Government's stand:
In the above-mentioned Government Decision, para. Instead of 7.1, the following is being added:
7.1 Each village should be linked to a particular shopping centre. Collectors and procurement agencies should ensure that adequate publicity is given about the procurement centres and the names of the villages attached to each procurement centre.
The area and village-wise list of farmers attached to the procurement centres should be obtained from the Talatha and recorded in the register at the procurement centre.
If more than one village is connected to a single shopping centre, a separate village-wise register should be maintained at such a centre. This register should be made available to the district supply officer at the time of inspection of the procurement center.
Farmers can sell their produce anywhere in the district. Accordingly, the farmers registered for the sale of paddy at the paddy procurement center should be registered in the village-wise register at the purchase center. This register should be made available to the district supply officer at the time of inspection of the procurement center.
