Preamble: Directions for implementation of the" Decentralized Procurement Scheme" under the Minimum Support Price Procurement Scheme for the Marketing Season 2021-2022 in the entire State. 1 has been decided by the government. This is the 2021-22 season. Commenced from 01.10.2021 and accordingly instructions for procurement of paddy procured under Minimum Support Price Procurement Scheme have been issued vide Reference No. 2 Government circulars have been issued here.
At present, the district coordination committee headed by the district collector selects the procurement centres for paddy procurement. Paddy is procured from the farmers registered under Minimum Support Price (MSP) procurement scheme at these procurement centres and stored in the premises/ godowns of the procurement centres. After this, the paddy is handed over to the millers for milling through the concerned District Marketing Officer/ Regional Manager.
In this, the responsibility of the paddy purchased at the procurement center is of the concerned procurement center. Similarly, the mill owner is responsible for transporting the paddy to the paddy mill and delivering the rice obtained from the mill to the government godown where the CMR is installed and the District Marketing Officer/ Regional Manager controls all these stages.
At the agent level, there is not enough storage capacity for paddy. It has also been observed that in some places, there is no scientific storage.
Also, the central government provides only 2 months' warehouse rent for storing paddy.
Due to all these things, paddy is being stored in the open at the procurement centers. The rain and other

The reasons can be damage to the crop. In order to avoid losses due to all these factors, in view of the delay in the procurement of paddy procured for the Rabi season starting from May 2022, the government was considering to hand over the paddy procured at the procurement centre to the miller for storage before the procurement and to hand over the joint custody of the paddy to the District Marketing Officer/ Regional Manager and the concerned miller.
Government's decision:
Under this Government decision, approval is being given to the millers to store the paddy purchased at the procurement center in the 2021-22 (Rabi) season. The joint custody of the paddy will be with the District Marketing Officer/ Regional Manager and the concerned millers. This will be implemented on a pilot basis for the 2021-22 Rabi season.
Considering the rainy season in Rabi season and the problems arising out of it, the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) to be followed by the concerned agent agencies for handing over the paddy procured at the procurement centre to the local/ nearby miller as soon as possible is as follows:
While giving the miller to store the paddy procured under the Minimum Support Price Procurement Scheme, the daily loading capacity, storage capacity etc. of the mill should be considered.

III. The miller in whose premises the paddy is to be stored shall deposit a security deposit amount of Rs. 125/-per tonne with the agent agency.
(iv) In addition to the security deposit for the purpose of milling of paddy, the rice miller shall pay to the miller the amount of the security deposit for milling of paddy. 2) Deposit of security deposit.
V. Paddy will be made available to the millers for ploughing in the same quantity as is available at the paddy procurement centres. Any time when paddy is not available or the agent agency or the government wants, it will be stopped from giving paddy in bulk.
VI. 20% of the storage capacity of eligible millers should be stored first. In any case, the rice should not be stored in such a way that some paddy millers have large stocks of paddy in the first place.
