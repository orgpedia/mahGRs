Introduction: Base Price Purchase Scheme is a Central Government Scheme and is implemented by the State Governments. Under this scheme, the decentralized paddy procurement scheme is implemented in the state from the 2016-17 season.
Paddy, jowar, bajra and maize procured under the scheme are distributed through fair price shops under the targetted public distribution system.
There is a huge prevalence of anaemia in the country and the state. According to the fourth National Health Survey 2015-16, 53.8% of children in Maharashtra (age 6 months to 5 years), 38% of girls aged 10 to 18 years and 56% of pregnant women are found to be anaemic. Anemia is caused by a deficiency of Vitamin A, B9/ folate and B12 in the diet. It has been proved through research that if iron and other nutrients are given from food in sufficient quantity then anemia can be controlled to a great extent. At present, the government is trying to control anemia by giving iron tablets etc. The government was considering measures to address the issue. A proposal to take such measures through foodgrains distributed under the public distribution system was submitted to the government by the Tata Trust. Accordingly, it was decided to implement the project of fortifying rice distributed under the Public Distribution System in Bhamragad and Kurkheda talukas of Gadchiroli district on a pilot basis in collaboration with Tata Trust. Accordingly, the following decisions are taken:
Government Decision The project for distribution of fortified rice under Public Distribution System (PDS) is being approved on a pilot basis for 12 months from the date of commencement of the pilot project in Bhamragad and Kurkheda taluks of Gadchiroli district.
Since the project is on a pilot basis, any miller in Gadchiroli district will be selected by a joint decision of Tata Trust, the district collector and the state government to fortify rice during the milling process.
