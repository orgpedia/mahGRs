Introduction: There is a huge prevalence of anaemia in the country and the state. According to the fourth National Family Health Survey 2015-16, 53.8% of children (age 6 months to 5 years), 38% of girls aged 10 to 18 years and 56% of pregnant women in Maharashtra have been found to be anaemic. Anemia is caused by a deficiency of Vitamin A, B9/ folate and B12 in the diet. It has been proved through research that if iron and other nutrients are given from food in sufficient quantity then anemia can be controlled to a great extent. At present the government is trying to control anemia by giving iron tablets etc. But it requires a different system.
