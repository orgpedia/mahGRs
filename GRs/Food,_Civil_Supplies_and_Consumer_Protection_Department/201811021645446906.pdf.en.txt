The Government of Maharashtra
Department of Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Protection
Government Resolution No: NISHIKA- 2118/ PR No. 105/ NOP 15
Madam Cama Marg, Hutatma Rajguru Chowk,
Ministry (Extension), Mumbai
The date: November 2, 2018.
The Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs Department is a separate department like other departments of the State Government. This department deals with the supply of goods in the state. There is a separate system at the district level. The separate figure of this department has been issued by the Government Decision dated 26th June, 2003. The entry into service of the posts in this department is independent of rules.
It has been observed by the Government that all the posts created in the supply system diagram at the district and division level are shown on the establishment of the Collector and Divisional Commissioner, instead of separately on the establishment of the Supply Department, and are considered to be on the revenue establishment. Actually, this assumption is completely wrong.
3. As mentioned above, the supply department has a separate structure. The posts in the supply department have their own separate service entry rules. Therefore, the posts of supply department at the district level are not of the revenue department, but of the supply department. In view of this fact, the establishment of posts of the Supply Department should be considered separately and the figure and point wise of the Group-C and Group-D posts of the Supply Department in the office of the Collector and Divisional Commissioner should be kept separately.
The proceedings should be completed within one month and its report should be submitted to the government without fail.
This decision has been made available on the website of the Government of Maharashtra with code 201811021645446906. This order is being issued by digital signature.
By order and in the name of the Governor of Maharashtra.
