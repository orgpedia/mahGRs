Collectors and procurement agencies should take care to give adequate publicity to the names of the villages. Online procurement system has been started while purchasing paddy/ coarse grains from farmers. For this, the farmers need to be registered. For this, online registration, Aadhaar number and savings bank account number is being registered. For this online purchase, it is mandatory to register on the platform of NeML NCDEX Group Company for the season 2019-20 and make those records PFMS (Public Fund Monitoring System) as per the instructions of the Central Government. Paddy/ Coarse Cereals should be purchased only after seeing the 7/12 ratio of the land owned by the farmers. It should be ensured that the area under sorghum and other cereals/ paddy is recorded in the said chart. Note 7/12 on the back of the receipt. 7/12 should not be returned to the farmer. Online registrations should be made and village-wise registers should be prepared according to the paddy/ millets brought by the farmers for sale at the procurement center. These should include 1) Name of the farmer, 2) Survey/ Group Number and Area, 3) Paddy/ Jowar, Bajra, Maize and Ragi brought for sale at the centre.

Before accepting the paddy/ coarse grains brought by truck or similar vehicle, it should be fully ensured that the paddy/ coarse grains belong to the real farmer. It has been observed that in some places, paddy is procured on a very large scale (indirectly by traders) without considering the area under paddy and the average productivity. Therefore, paddy/ coarse grains should be procured by taking into account the area under the crop as per section 7/12 of the farmers, the cropping situation of this year (Paiswari) and the average production of the crop.

In any case, the grain stock stored in the open will not get wet due to rain, and the grain bags will not get wet from below or from the side, and even if such stock remains in the open during the rainy season, the grain outside the warehouse should be arranged from the beginning.
