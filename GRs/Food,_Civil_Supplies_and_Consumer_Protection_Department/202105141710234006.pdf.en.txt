Introduction: Minimum Support Price Purchase Scheme is a Central Government scheme, which is implemented so that farmers do not have to sell food grains at a lower price than the guaranteed price. For this purpose, the Maharashtra State Co-op will be formed through the agent agencies appointed by the state government (in non-tribal areas. Marketing Federation, Mumbai and in tribal areas, Maharashtra State Cooperative Tribal Development Corporation, Nashik) procures paddy and millets of FAQ (Fair Average Quality) in the state. The CMR obtained by millers through the agency agencies for the paddy procured under the above scheme.
Custom milled rice was being deposited with the Food Corporation of India. Considering the recommendation of the Central Government regarding the implementation of the" Decentralized Procurement Scheme" (DCPS) for paddy in the State, the State Government has decided to implement the Decentralized Procurement Scheme in the entire State from the 2016-17 season.
The Central Government has allotted Rs. 10/- per quintal has been announced. As the millers in the state could not afford to pay the same price, there was a demand that the state government should announce a higher rate than the one announced by the central government in the state, like some other states. In view of this, the Government of India has decided to increase the MSP for Kharif Marketing Season (2019-20) and Kharif Marketing Season (2020-21). However, as the paddy procurement in the state has declined in Kharif 2020-21 season, it will not be economically viable to produce rice as per the norms of the central government even at a higher procurement rate.
It has also been demanded from the government to sanction special heavy subsidy in Kharif Marketing Season 2020-21 in the wake of unseasonal rains, hailstorm and Corona epidemic.
