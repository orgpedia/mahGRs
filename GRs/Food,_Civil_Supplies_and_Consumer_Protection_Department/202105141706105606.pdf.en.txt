Introduction: Minimum Support Price Purchase Scheme is a Central Government scheme, which is implemented so that farmers do not have to sell food grains at a lower price than the guaranteed price. For this purpose, the Maharashtra State Co-op will be formed through the agent agencies appointed by the state government (in non-tribal areas. Marketing Federation, Mumbai and in tribal areas, Maharashtra State Cooperative Tribal Development Corporation, Nashik) procures paddy and millets of FAQ (Fair Average Quality) in the state. Under the above scheme, the paddy procured from the millers through the agent agencies was being collected and the CMR (Custom Milled Rice) was being deposited with the Food Corporation of India.
Considering the recommendation of the Central Government regarding the implementation of the" Decentralized Procurement Scheme" (DCPS) for paddy in the State, the State Government has decided to implement the Decentralized Procurement Scheme in the entire State from the 2016-17 season.
The Central Government has allotted Rs. 10/- per quintal has been announced. As the millers in the state could not afford to pay the same price, there was a demand that the state government should announce a higher rate than the one announced by the central government in the state, like some other states.
No additional amount has been sanctioned for paddy procurement in 2019-20 season. Keeping this in view, the Government was considering to announce a higher MSP for Kharif Marketing Season 2019-20 and Kharif Marketing Season 2020-21 in addition to the MSP announced by the Government of India.
