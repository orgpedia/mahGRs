Introduction:- The Centrally Sponsored Minimum Support Price (MSP) procurement scheme is implemented by the State Government on behalf of the Food Corporation of India. The main objective of the scheme is to provide remunerative prices to farmers for their produce. The" Decentralized Procurement Scheme" is being implemented in the entire State from 2016-17 season under which paddy and coarse grains are procured in non-tribal areas through Marketing Federation, Mumbai and in tribal areas through Tribal Development Corporation, Nashik. Instead of depositing the CMR with the Food Corporation of India (FCI), the paddy procured by these agent agencies is deposited in the district government godowns through the respective millers. As per the MoU signed between the State Government, Central Government and Food Corporation of India, the primary responsibility of distribution of CMR and coarse cereals under the Minimum Support Price (MSP) procurement scheme to the beneficiaries under the National Food Security Scheme is with the State Government. The Central Government has fixed the transportation rate of paddy and CMR. As per the guidelines given under the letter dated 06.05.2019, the State Level Committee has been instructed to recommend to the Central Government the rates obtained after the tender process at the district level based on the SOR (Schedule of Rates) of transportation fixed by the State Level Committee. Accordingly, the State Level Committee for the season 2021-22 has been constituted. The transport rates recommended by the District Collectors in view of the tenders floated at the district level based on the SoRs approved in the meeting dated 25.11.2021 were approved by the State Level Committee. This has been approved in the meeting dated 07.06.2022.
Central government. In the letter dated 06.05.2019, it has been stated that the rates of these SoRs will be applicable for a maximum period of two years. Therefore, it was under the consideration of the Government to fix the rates for transportation of paddy, CMR and coarse grains in the season 2021-22, as per the procurement of 18475199.75 quintals of paddy under the season 2022-23, approximately 12378383.83 quintals of CMR would be made available under the National Food Security Scheme.
