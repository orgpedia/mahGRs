There is a provision that the amount has to be deposited in the name of the financial advisor and deputy secretary by the money lender along with the agreement. The successful supplier has uploaded the said reserve amount through EPBG (Electronic Performance Bank Guarantee) on the Online GeM Portal, hence there is no need to accept the reserve amount separately. It has been sent to primary and secondary buyers through SFMS (Security Finance Message Service). After the primary and secondary buyers complete their process, their bank will complete the process, after which the supplier will be able to generate the bill (e-way) from the GeM Portal. The Controller, Rationing, Financial Adviser and Deputy Secretary should complete this process on a war footing.
3. Paragraph No. 6.4 After delivery by the Supplier, the delivery challan shall be stamped by the District Supply Officer/ Assistant District Supply Officer/ Food Distribution Officer after affixing the signature of the Warehouseman/ Warehouseman in possession of the bales. Related
The Warehouseman/ Warehouse Manager shall ensure that the bales are of ISI mark quality and weigh 50/60 kg.
A certificate was required to be provided. However, in order to bring it in line with the functioning of the GeM portal, changes are being made in Annexure-A and the certificate as per Annexure-A should be submitted to the Office of the Financial Adviser and Deputy Secretary, Mumbai.
A copy of the revised Annexure-A is annexed herewith.
4. As per GeM Portal procedure, the supplier supplies the bales of twine to the concerned District Warehouse and the receiving District Supply Office receives the bales on the same day.
