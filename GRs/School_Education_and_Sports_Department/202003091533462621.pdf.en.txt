Department of School Education and Sports
Government Resolution No. 1719/ P.No. 28/ CRUSE-2
Madam Cama Marg, Hutatma Rajguru Chowk,
Mantralaya Extension, Mumbai- 400 032,
Date of release: March 9, 2020
Preamble: As per the Government Decision dated 09.12.2010 of the Department of School Education and Sports, the procedure for direct recruitment of high-quality sportspersons into Government service has been prescribed.
As per the decisions of the Government dated 21st May, 2011 and 10th April, 2013, the rules of sports qualification for appointment of general sportspersons in Group A to Group D posts have been fixed and as per the Government decision dated 1st October, 2015, the policy for direct appointment of disabled sportspersons in government service has been fixed. Accordingly, the players eligible for direct recruitment are appointed as per the availability of the respective posts in the department of their choice.
According to this, most of the players have been selected by the Revenue Department, Home Department, etc. according to their choice.
They have been appointed in Group A to Group D posts. However, some of these directly recruited athletes go on long-term leave for their sports training or regular practice, and even during the actual competition period, they have to stay away from the office for a long time. The said players are not able to meet the service entry rules of the respective post of the department in which they are posted. As a result, they face problems in terms of salary and benefits. Hence, the government had decided to form a committee to look into the issue.
Government Decision: The Government is approving the constitution of a Committee to recommend to the Government a comprehensive policy on how long leave should be granted to sportspersons appointed in Government service for practice and participation in international competitions, what should be the criteria for completing their probation period, how leave, salary and increment should be allowed to them, etc.
