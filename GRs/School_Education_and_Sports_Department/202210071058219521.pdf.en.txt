Introduction: The Union Cabinet has approved the PM SHRI (PM Schools for Rising India) Scheme. Approved on 7th September 2022. The project worth Rs. 27360 crore, out of which the Central Government's share is Rs. 18,128 crore and the State Government's share is Rs. 9232 crore. The scheme will be implemented for a period of 5 years and the funding pattern and financial modalities will be as per the prevailing pattern of other Centrally Sponsored Schemes of the Central Government.
The objective of this initiative is to prepare selected existing schools as PM SHRI schools which will implement all aspects of National Education Policy-2020 and emerge as model schools in a time bound manner. More than 14,500 schools across the country will be selected under this scheme. All these schools will be completely transformed keeping in mind inclusiveness, quality and impartiality.
3 Central/ State/ UT/ Urban Local Bodies (managed by KVS/ NVS UDISE-Code) having Primary School (Class 1-5/ 1-8) and Secondary, Higher Secondary School (Class- 10/1-12/ 6-10/6-12) will be considered under the scheme. The selection of PM SHRI schools will be done through a challenge mode. In which the schools will have to self-apply on the Online Challenge Portal. The Online Challenge Portal will be opened four times a year, once every quarter. For the first two years of implementation of the scheme, a maximum of two schools will be selected- one primary and one middle and high school.
A single nodal account will be opened in the authorized bank for the contribution of funds by the state government at the state, district and school level. The agencies implementing the scheme will be able to spend funds from this account at each stage within the prescribed limits. The Ministries/ Departments will transfer the share of Central Government for Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) account to the SNA account of the State Government.
As the selection process for PM SHRI schools is going to start in a short time, the matter of appointing a single coordination mechanism (SNA) and nodal officer for the PM SHRI (PM Schools for Rising India) scheme was under the consideration of the government.
