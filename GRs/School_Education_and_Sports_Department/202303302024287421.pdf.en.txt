# Page 6
GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: ANUV 4922/ (33/22)/ BUDGET (2) 12) The wage subsidy provided by the Government shall be mandatorily credited to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries through ECS. Under no circumstances should the salary subsidy amount be disbursed in lump sum and offline mode.
13) Before disbursing grants to local self-government institutions and corporations, the amount coming to the state government from these institutions should be reviewed and the remaining grants should be disbursed only after recovering those amounts. Also, detailed information should be collected about the utilization of the grants distributed by the government to these institutions and where the unutilized amount is kept. If the unaccounted money is kept in the bank, then its bank account statement should be submitted to the government. If the funds made available for expenditure on a programme are unutilized, the funds should not be released for the same purpose in the current year without the approval of the Finance Department.
14. While drawing payments to beneficiaries under the individual beneficiary programme, grants to individual beneficiaries shall not be drawn unless the list of beneficiaries is fixed and linked to the payment with proper details. The programmes of individual beneficiaries should be linked with Aadhaar number and the subsidy should be disbursed through Electronic Clearance System (ECS) only.
The payment of scholarship/ tuition fee reimbursement, individual beneficiaries as well as subsidized grants, etc. should be made through the Electronic Clearance System (ECS).
16) Work-wise funds are required to be budgeted after obtaining administrative approval/ technical approval in respect of the construction proposal as well as approval of the Committee of Secretaries, where necessary. Once the availability of funds for new works is ensured, the work should be started by issuing tender notices and commissioning orders, and the funds should be distributed as needed. The old works should be reviewed and completed on priority and the funds should not be provided to the Public Works Department in the form of deposit construction.
17) The concerned department should ensure the receipt of funds from the Central Government in respect of the Centrally Sponsored Scheme from the Finance Branch of the Finance Department (no need to refer the funds to the Expenditure/ Budget Branch for this) and thereafter, if the funds have been received, the administrative department should disburse the balance share of the State Government at their level. There is no need to refer the fee separately to the Finance Department for concurrence. However, if the funds of the Central Government for the previous year are to be spent in the current year, it will be mandatory to obtain the consent of the Planning, Tribal Development Department and Social Justice and Special Assistance Department as well as the Finance Department, as the case may be.

# Page 7
GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: ANUV 4922/ (33/22)/ BUDGET (2) Cheques for purchase should be issued in the name of the supplier concerned and through Electronic Clearance System (ECS).
19) Funds are often spent by departments through short payments. However, non-submission of its detailed payment may lead to accounting objections and possible default. However, henceforth, the departments should not draw funds under the head of accounts without the consent of the Finance Department unless they submit the head under which the old detailed payments are pending.
20) The departments should note that it is a kind of irregularity that the funds that have remained unutilized for various reasons are technically shown as spent by the departments by transferring them to their subordinate corporation. Provisions shall not be drawn or disbursed unless the previous unutilized funds under them (kept outside the purview of their own provident fund account/ corporation account or otherwise showing expenditure) have been fully spent. It is also pointed out that under the self-registration accounts, the departments are found to be having huge funds lying unutilized.
