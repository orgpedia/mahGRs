Government Decision No. Parivartan-2021/ No.62/ SD-4.
Madam Cama Marg, Hutatma Rajguru Chowk,
Ministry, Mumbai- 400 032.
Date is June 16, 2021.
Read:- Government Resolution No.RTE-2013/ PR No. 20/ PR-I dated 31st December, 2013.
The Proposal:
In Maharashtra, some government and aided schools are running for classes 5 to 10, classes 8 to 10 and classes 1 to 10. The RTE-2009 Act is applicable to these schools as they also include primary classes. This has been clearly stated in the Preamble of the Government Resolution No.RTE-2013/ PR No. 20/ PR-1 dated 31st December, 2013 of the School Education Department. Section 4 of the RTE Act provides that a student who is not admitted to school shall be admitted to the class in accordance with the age and as per Section 14 (1), age shall be considered as proof of admission.
The government has noticed that for some reasons (e.g. A student of class 9th or 10th (due to financial difficulties or non-payment of fees) is required to obtain a T.C. certificate from his private school.
Students who do not have a transfer certificate or school leaving certificate will not be admitted to a government or aided secondary school. This results in the loss of students and their academic year. As per Section 5 (2) and (3) of the RTE Act, a student shall be entitled to be admitted from one school to another. Under normal circumstances, the school head of the parent school gives a T.C. (Transfer Certificate) immediately for admission to another school. However, if for any reason, such certificate is delayed or denied, it will be unfair to delay admission or deny admission in another school (government or aided).
According to Section 18 of the Secondary School Code, this provision has been clarified in the case of admission from one school to another.

In the secondary school also, the matter of issuing instructions to simplify the process of admission from one school to another as well as admission to age-appropriate classes was under the consideration of the government.
Government's decision:
Students seeking admission in Class 9 or Class 10 from any other school in any government/ municipal/ municipal or private aided secondary school in the state should not be denied admission in the absence of T.C. (Transfer Certificate).
In this regard, according to the provisions of the Secondary School Code, students should be given temporary admission and further necessary action should be taken. If the T.C. (Transfer Certificate) is not received from the previous school, the student should be admitted to the age-appropriate class in the school to be admitted. For this, the proof of date of birth should be considered as proof and age-appropriate admission should be given to the class up to class 10.
The school heads/ principals should ensure that the students are not deprived of admission, and the students are not left out of the school due to discontinuation of education. If such students are deprived, action will be taken against the concerned school/ principal as per rules/ provisions of law.
