Introduction There is a large number of inquiries from the members of the legislature through the legislature arms regarding the recruitment of teachers and non-teaching staff in the state. Also, many proposals are being received from the people's representatives regarding the recruitment. If teachers are not recruited, the dropout rate of students will increase and the academic loss of students and its adverse impact on the quality of education cannot be ruled out. Therefore, in order to avoid the loss of students by making teachers available in the most needed vacancies, the Finance Department is taking action to fill 50 percent of the vacant posts of teachers and non-teaching staff in the state in accordance with the Government Decision dated 31.10.2022.
There are a total of 65,111 posts of primary, middle and high school teachers vacant in the state, out of which 30,000 teachers' posts will be filled. The Minister (School Education) presented weapons during the Budget Session viz. Answers to the questions and recommendations are provided. The vacant posts in the district councils will also be filled.
However, during the recruitment of teachers on the basis of merit in the Teacher Eligibility and Intelligence Test 2017, the government has noticed that in many districts
The disparity is mainly due to the fact that after the appointment of teachers, there is a large number of teacher vacancies in some districts, especially in Zilla Parishad schools, due to such transfers, and at the same time, teachers are becoming surplus in some districts. This is affecting students adversely. Also, the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009, prohibits schools from keeping more than 10 per cent of the posts vacant. Therefore, in accordance with the opinion of the Rural Development Department in this regard, regarding ensuring the number of vacancies for teacher recruitment, the said vacancies
