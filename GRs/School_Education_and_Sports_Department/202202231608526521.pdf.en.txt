Department of School Education and Sports, Government Resolution No.- Rakridho 2002/ No. 68/ Kriuse-2, D. July 01, 2016
Introduction: The players who win medals in national and international competitions bring laurels to the nation as well as the state. Since the opportunities and educational qualifications of the players are the same, it is not possible for them to pay equal attention to both fronts. Often they are behind in academics and are unable to compete with other students in the competition for jobs and professions. Keeping this in mind, the government has given top quality athletes a context. As per the Government decision dated 01.07.2016, it has been decided to provide 5% reservation in jobs. However, considering that sports reservation is an easy way to enter government service, many candidates hold bogus sports certificates.
And on the basis of that they enter into government service. This is unfair to the genuine candidates.
The concerned candidates are sometimes found to be indulging in malpractices in order to obtain bogus sports certificates. Over a period of time, such candidates are found guilty in the inquiry conducted in the wake of complaints being filed with the government regarding bogus player certificates.
The government is taking strict action against such candidates. In fact, such candidates have to be dismissed from the government, so the candidates concerned face great social contempt. Also, those candidates who have a bogus sports certificate but have not yet been appointed in government service will also face life-long action. As a result, young candidates with social and economic disadvantages are unable to determine the direction of life.
Keeping this in view, the Government was contemplating to provide an opportunity to the young candidates holding bogus player certificates who have been victims of inadvertent/ wrongful acts of omission/ commission due to the ongoing anti-graft drive against bogus candidates.
