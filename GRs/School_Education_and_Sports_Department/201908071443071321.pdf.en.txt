Government Circular Finance Department Vepur- 2019/ PR No.15/ Service 9D. May 14, 2019 Introduction: Full-time employees of non-government private schools. The revised pay structure has been approved with effect from 1st January, 2016 as per the Government decision dated 22nd February, 2019. All part-time employees of secondary and higher secondary level and teachers' schools holding equivalent qualifications to full-time employees and having at least half the workload of full-time employees. The matter of approving the revised pay structure from January 1, 2016 was under consideration of the government. The government has already taken the decision in this regard.
Government Decision: The revised pay structure will be based on the pay matrix. For the above mentioned employees, the salary will be as mentioned in the Annexure along with half of the amount of minimum and maximum salary of the General Pay Matrix.
(2) The principle of sanctioning financial assistance to part-time teaching and non-teaching staff to the extent of half of the amount in the pay matrix payable to full-time employees has been adopted.
For this, while determining their revised pay scale as on January 1, 2016, the amount of basic pay in their undefined consolidated pay should be multiplied by 2.57. If the amount completed by multiplying as above is in the cell within the permissible pay level in the revised pay matrix prescribed for the concerned part-time employees, the amount will be revised pay.

If the amount is not in the cell in the permissible pay level, then the minimum pay in the level of the permissible revised pay structure or the amount in the first cell is higher than the amount in the next cell adjacent to the completed amount, then the pay will be fixed at the minimum salary in that level or the salary in the first cell. (This amount is denoted as" A" for further reference.) Dearness allowance should be sanctioned at the prevailing rate on this amount. Since the amount at' A" has already been reduced to half of the amount paid to a full-time employee, this dearness allowance will also be equal to half of the dearness allowance paid to the full-time employee of that post. (This amount is denoted as" B" for further reference.) )
The sum of the amounts mentioned above A and B shall be the cumulative revised entitlements of the part-time employees concerned.
On the lines of full-time employees, all these employees will be given a pay hike in the revised pay structure on January 1 or July 1. The hike will be at the rate of three per cent of the actual salary of the part-time employee. (Since the amounts in A and B above have already been reduced to half of what a full-time employee gets, the increase in salary will be less than the increase in salary payable to a full-time employee in that post).
Also, the possibility of bunching of pay in the revised pay matrix of part-time employees drawing different non-determined salaries cannot be ruled out. In such a case, the benefit of increase in pay shall be admissible to them as per the provisions of Rule (7) of the Maharashtra Civil Services (Revised Pay) Rules, 2019.
3. Special pay should not be sanctioned in the revised pay structure.
The dues to be paid in cash to the concerned employees are to be cleared in 5 equal installments. Orders in this regard will be issued separately. The order will also be applicable to night school teachers. The option required for fixation of pay in the revised pay structure should be given within 2 months of the issue of this order. The option once given will be final.
(5) The additional expenditure arising out of the revised pay structure implemented under this Order shall be covered under the head of accounts under which the allowances of teaching and non-teaching staff are spent and shall be met from the following sanctioned grants: The Director of Education, Maharashtra State, Pune should consider this additional expenditure while preparing the revised estimates.
