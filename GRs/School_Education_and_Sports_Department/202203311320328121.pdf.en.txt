Further grants should not be disbursed unless the utilization of the earlier grant is completed. The treasury officers should not pass the payment unless a copy of the bank account statement for the previous month is attached with the payment submitted for drawing funds from the subsidiary grant.
12) The salary subsidy given by the government will have to be transferred to the bank account of the beneficiaries through ECS. Under no circumstances should the salary subsidy amount be disbursed in lump sum and offline mode.
