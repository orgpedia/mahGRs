However, in the original format, the post of Programme Officer is not of Group-A but of Group-B. Also, his salary was Rs. 9300-34800, Grade Pay is 4800. As the post of Assistant Director (Administration Branch), Group A is not in the equivalent pay scale, it cannot be transferred.

Government Corrigendum No: ARTICLE-2017/ P.S. 41/17/ P.S.-5
The salary for the post of Assistant is Rs. 9300-34800, Grade Pay 4600. However, in the original figure, the post was not sanctioned for the said pay scale and the pay scale of Group-C Senior Short Writer was Rs. 9300-34800, Grade Pay 4400. Hence, the government took this decision. The posts transferred in Form-B at No.71 attached with 31.7.2017 as Personal Assistant, Group B are not in the equivalent pay scale and hence are being excluded.
As per the Government Decision, dated 31.7.2017, 10 posts have been transferred for Divisional Education Authority, Nashik. Among them, the post of sound engineer, Group-B, Professor in the office of Maharashtra State Institute of Visual Education, Pune, Group-B, Salary Range Rs. 9300 34800, Grade Pay 4800 has been transferred as equivalent pay scale post. However, the pay scale for the post of Sound Engineer, Group-B is Rs. 9300-34800, Grade Pay Rs. That's 4400. Therefore, the post of sound engineer in the office of the Divisional Education Authority, Nashik, cannot be transferred to the post of professor (grade pay 4800). Therefore, the transfer at No. 5 in the table under the Divisional Education Authority, Nashik is being excluded as it is not in the equivalent pay scale.
The government has taken three decisions in this regard. 31.7.2017 and Govt. 7.12.2018 should be read in the revised format.
