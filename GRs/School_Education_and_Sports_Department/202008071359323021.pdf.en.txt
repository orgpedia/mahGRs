GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: ANUV 4919/ (32/19)/ Budget 10) The wage subsidy provided by the Government shall be mandatorily credited to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries through ECS. Under no circumstances should the salary subsidy amount be disbursed in lump sum and offline mode.
11) Before disbursing the grants to the local self-government institutions and corporations, the amount coming to the state government from these institutions should be reviewed and the remaining grants should be disbursed only after recovering those amounts. Also, detailed information should be collected about the utilization of the grants distributed by the government to these institutions and where the unutilized amount is kept. If the unaccounted money is kept in the bank, then its bank account statement should be submitted to the government. If the funds made available for expenditure on a programme are unutilized, the funds should not be released for the same purpose in the current year without the approval of the Finance Department.
12. While drawing the payments of beneficiaries under the individual beneficiary programme, the grants of individual beneficiaries shall not be drawn unless the list of beneficiaries is fixed and linked with the payment with proper details. The programmes of individual beneficiaries should be linked with Aadhaar number and the subsidy should be disbursed through Electronic Clearance System (ECS).
Payment of scholarship/ tuition fee reimbursement, individual beneficiaries as well as subsidy etc. should be made through Electronic Clearance System (ECS) only. All such details should be linked to Aadhaar.
Administrative approval/ technical approval in respect of the construction proposal as well as the approval of the Committee of Secretaries, where necessary, shall be obtained and the work-wise funds shall be budgeted. Once the availability of funds for new works is ensured, the work should be started by issuing tender notices and commissioning orders, and the funds should be distributed as needed. The old works should be reviewed and completed on priority and the funds should not be provided to the Public Works Department in the form of deposit construction.
The Department concerned shall ensure receipt of funds from the Central Government in respect of the Centrally Sponsored Scheme from the Finance Branch of the Finance Department on receipt (no need to refer the funds to the Expenditure/ Budget Branch) and thereafter, if the funds have been received, the administrative department shall disburse the same to the State Government at their level. There is no need to refer the fee separately to the Finance Department for concurrence. However, if the funds of the Central Government for the previous year are to be spent in the current year, it will be mandatory to obtain the consent of the Planning, Tribal Development Department and Social Justice and Special Assistance Department as well as the Finance Department, as the case may be.

It is also pointed out that under the self-registration accounts, the departments are found to be having huge funds lying unutilized. If the funds are not spent within the stipulated time, they should be returned to the government.
