This period is less than five years. However, Ms. Shivgunde's experience certificate is signed on the photocopy of the attendance sheet of the school children available and the T.C. of the same students after 6th, 7th or 10th standard. The documents show that Ms. Shivgunde was in office during 1995-96 and 1996-97.
Also, as per Rule 8 of the Maharashtra Private School Employees (Conditions of Service) Rules, 1981, the proposal for approval of the appointment made in the approved management should be submitted by the institution management within 15 days. In this case, the management of the institution does not appear to have approved the appointment of Ms. Shivgunde and Ms. Shivgunde has admitted to this in her disclosure.
In view of the above, the Maharashtra Public Service Commission has taken up the matter with respect to the issues raised by the Commission in respect of" Recognized Primary/ Secondary/ Higher Secondary/ Teachers School/ College/ Arts/ Commerce/ Science without considering the issue of pay scale for experience criteria."

However, Ms. Shivgunde, in her disclosure, has stated that she has applied for the post as there is no mention of taking personal approval in the prospectus given along with the application by the Maharashtra Public Service Commission.
The disclosure made by Ms. Shivgunde is contrary to the facts.
7. Considering all the above points, Ms. Shivgunde, in her disclosure, said that her experience is post-B.Ed. Also, the B.Ed degree examination has been awarded first class, it has been requested to take note of it. However, the request of Ms. Shivgunde cannot be considered. This is because the Maharashtra Public Service Commission in its letter dated 4.12.2013 to Smt. Shivgunde had clarified that the experience certificate in the prescribed format as well as the certificate issued by the prescribed authority that the school and their appointment is approved is required to be submitted. Smt. Shivgunde has not raised any objection to the letter dated 04.12.2013 of the Maharashtra Public Service Commission and has not appealed against the same in any court of law.
