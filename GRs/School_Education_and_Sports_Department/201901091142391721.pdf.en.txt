As per the Government decision dated 15th October, 1996, dated 1st October, 1996, in order to be eligible for this scholarship, the candidates must have passed the Secondary School Leaving Certificate (SSLC) examination. The marks of 10th standard students have been increased to 50% and the scholarship amount of the scheme has been increased to 3200. A total of 3200 students will be benefited. The students with the highest marks will be selected for the scholarship. The annual income limit of the parents to avail the benefit of this scheme is Rs. At present, the income limit is very low, due to which many students are deprived of the benefit of scholarship despite being eligible for the scholarship.
