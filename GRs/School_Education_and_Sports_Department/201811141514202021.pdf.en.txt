As per the instructions of the Finance Department, the Treasury Office has refused to accept payment through the prevailing" off-line" method. Therefore, there has been difficulty in paying the salaries and allowances of the employees of Group-C and Group-D cadres in the office of the Education Officer (Continuing Education) working on deputation/ transfer to the Zilla Parishad.
4 At present, in the Panchayat Raj Service System of the Department of Rural Development, in the District Council.
There is no provision for payment of salary to the employees of this department. Also, there is no technical facility at present to transfer posts from the service system to the Panchayat Raj service system. Since the two systems of service and Panchayat Raj Service are completely different, there will be many technical difficulties in making payments regarding salary and allowances of the transferred/ promoted employees as well as deduction of DCPS and other related amounts from their salary. Therefore, the process of providing subsidy on the salary of Education Officer (Continuous), Zilla Parishad, Group-A and Group-B officers in all offices and preparing payments in service and collecting it from the district treasury is done. Similarly, the government was considering to approve the withdrawal of payment from the service system in respect of salary and allowances of the employees working on deputation (promoted/ transferred) in the Zila Parishad.
GOVERNMENT ORDER: The process of providing grants in respect of the salaries of Group-A and Group-B officers in the office of the Education Officer (Continuing Education) in all the Zilla Parishads of the State and preparing payments in service and collecting from the District Treasury is carried out. Similarly, the Zila Parishad is also being authorized to draw payments from the service system in respect of salaries and allowances of all Group C and Group D cadre (promoted/ transferred) employees working on deputation in this department.
The present Government Order is being issued with the approval of the Rural Development Department and the Finance Department. Informal Reference to Finance Department No. 17/ Kosh-4 dated 21-06-2018.
