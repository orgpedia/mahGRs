Introduction: The context. As per the Government Decision dated 05.12.2016, the Institute is governed by the Maharashtra Institute of Commerce Education (Recognition and Conduct of Courses in Typewriting, Short Writing and Computer Typewriting) Regulations, 1991 as amended in 2016.
Government recognized typewriting and computer institutes are working in the land owned by them or in the land leased by some organizations on lease. Proposals for relocation of the said institutions due to local difficulties or other reasons are submitted to the office of the Deputy Director of Divisional Education.
In such a situation, there is no provision in the rules regarding the transfer of the institution, which creates administrative difficulties in the process.
This regulation needs to be amended from time to time and some new things have to be added. The Government was contemplating to make provisions for transfer/ shifting of institutions, change in the distance condition for starting new institutions at present, increase in the processing fee, registration fee, annual registration fee for starting new institutions, obtaining approval, etc., and accordingly, to include a new provision in the Rules for allowing relocation of commercial institutions subject to certain terms and conditions.
Government's decision:
The Government is approving the amended Rules, 2022 of the Maharashtra Institute of Commerce Education (Courses in Typewriting, Short Writing and Computer Typewriting) Recognition and Conduct of Business Rules, 1991.
The Commissioner, Maharashtra State Council of Examination, Pune should print adequate copies of the said" Revised Manual, 2022."
