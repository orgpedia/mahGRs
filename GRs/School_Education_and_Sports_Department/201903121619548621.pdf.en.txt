Introduction: Devchand College, Arjun Nagar, District Kolhapur, has been providing EBC concession to the students studying in the border areas of the school since 1964-65 as a special case considering their academic difficulties. As per the earlier terms and conditions of the aforesaid Government Decision dated 30th March, 1993 and Government Letter dated 5th March, 1965, the EBC concession was granted to the students of the said institution on the income of their parents in Maharashtra till the year 2017-18. Now, a proposal for administrative approval of the disbursement of funds by sanctioning EBC concession for the next year 2018-19 was under consideration of the Government.
Government Decision: As the Maharashtra-Karnataka border dispute is still not resolved, the EBC concession to the students of Devchand College run by Janata Shikshan Mandal, Arjun Nagar, District Kolhapur, must continue as a special matter. Therefore, the Government is permitting the continuation of EBC concession to the students of these colleges and schools for the year 2018-19. Also, the total amount of EBC rebate for the year 2018-19 is Rs. Administrative sanction is being accorded for an amount of Rs.1,78,964/-. The same terms and conditions will apply for 2018-19.
