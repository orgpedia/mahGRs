Date: July 31, 2019
GOVERNMENT DECISION, DEPARTMENT OF SCHOOL EDUCATION AND SPORTS, NO. ISAISHA-2003/ Q.No.80/ MASHI-7, dated 26.06.2003 Preamble: The post of Commandant in Military School is to be filled up by a retired Lieutenant Colonel/ Colonel or a retired officer of that rank in the Army. However, if these officers are not available, orders have been issued under the relevant government decision regarding the filling up of officers of the rank of Major. The maximum age limit for this post is 55 years. However, a retired army officer within the prescribed age limit is not generally available for this post. Alternatively, the post remains vacant from the military schools. Since this post is the head of the military school, it is not suitable to remain vacant.
The age of a retired Lieutenant Colonel/ Colonel or similar retired officer is generally above 55 years. The employee must be employed for at least 4-5 years. Therefore, the government was considering increasing the maximum age limit for appointment to the post of Commandant in the Military School and increasing the retirement age of this post.
Government Decision: It is approved to increase the maximum age limit for appointment to the post of Commandant in the Military School to 57 years for retired officers of the Army, officers of the rank of Lieutenant Colonel/ Colonel or similar rank or if these officers are not available, officers of the rank of Major.
The government is also approving the retirement age of 62 years for the post of Commandant.
(2) This order shall take effect immediately.
