Introduction: Primary education is an important foundation of a student's life. At a young age, children are ready to learn many languages. In order to familiarize the children with the English language from primary school and to reduce the burden of the school children, the government had proposed a scheme of integrated and bilingual textbooks for the learning process at the school level.
The content of the textbook is very useful to the students in the process of learning from the mother tongue. All languages and languages are different and unique. Many English words are often used in the daily routine of students studying mathematics and science. Like while talking to others, while communicating, we often use English words instead of Marathi words. Maths and Science are taught in English at the primary level and at the secondary level. The study reports, researches and references in these subjects are presented in English language. These subjects must be studied in English at the national and international level. At the primary level, students who study mainly in Marathi medium have to learn various concepts in mathematics and science from Marathi. Therefore, if the students understand the meaning of mathematical and scientific concepts in English and the teacher explains a little about it while teaching, then the study of the students will be easy. The decision to bilingualize the primary level textbooks from this stream of thought was proposed at the government level. In this regard, the Government has decided to provide" Integrated and Bilingual Education" in all the schools of the State in a phased manner from Class I. Keeping this in mind, the administration was considering providing integrated and bilingual textbooks in all the schools of the state in a phased manner.
The government has decided to approve integrated and bilingual textbooks in Marathi and Urdu medium and semi-English textbooks in all primary schools in the state from the academic year 2022-23 in a phased manner. This should be implemented as follows:
