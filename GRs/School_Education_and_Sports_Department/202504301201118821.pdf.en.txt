2) Government Letter Serial No. 13.12.2024 3) Letter from the Director of Education (Primary), Maharashtra State, Pune No. 601/1552/2025, d. 18.03.2025.
The Proposal: -
The Supreme Court in Writ Petition No. 1322/2016 As per the instructions given in this case, Reference No. 1 here. Under the Government Decision of 08.10.2024, it has been decided to adjust the regular service of special teachers working on contract basis. It has also been approved to reserve a total of 4860 posts at the Zilla Parishad Central level, one each. Reference No. The Government of India has decided to regularize the services of a total of 2984 Special Teachers working on contract basis in Samagra Shiksha-Inclusive Education Initiatives, Disabled Inclusive Education Scheme (Secondary Level) and Disabled Integrity Education Scheme subject to verification of their qualifications.
The process of verification of eligibility of all candidates under the proposal has been completed. However, some of the 2984 special teachers working under the above mentioned activities are working at the centres under City Resource Centres in the Municipal Corporations. Subject: Ma. The 4860 posts reserved for regularisation of GAT of contractual special teachers as directed by the Supreme Court are at the central level of the Zilla Parishad and alternatively under the Rural Development Department. A total of 4860 special teachers, one each, are expected to be appointed at these 4860 centres. However, since special educators working under Municipal Corporations as mentioned above are covered under the above mentioned activities, it is only appropriate to approve regularization of their services as they are doing teaching work for students with disabilities like other teachers in rural areas involved in this activity. It was decided to adjust the special teachers by maintaining the provision for the differently-abled students studying in the institutions under the Municipal Corporations. The Cabinet has taken cognizance.
The fact that some special teachers are working under the municipal corporation but have a Zilla Parishad centre-level post reserved for them has created some confusion regarding their adjustment. A proposal to take an appropriate decision in this regard was under the consideration of the government.

The Government's Decisions:
The Special Teachers working under the Municipal Corporation are being approved for deployment of their services under the existing Municipal Corporation by amalgamating them into a convenient but vacant centre within the same Taluka / District out of 4860 centres subject to the following conditions.
Out of the 4860 centres, the responsibility of education of students with disabilities in the schools falling under the vacant centres where appointments have been made by adjustment should be devolved to the special teachers who have been adjusted at the nearest centre.
The function of the Special Teachers deployed at the Centre under the Municipal Corporation shall be controlled by officers subordinate to the Commissioner of the concerned Municipal Corporation as before and the Special Teachers appointed accordingly in coordination with the respective Head of the Centre.
Special teachers deployed in service under the corporation should be paid at the same rate as other Adjusted Special Teachers at the central level appointed by the pay adjustment.
Proceedings of Adjustment of Special Teachers under Municipal Corporations by the respective Municipal Corporations.
It should be completed by the CEO of the respective Zilla Parishad in coordination with the Commissioner.
Special teachers under the offices of the Deputy Director of Zonal Education, Mumbai and Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai, which are not Zila Parishads, shall be accommodated at the vacant centre in the taluk under the Zila Parishad of the adjoining Raigad district and their services shall be deployed at the centre where they are presently functioning. For this, the concerned responsible officers should take necessary action in coordination with the CEO of Raigad Zilla Parishad.
The fact is that the number of Zilla Parishad centres in any district is as much as the number of special teachers that can be accommodated in that district. This number includes the special teachers with both the establishments currently under the Zilla Parishad centre and the municipal corporation, if any, in the district.
The number of special educators employed by both establishments in a district may be more than the number of centres in that district. This may result in the addition of some special educators. The superiority of a particular teacher should be taken into account as on the date of joining the service to determine the excess. The special educator who is the highest-serving junior will be the first to be added. If the additional teacher is working under the municipal corporation, it is impractical to adjust his service in another district and apply it to the municipal corporation's subordinate center where he is working. For example, special educators under the municipal corporation should not be made redundant even if the service is junior.
The Director of Education (Primary) shall take care of the adjustment of special teachers working under the corporation and the application of their services in each corporation as aforesaid.
A temporary arrangement is to adjust the services of the special teachers working under the corporation to the post of Zilla Parishad center level and actually deploy their services at the center under the corporation as before. The Urban Development Department, Mantralaya, Mumbai will be required to create the required number of posts in the required number of Libakars at the earliest for the adjustment of special teachers under various Municipal Corporations.
