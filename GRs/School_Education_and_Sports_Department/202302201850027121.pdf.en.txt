Also, detailed information should be collected about the utilization of the grants distributed by the government to these institutions and where the unutilized amount is kept. If the unaccounted money is kept in the bank, then its bank account statement should be submitted to the government. If the funds made available for expenditure on a programme are unutilized, the funds should not be released for the same purpose in the current year without the approval of the Finance Department.
