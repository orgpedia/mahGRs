Introduction:
The Government of Maharashtra vide its GR referred to above has granted approval to
the implementation of the centrally sponsored World Bank-supported STARS (Strengthening
Teaching- Learning and Results for States) project for a period of five years from 2020-21 to
2024-25. The total amount approved for this project is Rs. 976.39 Crore, which will be funded in
the ratio of 60:40 by the Center and State respectively. The 5 main components of this project
are -
1. Strengthening Early Childhood Education & Foundational Learning
2. Improving Learning Assessment Systems
3. Strengthening Classroom Instruction and Remediation through Teacher Development
and School Leadership
4. Governance and Decentralized Management for Improved Service Delivery
5. School to work/ higher education transition
The central government has instructed the state to set up a PMU so that planning and
implementation can start immediately. The state is expected to submit various documents and
reports such as a checklist provided by World Bank, Annual Work Plan & Budget (AWP&B),
proposals for funding, data regarding various components such as training under ECE,
assessments, teachers' training, and so on. This requires timely coordination as well as drafting
of proposals and submission of reports.
Many organizations have shown their willingness to support the state government in
setting up the PMU from their own resources without creating financial burden for the state. The
state government has decided to set up a PMU with the support of willing and competent NGOs
and non-state partners.
