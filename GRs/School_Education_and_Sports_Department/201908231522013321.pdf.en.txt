However, it has come to the notice of the government that there are difficulties in the appointment of sports guides if action is to be taken according to this procedure. Therefore, the matter of issuing revised rules by superseding the rules published as per the Government decision dated December 09, 2010 was under the consideration of the Government.
Government's decision:
Considering the very important role of sports mentors in producing medal winning athletes for Olympics and other similar international sports events from the budding sportspersons of the state, the government is giving approval to fill up 110 posts of sports mentors through outsourcing out of the 153 posts of mentors created on the establishment of Directorate of Sports and Youth Services. For this, the government is giving approval to the amended rules in the accompanying' Annexure-A'.
