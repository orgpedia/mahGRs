In sports, only one third place is given in international competition, while in the same sports, two third places are given at the state and national level. Therefore, in some team sports, players who are given third place in the group are eligible for 5 percent reservation, while in some team sports, players who are not given third place in the group are not eligible for reservation. The government has also found that at present, some national and state sports federations are taking steps to share/ divide the third position at their level only to get the benefit of sportspersons reservation. This is unfair to the candidates who compete for jobs from the sportsperson reservation by excelling in individual sports. Therefore, a clear decision was under consideration of the government to allow the benefits of reservation to the players of the team who are being divided into third places in the organized sports competitions.
GOVERNMENT DECISIONS: The Government has decided to take action as per the following instructions in respect of verification of certificates of third rank holders in the sports disciplines in which third rank is awarded by division/ common category.
Apart from this provision, the benefits of 5 percent reservation should not be allowed to the third-placed candidates declared by other sports organizations.
(2) This provision shall apply to all international, national and state-level sports competitions that take place after the issuance of this Government Decision.
3.Take immediate action to bring the above directions of the Government to the notice of all the concerned sports associations.
