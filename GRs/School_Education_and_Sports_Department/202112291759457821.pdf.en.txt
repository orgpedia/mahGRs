Department of School Education and Sports, Government Resolution No. 230/ SD-4, dated December 24, 2020.
The Proposal:
The two most important women in Indian history are Rajmata Jijau and Krantijyoti Savitribai Phule. Rajmata Jijau was the one who played an important role in the formation of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and thereby creating Swarajya and instilling the spirit of self-respect, self-respect and bravery in all the people. Jijau's overall personality was as influential as that of a' mother' as she was also as a capable, self-reliant, self-respecting, self-confident, versatile' woman' with impeccable political judgement, social sense, feminine yearning and good administrative sense. If today's girls emulate these holistic qualities of Jijau, then definitely an ideal of women empowerment will be created in the society.
Krantijyoti Savitribai Phule is credited with giving wings to the educational leap that Indian women have taken today. Today's women are brimming with knowledge because they have shown the courage to start women's education in a very adverse situation and in a working society and to face the temptation of anti-social elements.
Taking the example of the achievements and personality of the great women Jijau and Savitri, today's girls will definitely help in building an empowered, self-reliant and courageous society. Therefore, it is necessary for the girl students from the school level to have a holistic understanding of the thoughts and works of Rajmata Jijau and Krantijyoti Savitribai Phule. This is not just a thought, but the path from Jijau to Savitri is the path of women's respect.
