Government order
Based on the final result of the State Service (Main) Examination-2016, the Maharashtra Public Service Commission (MPSC) has recommended the candidates for the post of Group B.
The Government vide its decision dated 14th January, 2019 has created 3 supernumerary posts for 3 candidates undergoing training in Combined Peripheral Training Programme-IVA for which one year extension has been granted for joining the training of CPTP-IV. One of the candidates has been relieved on 30th September, 2019 (MP) to join the other post and training of other 2 candidates is in progress.
Since the process of preparing the cadre strength of the probationary officers is going on in Vanamati and Yashoda Training Institute, it is likely to take some time to prepare the provisional cadre strength of the Group-B trainee probationary officers in CPTP-4A and the process of allocation of the divisional cadre.
