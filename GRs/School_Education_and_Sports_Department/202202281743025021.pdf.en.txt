As per the New Education Policy 2020, the State School Standards Authority (SSSA) is required to be created at the state level. The Central Government has sanctioned provision under STARS project for these matters. As per the New Education Policy 2020, the process of determining academic standards is under the jurisdiction of the State Council of Educational Research and Training, Maharashtra.
