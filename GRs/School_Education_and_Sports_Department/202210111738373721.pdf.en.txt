However, henceforth, the departments should not draw funds under the head of accounts without the consent of the Finance Department unless they submit the head under which the old detailed payments are pending.
20) The departments should note that it is a kind of irregularity that the funds that have remained unutilized for various reasons are technically shown as spent by the departments by transferring them to their subordinate corporation. Provisions shall not be drawn or disbursed unless the previous unutilized funds under them (kept outside the purview of their own provident fund account/ corporation account or otherwise showing expenditure) have been fully spent. It is also pointed out that under the self-registration accounts, the departments are found to be having huge funds lying unutilized. If the funds are not spent within the stipulated time, they should be returned to the government. If the unaccounted money is kept in the bank, its bank account statement should be submitted to the government.
21) In the case of expenditure for making outstanding payments, the funds shall not be withdrawn unless it is satisfied that the material purchased has been physically received and its accounts maintained properly.
3. The Government have decided to amend Rule 17 and Rule 142 of the Budget Rule Book and Sub-section (1) of the Financial Powers Rule Book, 1978. 43/ Finance-3, dated 04.04.2022 and letter No. Informal Reference No.43/ Finance-3, dated 05.04.2022, of Finance Department for Roll No.1 204/2021/ Expenditure-9, dated 27th May, 2021, for serial numbers 2 and 3 vide Finance Department's Informal Reference No. 965/ Expenditure-5, dated 06.10.2022 and for Roll No.8, the Informal Reference No. 800/- (Rupees Fourteen only), being issued pursuant to approval dated 13th September, 2022.
