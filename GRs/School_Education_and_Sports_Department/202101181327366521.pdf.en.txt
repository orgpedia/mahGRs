However, some of the junior colleges are still continuing to teach the subjects as per the old subject scheme without taking cognizance of the above changes. The Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE) has released the admit cards for the Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) examination 2021. Therefore, the junior colleges which have continued the subjects as per the old subject scheme are facing difficulties in the selection of subjects while filling the examination applications, so it is not possible to fill the examination applications. Considering these aspects, the matter of amending the relevant government decision was under consideration of the government.
Government's decision:
Keeping in view the academic interest of the students, the following steps should be taken for the regular examination of the year 2021 so that the academic year of the students who have chosen the subjects according to the previous subject scheme is not wasted:
The students who have taken the closed subjects of Avesta-Pahlavi, General Knowledge (for Military Schools), Hindi Applied, Marathi Literature, English Literature, Stenography (English/ Marathi) under Occupational Orientation will be given a Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) of the subject. The only and final opportunity to take the exam should be given for the regular exam of 2021. However, if the student does not pass in this exam or in some subject, then those students will be able to enter the exam with the same subject as per the previous subject scheme.
