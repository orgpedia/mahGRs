Also, detailed information should be collected about the utilization of the grants distributed by the government to these institutions and where the unutilized amount is kept. If the unaccounted money is kept in the bank, then its bank account statement should be submitted to the government. If the funds made available for expenditure on a programme are unutilized, the funds should not be released for the same purpose in the current year without the approval of the Finance Department.
14. While drawing payments to beneficiaries under the individual beneficiary programme, grants to individual beneficiaries shall not be drawn unless the list of beneficiaries is fixed and linked to the payment with proper details. The programmes of individual beneficiaries should be linked with Aadhaar number and the subsidy should be disbursed through Electronic Clearance System (ECS) only. Further, the concerned departments should ensure that the measures to be taken to reach the individual benefit schemes to the eligible beneficiaries are taken as mentioned in the Government Decision No. SANKRIYA-2022/ PR No. 27/ Finance Force, dated 08.06.2022 of the Finance Department.
