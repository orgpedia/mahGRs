The Proposal:
In reference to the above No. Under the Government decisions from 1st to 3rd November 2020, 20% subsidy has been sanctioned to private primary, secondary and higher secondary schools/ batches which have been approved on permanent non-grant basis and excluding permanent words (except English medium). Since the teachers and non-teaching staff of these schools have not been given IDs, their salaries for the month of February 2021 can be paid offline. The decision was approved by the government. At present, due to the increase in corona infection, the office attendance has been reduced, so it will take some time for these teachers and non-teaching staff to get school marks. Therefore, the matter of approving the payment of salaries of these teachers and non-teaching staff till June 2021 through offline mode was under consideration of the government.
