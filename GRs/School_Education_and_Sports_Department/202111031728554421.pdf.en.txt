Government Circular: Under the Advanced Education Maharashtra program, the movement of tech-friendly teachers and digital schools has emerged in a big way in the state. With the help of tech-friendly teachers, the information of all schools, teachers and students has been filled on the Saral system in the state. The Government of India has developed the PGI (Performance Grading Index). In this, the state has developed a simple system based on the information of the students and teachers of the schools, providing a simple system-based facility to register the attendance of students and teachers in the schools of the state.
Accordingly, the MahaStudent app has been developed by the department. The app is available on Google Play Store. The app provides a facility for teachers to record the attendance of students digitally. Based on this, the teacher will be able to register the absence of students in his class with a few clicks. Attendance of all the teachers of the school will also be recorded. With this app, teachers will not have to keep the attendance sheet of the students separately. Also, separate information of the students under the mid-day meal scheme should be filled.
The two applications will be combined to make it unnecessary. This will help to know the attendance of students and teachers at the state, district, taluka and central level in one click.
However, it is being approved to fill the attendance of all students and teachers in the state digitally through the MahaStudent App.
