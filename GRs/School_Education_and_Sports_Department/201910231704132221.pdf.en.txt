10) The salary subsidy given by the government will have to be transferred to the bank account of the beneficiaries through ECS. Under no circumstances should the salary subsidy amount be disbursed in lump sum and offline mode.
11) Before disbursing the grants to the local self-government institutions and corporations, the amount coming to the state government from these institutions should be reviewed and the remaining grants should be disbursed only after recovering those amounts. Also, detailed information should be collected about the utilization of the grants distributed by the government to these institutions and where the unutilized amount is kept. If the unaccounted money is kept in the bank, then its bank account statement should be submitted to the government.

12. While drawing the payments of beneficiaries under the individual beneficiary programme, the grants of individual beneficiaries shall not be drawn unless the list of beneficiaries is fixed and linked with the payment with proper details.

The old works should be reviewed and completed on priority and the funds should not be provided to the Public Works Department in the form of deposit construction.
The Department concerned shall ensure receipt of funds from the Central Government in respect of the Centrally Sponsored Scheme from the Finance Branch of the Finance Department on receipt (no need to refer the funds to the Expenditure/ Budget Branch) and thereafter, if the funds have been received, the administrative department shall disburse the same to the State Government at their level.
