Preamble: The conditions to be considered while approving transfers from unaided schools to partially/ fully aided schools and the manner in which the salary to be paid to such teachers after such transfers and the provisions therefor have been mentioned in the Government Circular dated 28.6.2016. However, the Government is not satisfied with the provisions of the circular dated 28.6.2016 raising the issue of inconsistency with the provisions of Rule-41 of the Maharashtra Private Schools Employees (Conditions of Service) Rules, 1981. The High Court of Judicature at Mumbai, vide Writ Petition No. Other petitions were filed including 5313/2017.
In the Government Circular dated 28.6.2016 regarding transfers from non-aided schools to partially/ fully aided schools, in point (5) (a) and (5) (b) of paragraph 3, it has been provided for taking options in respect of salary of teachers before transfer. Point 5 (a) provides for taking the option of willing to work on remuneration as a teaching servant for 3 years if the period of appointment of a teacher on non-subsidised basis is less than 5 years and such teacher is to be replaced on subsidised basis. It is clear that the provisions of point 5 (a) and point 5 (b) are inconsistent with the provisions relating to the remuneration of employees to be transferred to sub rule 3 of rule 41 of the Maharashtra Private Schools Employees (Conditions of Service) Rules, 1981.
Petition No. 5313/2017 along with other petitions. In view of the order dated 25.4.2019 passed by the High Court, Bombay and the aforesaid, the Government was contemplating to amend Rule 41 of the Maharashtra Private Schools Staff (Conditions of Service) Rules, 1981 regarding transfers from unaided to partially/ fully aided schools.

GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: SRIKH- 2019/ PR No. 341/ TNT-1
Accordingly, a notification dated 8.6.2020 has been issued for transfer of vacant posts in the teaching cadre from unaided or partially aided schools/ batches to partially aided or fully aided schools/ batches respectively, only on the basis of merit of service and considering the requirement of the subject and subject to other conditions. In this notification, it has been provided that the salary of the teachers transferred under Rule 41 (1) (3) will be admissible as per the government will determine from time to time.
Accordingly, the matter of fixation of pay and issuance of instructions to bring the provisions of the notification to the notice of all concerned by cancelling the Government Circular dated 28.6.2016 was under consideration of the Government.
Government Decision: Rule 41 of the Maharashtra Private Schools Staff (Conditions of Service) Rules, 1981 provides for the transfer of teaching staff working in private unaided or partially aided schools/ batches in the state to the vacant posts in partially aided or fully aided schools/ batches respectively, as per the Government Notification dated 8.6.2020. In pursuance of the said provisions, the following instructions are being issued: 1. Instances have been noticed of transfer of such vacancies from non-aided or partially aided schools/ batches without adjusting the additional teachers, even though additional teachers are available for appointment by adjustment as per the requirement of the subject. This increases the burden on the government. The salaries of additional teachers are paid from the Public Trust Fund. Therefore, the government has given priority to their adjustment. Therefore, before making such transfers, the concerned Management and Education Officer/ Divisional Deputy Director of Education shall ensure that no additional teachers are available in accordance with the provision of Section 5 (1) of the Maharashtra Private Schools Employees (Conditions of Service) Act, 1977. The management should not transfer any employee to a vacant post if additional staff is available.
Different types of schools/ batches of the same management, for example, fully aided, partially aided, unaided and self-financed are functioning under the School Education Department. The government is not providing any financial assistance to these schools. The managements should not transfer the staff of self-financing schools to unaided/ partially aided/ aided schools/ batches as they will not get grants in future also.
The cadre of staff working in self-financing schools/ batches should be kept separate.

Before such transfer, the employee should have completed at least 5 years of service in an unaided/ partially aided school or batch of the said management.
4. Transfer of teachers working in primary/ upper primary/ secondary/ higher secondary schools to unequal positions increases the financial burden on the government if the pay scale is increased, and if the pay scale is reduced, it is unfair to the teacher concerned. Therefore, no transfer should be made from primary to upper primary, upper primary to secondary, secondary to higher secondary, higher secondary to teacher's college or vice versa.
5. Only the best of the available staff may be transferred in such a manner keeping in view the requirement of the subject matter of the vacancy.
6. Such transfer can be made only on vacant post.
7. Before such transfer, the appointment of the said teacher should have been approved by the Education Officer or the Deputy Director of Divisional Education, as the case may be. Thus, only those teachers from the unaided/ partially aided schools/ batches who have been given individual recognition should be considered eligible for transfer.
After the transfer, the Deputy Director of Divisional Education or the Education Officer, as the case may be, shall replace the
The re-appointment will require personal approval. The management shall ensure compliance of all necessary rules and conditions.
Salary will not be admissible at the place of transfer without personal approval.
As per Rule 41 (1) (3) of the Maharashtra Private Schools Employees (Conditions of Service) Rules, 1981, it is provided that the salary subsidy shall be payable to the employee so transferred, as may be determined by the Government from time to time. Accordingly, the salary admissible to an employee so transferred to a subsidized or partially subsidized school/ batch shall be paid by the management as per his regular salary. However, the government has decided that the salary subsidy will be paid by the government according to the stage in which the school/ batch is in the grant. For example, for 20% aided schools/ batches, 20% of the allowable salary as per the regular salary of the concerned employee will be paid as subsidy by the government and the remaining 80% will be paid by the management.
