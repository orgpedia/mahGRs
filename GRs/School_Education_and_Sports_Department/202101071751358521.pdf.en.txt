Preamble: In order to streamline the online admission process for Class 11th from the academic year 2020-2021, the Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has decided to conduct online admission test for Class 11th. The Government decision has been issued on 23.06.2020.
The admission process for the year 2020-21 has been started from the month of July 2020 due to the extraordinary situation arising out of the outbreak of COVID-19.
The admission process for the year 2020-21 is underway and has been delayed this year due to the COVID-19 situation.
The first-come-first-serve (FCFS) round was cancelled as per the decision of the government in the context and the process of additional special rounds was to be adopted instead. However, at the end of the special round, it has been observed that there is a delay rather than an increase in the rate of admission and many students are still left without admission.
In view of this, the Government was considering to conduct the First Come First Served (FCFS) round instead of the regular rounds in the last phase of admission process for this year's Class XI admission process.
The decision has been taken by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), Amravati Municipal Corporation (AMC), Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) and Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC).
