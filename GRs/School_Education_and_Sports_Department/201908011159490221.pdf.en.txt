The proposal has been approved by the government. The funds are then sent to the state board through the director of education, secondary and higher secondary. and then through the State Board

GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: SAMRICH 2019/ Q. NO. 47/ SD-5
The method of declaration of drought/ scarcity affected villages by the Revenue and Forest Department and related decisions are issued from September to May. The application process for the Class 10 and Class 12 exams will begin in the month of October. Since often drought/ scarcity affected villages are declared late, it takes a long time for students to get reimbursement of examination fees. Accordingly, the department was receiving suggestions to change the existing procedure.
Government's decision:
Considering the suggestions received by the Department, the procedure for reimbursement/ waiver of examination fee for the students of classes 10th and 12th in drought/ scarcity affected areas is being revised as follows:
The state board should take the information of the revenue board, village, taluka and district of the students, as well as the bank account of the students/ parents while filling the form of class 10 and 12 examination.
The amount of examination fee to be reimbursed/ waived off to the students will include the cost of examination fee, marksheet fee, merit certificate fee, etc.
The State Board should ensure that the students who have been declared as drought-hit villages before filling the forms of the students after the Revenue Department declared the list of drought-hit villages should not have to pay any fee while filling the forms.
The State Board should submit a proposal to the Director of Education by the end of November for reimbursement of examination fees of students who have not been charged by the State Board due to being in drought-affected areas, so that the reimbursement amount can be paid to the State Board by March 31.
After the students fill the form, the information of the students of the villages which will be declared as drought by the Revenue Department should be given to the Director of Education, Secondary and Higher Secondary through the Board from the computer system of the State Board after every government decision in this regard by the Revenue Department.
The reimbursement of the amount of examination fee charged by the Director of Education from the students by the State Government should be deposited in the bank account of the students/ parents through RTGS.
All necessary arrangements should be made by the Director of Education, Secondary and Higher Secondary. Also, it should be completely online.
