GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: ANUV 4922/ (33/22)/ BUDGET 12) The wage subsidy provided by the Government shall be mandatorily credited to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries through ECS. Under no circumstances should the salary subsidy amount be disbursed in lump sum and offline mode.
13) Before disbursing grants to local self-government institutions and corporations, the amount coming to the state government from these institutions should be reviewed and the remaining grants should be disbursed only after recovering those amounts. Also, detailed information should be collected about the utilization of the grants distributed by the government to these institutions and where the unutilized amount is kept. If the unaccounted money is kept in the bank, then its bank account statement should be submitted to the government. If the funds made available for expenditure on a programme are unutilized, the funds should not be released for the same purpose in the current year without the approval of the Finance Department.
14. While drawing payments to beneficiaries under the individual beneficiary programme, grants to individual beneficiaries shall not be drawn unless the list of beneficiaries is fixed and linked to the payment with proper details.
