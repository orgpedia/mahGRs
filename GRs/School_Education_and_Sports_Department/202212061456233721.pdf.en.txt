The Committee is expected to prepare a draft of the revised policy after considering the following points: a. The Committee should visit the Military Schools in the State and take stock of the current situation. Also, make suggestions on what needs to be improved.
The current policy is about 28 years old and we should think about how the policy will remain relevant.
The Government of India has implemented a policy to start 100 new Sainik Schools in the country on Public Private Partnership (PPP) basis. This policy should be reviewed while formulating the revised policy of the state.
Steps should be taken to ensure that maximum number of students from Sainik Schools in the State get admission in NDA.
(e) Suggestions as to whether or how the existing curriculum in the Military School needs to be changed.
(e) such other matters as may be prescribed by the Chairman and members of the Committee.
