The proposal-
The state government has decided to give 20 per cent seats to candidates who have passed Class 12 qualification and Diploma in Teacher Education (D.Ed) qualification in English medium in the recruitment of primary teachers in primary schools. 20.06.2008. The recruitment of teaching staff in primary, upper primary, secondary and higher secondary schools declared eligible for private aided, partially aided and subsidized education, including local self-government institutions in the state, will be done through a computer system called' Pavitra" on the basis of aptitude and intelligence tests. The Government has passed the resolution dated 23.06.2017. The recruitment process in these schools is integrated. As per the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, subject-wise teachers are required to be made available for classes 6 to 8 in primary schools. So, since science and mathematics are not subjects for classes 1 to 5, there is no need to provide teachers for English medium. Also, many teachers are now ready to teach English subjects. The district council which needs English medium teachers, the district council can make available English medium teachers in the recruitment process. Therefore, the government was considering to remove this provision as there is no need to reserve 20 percent of the total seats for candidates who qualified in English medium in the teacher recruitment process.
