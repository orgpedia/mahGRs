Introduction: Dakshna Foundation has been conducting free JEE and NEET entrance exams for the last 8 years for the bright and poor students studying in class 12th science stream. Students from all over the country are participating in the event. However, there has been no response from the state government. Very few students from the state come for this activity. Therefore, it is necessary to make information about this initiative available in schools so that the children of the state can take maximum advantage of this initiative. The government was considering making the information available to the students.
