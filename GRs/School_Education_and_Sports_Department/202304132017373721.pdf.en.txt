Preamble: As per the decision of the Government under Reference No. 1, 924 part-time librarians in recognized private aided schools in the State, who meet the prescribed criteria, have been converted into full-time librarians and upgraded to full-time. As per the decision of the Government No. 2 under reference, it was decided to upgrade 596 part-time librarians to full-time librarians from the working part-time librarians in the State. However, as on 28/01/2019, the number criteria for the post of Full-time Librarian has been fixed as 1001 students from class 6th to 12th, as per the figure for non-teaching posts (excluding class IV). Due to the surplus of full-time librarians in the state, it was not possible to upgrade the part-time librarians to full-time librarians.
As per the Government decision dated 28/01/2019, the figure of non-teaching posts (excluding Class IV) in private aided schools in the State has been fixed. As per the above figure, 1 full time post of Librarian has been made admissible in the schools having more than 1001 students from class 6th to 12th. Accordingly, a total of 2118 full-time librarian posts have been sanctioned in the state. Similarly, the post of part-time librarian has been made a dead cadre and the posts will automatically lapse after the present part-time librarian retires/ dies. Also, it was decided that no new recruitment or creation of posts would be made as the cadre of part-time librarian was a dead cadre.

has come. Part-time librarians are accredited employees. The employees working in the post of part-time librarian are not getting other benefits of service like full-time employees, as the post of part-time librarian has become a dead cadre, and in line with the long-standing demand for the promotion of part-time librarians to full-time librarians, they should be converted into full-time librarians.
Babasaheb Ambedkar was frequently attacked by the teachers/ non-teaching staff association. Accordingly, the matter of upgradation (conversion) of 1276 part-time librarians to full-time librarians was under consideration of the Government.
Government's decision:
There are a total of 2118 sanctioned posts of full-time librarians in the state. At present, there are about 926 working posts and about 1192 posts are available for upgradation of part-time librarians. All part-time librarians in the state are to be upgraded to full-time librarians available. At present, there are 280 general schools in the state with a student strength of 2,000 to 3,000, and more than 280 full-time librarians will be able to work on them. There are also 53 schools with a student strength of more than 3000. In this, the work of 106 full-time librarians will be allowed. Thus, a total of 386 full-time librarians (280 and 106 together 386) will be permissible. The posts of full-time librarians available in these schools will be upgraded to 386 part-time full-time librarians initially. After the upgradation of part-time librarians in these posts, the Government is approving the upgradation of the remaining part-time librarians to the posts available after meeting the criterion of 1001 students as per the School Mapping Report by combining two and three schools on the basis of the report received under Reference No. 4 within the limit of 2118 full-time librarians available in the State, subject to the following conditions: 1. The process of upgradation to full-time posts should be carried out according to the seniority of the part-time librarians.
The part-time librarian who is to be upgraded to full-time librarian should have completed at least 5 years of continuous service in the post of part-time librarian.
(3) A person qualified for the post of part-time librarian shall be appointed as part-time librarian as per rules and such part-time librarian as may be approved by the competent authority for such appointment.
4. Part-time Librarian post should be filled as per the reservation policy.
5. The Librarians should be appointed at the minimum salary level of the post of Librarians.
