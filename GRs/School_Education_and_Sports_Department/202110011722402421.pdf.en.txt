The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) will host the Women's Asian Football Championship in India from January 20, 2022 to February 6, 2022. The Women's Asian Football Championship is an international football tournament that is contested by 12 countries from across Asia. That's why this tournament is so important. The competition will be held at international level. Due to the situation created by the Covid-19 pandemic globally, the players of the teams appearing for the tournament will have to travel a minimum. The All India Football Federation and the Asian Football Confederation have decided to hold the tournament at the same venue. The matches will be played at Andheri Sports Complex, Mumbai, DY Patil Stadium, Nerul, Navi Mumbai and Shiv Chhatrapati Sports Complex, Mahlunge-Balewadi, Pune. Each venue needs to have at least three practice grounds and one main ground. """ It is necessary to build infrastructure in Pune, provide security, medical facilities, travel equipment etc. in Pune, Navi Mumbai and Mumbai in connection with this tournament." For this, a high-level committee at the state level and two separate executive committees, one each in Mumbai and Pune, were under the consideration of the government.
Government Decision: The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) will host the Women's Asian Football Championship in India from 20th January 2022 to 6th February 2022. The Government have approved the constitution of the following committees for the organisation and control of the competition:
