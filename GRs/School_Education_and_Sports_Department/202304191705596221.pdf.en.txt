The implementation of this decision regarding the compulsory teaching-learning of the Marathi language began during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This is being seen more strongly in the case of students of other examination boards apart from the state curriculum as the Marathi subject is new to them. Considering all these factors, the government was considering to take an appropriate decision to facilitate the assessment of Marathi language of the students of other examination boards.
The Maharashtra government has decided to extend the registration of students of classes VIII, IX and X for the next three years from 2023-24 in schools of other examination boards in the state, excluding schools of the state curriculum.
