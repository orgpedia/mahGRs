Preface: Bhiwkund, Ta. Construction of Sainik School at Ballarpur, G. Chandrapur is in progress and is scheduled to be completed by June 2019. The state government has sanctioned funds for the construction of the school building. It is proposed to keep certain portions of the school premises open to the general public to generate revenue for maintenance and upkeep of the school. The campus will have facilities of international standards for various indoor and outdoor sports. The theme of the school premises is based on the memories of the Kargil War and includes the Army Museum, NDA Guidance Centre, Parade Ground, etc.
Outdoor sports facilities, swimming pool, auditorium in the school premises can be made available to other institutions, general public and students of other schools for a fee to generate revenue for maintenance and upkeep of the school. Citizens can also visit the Army Museum in the premises of the Sainik School and the various themes/ shows performed therein (for a fee).
If the facilities of Chandpur Sainik School are made available to other institutions and common citizens, the revenue generated from it will be received by the state government. The funds will be used for the maintenance of the school. However, it was under the consideration of the Government to constitute a Committee under the Chairmanship of the Divisional Commissioner, Nagpur, to consider all the aspects of the facilities available in the premises of the said school to other institutions and the general public, how much should be charged for those facilities, how the revenue generated from the provision of such facilities should be utilized, etc. and to make recommendations to the Government.
