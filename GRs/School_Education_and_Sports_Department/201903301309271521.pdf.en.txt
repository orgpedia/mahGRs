A few new features have been added. These include athletics, badminton, hockey, shooting, tennis, weightlifting, wrestling, archery, boxing, football, kabaddi, volleyball and kho-kho. Due to the regular use of the above facilities, the construction work of these sports facilities is affected due to deficiencies, discolouration, various modern sports materials, necessary repair and maintenance of electrical and electronic equipment, expiry of the prescribed period of use of sports facilities and erosion due to continuous use. Similarly, in addition to all the sports facilities of the sports complex, all the necessary arrangements like electric, drainage, water supply, electrical appliances and cleanliness, maintenance and security of the premises etc. and all the necessary measures for this purpose have to be taken.
