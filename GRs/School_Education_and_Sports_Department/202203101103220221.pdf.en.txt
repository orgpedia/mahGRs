Introduction: The United Nations adopted the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1989 to protect the fundamental rights of the child, thereby ensuring that all children have access to basic human rights. Such as the right to life, the right to develop physical and intellectual latent qualities, the right to protection from influences that have a detrimental effect on the development of children, as well as the right to participate in family, cultural and social life. Children's rights are special human rights that apply to all children under the age of 18. All children are equal before the law regardless of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, sexual orientation, gender identity, sexual orientation, gender identity, sexual orientation, gender identity, sexual orientation, gender identity, sexual orientation, gender identity, sexual orientation, gender identity, sexual orientation, etc. The Maharashtra State Commission for Protection of Child Rights was established in July 2007 under the Protection of Child Rights Act, 2005 to protect, promote and defend the rights of children in Maharashtra. However, even before the constitution of the Child Rights Commission, Mahatma Phule, Gyanjyoti Savitribai Phule, Rajarshi Shahu Maharaj, Dr. Maharashtra has inherited the progressive thinking of Babasaheb Ambedkar and many other great social reformers. The great social reformer and pioneer of women's education Gyanjyoti Savitribai Phule and Mahatma Jyotiba Phule recognized the importance of child rights in the pre-independence era and started the era of girls' education. He also rebelled against many untouchable customs such as child marriage, sati, and kesavapana.
The Protection of Child Rights Act is meant to protect the interests/ rights of all children.
At present, the focus is on education, health and safety of girls. Covid-19 has had a huge impact on children's education.
There are fears that the number of out-of-school children will increase due to the migration of parents. Also, child marriage is on the rise. The government was considering the formation of committees at various levels on the occasion of the 125th death anniversary of Gyanjyoti Savitribai Phule to ensure a safe and child-friendly environment for children at home, school and society, as well as their social, emotional and learning.
