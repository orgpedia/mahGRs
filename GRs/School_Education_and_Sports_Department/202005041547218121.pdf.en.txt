Mantralaya, Mumbai 400 032
Date of Birth: April 28, 2020
The Proposal:
Currently, there is a lockdown in place across the country. Situation is different across the world
No. In such a serious situation, due to less traffic, factories being closed, the pollution level has also reduced a lot. In this situation, by interacting with the students, they can be made more aware of the environment. Parents, children, and families are all at home during the lockdown. Is it possible to build a laboratory at home? We can create awareness among children about different household items, kitchen items, their design and function and the science behind these items.
Due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the entire country has been put under a lockdown. All schools in the state are closed. All school exams have been cancelled. Class 10th exams have been cancelled. The lockdown imposed in the state has been extended for the time being. It is important for every student to be in the stream of education during this period of curfew. Children have to learn different ways of learning. It is also necessary to try to remove the fear and anxiety in the minds of children during this period of curfew. You can do some new work with the help of time. In this era of technology, online education is a must. Children can now learn on their own. Currently, the curriculum includes subjects like Marathi, Mathematics, Science, English, Hindi, History and Civics, Geography, Art, Work Experience, Health and Physical Education. The use of technology can be very well used in the overall development of students.

There is a lot of scope to increase the participation of parents in the education of children. Is there anything we can do to help parents understand their children's inclinations, hobbies, attitudes, and attitudes? Could they answer the question? This can also be considered. At present, the teaching-learning activities in schools have been suspended. It's constantly going on. But if this extra-curricular learning can be combined with school studies, education can be made richer, deeper and more understanding. Could we use technology to do that?
If we understand the science behind the spread of the corona (COVID-19) virus, we can see that the virus is widely transmitted by human contact. Therefore, at present, people who meet for compulsory work around the world are working at a distance from each other. The way we greet each other has also changed. Indian culture is being used all over the world. From this point of view, Indian culture has acquired a unique significance in the world. In such a situation, it is the right time to teach the children the importance of Indian culture.
Government circular:
The Government of Maharashtra has already taken measures to make effective use of technology. We can continue our education even during this period by reaching out to all those parents and children. Teachers, parents and students should use different websites, portals, platforms and educational applications for this. Students and parents need to be constantly informed about cyber security while using technology.
At present, the government is making everyone aware of some important resources to continue the learning-teaching process. They need to be used more. For this, the following resources are being made available to implement the concept of learning from home. The concept of learning from home should be implemented by making maximum use of these resources.
DIKSHA: The Central Government (MHRD) and the Government of Maharashtra have launched the DIKSHA e-learning platform to provide free and abundant e-learning materials to every teacher and student.
