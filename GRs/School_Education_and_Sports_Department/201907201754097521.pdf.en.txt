The Proposal:
The provision of school jurisdiction has been made under Section 8 of the Maharashtra Private Schools Employees (Conditions of Service) Regulation Act, 1977. At present, there is no formal mechanism to deal with complaints that do not fall under the jurisdiction of the school tribunal. It has been observed that the number of court cases is increasing as there is no mechanism to act on the complaints of teachers and non-teaching staff of private aided/ partially aided schools. The court also directed the school education department to set up a grievance redressal mechanism. Department of Higher and Technical Education As per the Government decision dated 18.12.2018, a Grievance Redressal Committee has been constituted to deal with the grievances of teachers/ non-teaching staff and officers. On the same lines, the government was considering to form a Grievance Redressal Committee to take action on the complaints of teachers and non-teaching staff of private aided/ partially aided schools recognized under the School Education Department.
Grievance Redressal Committees are being constituted at each Divisional level to deal with the grievances of teachers and non-teaching staff of recognized private aided/ partially aided schools as under:
