Preamble: In order to determine the policy regarding the direct appointment of players in government service and the inclusion of Shivchhatrapati awardee players in government jobs, Ma. The Chief Minister presided over the meeting. The meeting was held on 08.06.2022. The meeting Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports, Shri. Minister of State (Youth Affairs and Sports) The Chief Secretary, Shri.
The meeting was attended by Additional Chief Secretary (General Administration), Additional Chief Secretary (Revenue), Principal Secretary (Finance), Secretary, School Education and Sports Department, Commissioner, Sports and Youth Services.
The decision was taken by the School Education and Sports Department. As per the provision dated 09.12.2010, sportspersons who have qualified in the official international sports event are given direct appointment in the government service. Qualified players are mostly preferred for the post of Deputy Collector, Deputy Superintendent of Police, Superintendent of State Excise, Sales Tax Officer, Group-A.
After being appointed to the post, the players are required to complete training, pass the departmental examination, as per the service entry rules of the post. However, since the players have to go to participate in various international/ national competitions, they cannot complete the required training for the post, nor can they appear for the departmental examination. As a result, they do not complete their term. This raises the question of their pay. Also, the question of salary during the leave period arises as these players have gone to practice for a long time. Since the service admission rules for these posts have been prescribed by the concerned administrative department, it is not appropriate for the Sports Department to take action in this regard.
Therefore, in this meeting, to decide the policy regarding the direct appointment and other service conditions of the players, Ma. The committee will be headed by Additional Chief Secretary (Home), Principal Secretary (Forest), Principal Secretary (Higher and Technical Education), Secretary, School Education and Sports Department, Commissioner, Sports and Youth Services. The Chief Minister said. Accordingly, the government had constituted the committee.
Government Decision: To set a policy regarding direct appointment of players in government service, as well as to accommodate Shivchhatrapati awardee players in government jobs, Ma. the Additional Chief Secretary
