The Proposal:
As per the Government decision dated 01.07.2016, a total of 37 officers have been promoted to the vacant post of Education Officer and similar cadre in the Maharashtra Education Service, Group A (Administration Branch) through direct recruitment and limited departmental examination. The said promotion shall be granted for a period of 11 (eleven) months or till such time as the candidates are available from the Maharashtra Public Service Commission, whichever is earlier. Out of these 37 officers, 11 officers have not joined the post of posting by promotion and 4 officers have retired as per the prescribed age so a total of 20 officers have been demoted to Group-B post vide order dated 04.12.2017. 3 Here the name of Mr. L. M. Dure is included.
However, Mr. L. M. Dure was not given posting as he was suspended at the time of issuing the order.
Shri L.M. Dure, vide order dated 06.10.2018, has been reinstated in Government service in the rank of Group-A Education Officer. On 09.10.2018, Group-B officers were considered for promotion to the post of Education Officer, Group-A. The name of Mr. L. M. Dure was also considered. However, since disciplinary proceedings are in progress against Mr. Dure, the General Administration Department, in accordance with the provisions of the Government Decision dated 15.12.2017 and dated 30.08.2018, decided to exercise his eligibility and initiate disciplinary proceedings against him.

The decision on his promotion has been kept in a sealed cover as the proceedings are underway. Therefore, the matter of cancelling the promotion of Mr. Dure to the post of Group-A Education Officer in absentia and giving him the post of Deputy Education Officer, Group-B was under the consideration of the government. The government has taken the following decisions:
Government's decision:
Vacancies in the quota of promotion of Educational Officers and similar cadre dated 01.07.2016
A total of 37 officers were given promotion on a non-existent basis for 11 months. After expiry of the said period of 11 months, the 20 officers who were promoted and posted as Non-Executive Officers to Group B post vide order dated 04.12.2017.
has been removed. Among these 20 officers, the name of Mr. L. M. Dure is also included at serial number 3. However, Mr. L. M. Dure was not given posting in Group-B post as he was suspended at that time.
Shri L.M. Dure's name was considered in the meeting of the Divisional Promotion Committee dated 09.10.2018 for promotion to the post of Group-A Education Officer. However, as per the provisions of the General Administration Department dated 15.12.2017 and 30.08.2018, Mr. Dure's eligibility has been checked and disciplinary proceedings against him are underway, the decision regarding his promotion has been kept in the envelope. Therefore, Mr. Dure along with other officers have already been posted to Group-B post by terminating the pending promotion to the post of Education Officer. Accordingly, the posting granted vide order dated 06.10.2018 stands terminated and Mr. Dure is now being posted in the post at serial number 5 in the table below in the revised format for the purpose of post demotion to the post of Deputy Education Officer.
