The Maharashtra Self-Financed Schools (Establishment and Regulation) Act, 2012, provides for the establishment of new all-medium primary, upper primary, secondary and higher secondary schools and the recognition of upgradation of existing schools. Schools which meet the criteria prescribed in the proposals submitted by the private educational institutions for the academic year 2019-2020 under the said Acts have been permitted to start schools from the academic year 2019-2020.
As per the provisions of Section 11 of the Maharashtra Self-Financed Schools (Establishment and Regulation) Act, 2012, it has been made mandatory for the management to start the school within eighteen months from the date of the government permission order. But due to the lockdown announced by the government from time to time due to the outbreak of the Covid-19 virus, the school managements could not complete the construction of the school and start the school within the stipulated time. The government was considering to extend the deadline for the educational institutions which have been unable to start schools from the academic year 2020-2021 due to the situation arising out of the Covid-19 virus.
Decision of the Government Under the Maharashtra Self-Financed Schools (Establishment and Regulation) Act, 2012 (01 of 2013), the educational institutions which have been granted permission to start new schools on self-financing basis or to upgrade the status of existing schools for the academic year 2019-2020 and the prescribed period of eighteen months for the opening of schools run by such institutions is expiring between 01.06.2020 and 31.03.2021, are being extended as a special case to start a new school or upgrade the status of an existing school from the academic year 2021-2022.
