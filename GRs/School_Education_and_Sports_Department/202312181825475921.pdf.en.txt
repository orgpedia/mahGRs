Government Resolution No: SFS-1023/ S.No.928/ SM-2
Madam Cama Marg, Hutatma Rajguru Chowk,
Mantralaya, Mumbai- 400 032
Date: 18th of December 2023
The Proposal:
The Maharashtra Self-Financed Schools (Establishment and Regulation) Act, 2012 and the Maharashtra Self-Financed Schools (Establishment and Regulation) Rules, 2020 lay down the modalities for setting up new schools on a self-financing basis and upgrading the existing school. However, many schools have been opened without the permission of the government. Students studying in such unauthorisedly run schools suffer academic loss. Therefore, considering the educational interest of the students, the government was considering issuing instructions to prevent the opening of unauthorized schools in the future.
Government's decision:
" Henceforth, if any new unauthorised school is opened in any part of the state, the concerned education officer will be held personally responsible and disciplinary action will be taken against the concerned education officer. "
