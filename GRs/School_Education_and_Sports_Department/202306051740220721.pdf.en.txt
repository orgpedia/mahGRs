The Proposal:

The Maharashtra State Lawn Tennis Association (MSLTA) is organizing the Maharashtra Open Tennis Tournament under the ATP World Tour 250 Series at Shivchhatrapati Sports Complex, Balewadi, Pune from 2017-18 to 2022-23. The Maharashtra Open ATP 250 is one of the top tennis tournaments in the world and has now become a truly world-class event on the ATP tennis calendar.
The tournament, organised by the state, has given a huge boost to Brand Maharashtra on the global sports scene. Maharashtra has been the top state in the field of sports and especially among tennis lovers at the global level. MMRDA, PMC, PCMC, MIDC, Department of Sports and Youth Welfare as well as Tata Motors have come forward as corporate title sponsors and set the trend for other organisations and governments to follow in the last five years.
The top five players in the top 50 are Marin Cilic, Kevin Anderson, Benoit Paire, Jiri Vesely, Gilles Simon, Aslan Karatsev, Emil Ruusuvuori and Botic van de Zandschulp. Rajeev Ram and Joe Salisbury, the current world number two, were competing in the tournament scheduled for 2023. This tournament has helped Indian and Maharashtra players to rise in the world rankings. The other Davis Cuppers in the top bracket are Prajnesh Gunneswaran, Ramkumar Ramanathan, Yuki Bhambri, Sumit Nagal, Saketh Myneni and Rohan Bopanna. For Maharashtra, Arjun Kadhe (now 130 in the world) has been able to break into the top 150 in the world rankings.
Manas Dhamne, a 15-year-old Asian Junior and IOR champion, is part of the Maharashtra Open Development Programme. He has participated in the tournament in 2023 and also played in the Australian Open Junior Grand Slam in 2023.
