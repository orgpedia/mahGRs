Accordingly, as per the decision of the Government dated 22nd June, 2015, the implementation of the" Advanced Education Maharashtra" programme was started in the State. To improve the quality of education, the classroom environment should be vibrant, engaging and engaging. Classrooms should have a variety of resources that stimulate children to think, nurture their inventive spirit, encourage them to seek and use innovative information, and provide opportunities for action. It is important to give children the opportunity to engage in activities that stimulate curiosity and stimulate thinking through hands-on activities, rather than just focusing on listening in the classroom. So that the children can be helped to consolidate the concept of science, they can enjoy self-creation.
