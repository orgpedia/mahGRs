Madam Cama Marg, Hutatma Rajguru Chowk,
Ministry, Mumbai- 400 032.
Date: 6th of December, 2022.
(1) Government Resolution No.RTE-2013/ P.No.20/ P.S-1 dated 31st December, 2013.
(2) Government Resolution No. 62/ SD-4, dated 16th June, 2021.
The Proposal:
Maharashtra government has decided to bifurcate government, aided, unaided and self-financed schools in the state. Some government and aided schools are running for classes 5 to 10, classes 8 to 10 and classes 1 to 10. Since these schools also include primary classes, the Right to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009 is applicable to such schools. The implementation of the provisions of the Act has been clearly mentioned in the Government Resolution No.RTE-2013/ PR No. 20/ PR-1, dated 31st December, 2013 of the Department of School Education.
After the Covid pandemic period, the government has noticed that due to some reasons (e.g. If a student has not been issued a TC (Transfer Certificate) or Leaving Certificate from his private school due to financial difficulties or non-payment of fees, such students are not admitted to a government or funded school without this certificate. This results in the loss of students and their academic year. As per Section 5 (2) and (3) of the RTE Act, a student is entitled to get admission from one school to another. Under normal circumstances, the school head of the parent school gives a T.C. (Transfer Certificate) immediately for admission to another school. However, if for any reason, such certificate is delayed or denied, it will be unfair to delay admission or deny admission in another school (government or aided).
According to Section 18 of the Secondary School Code, this provision has been clarified in the case of admission from one school to another.
