Introduction: The Department of School Education has taken various initiatives for administrative reforms and quality enhancement for which various computer systems have been developed or are in use.
The movement of digital schools, tech-friendly teachers is spreading across the state. Technology is changing rapidly. Therefore, the importance of e-governance in the education sector is increasing.
In order to implement the flagship and other schemes of the Education Department in a dynamic manner and to make them people-oriented, it is necessary to continuously improve the existing computer system by making maximum use of e-governance. However, after the expiry of the service contract of the companies manufacturing these computer systems, it was sometimes difficult to continue the system and make some improvements in the system. Also, due to lack of technical competence, the concerned computer system manufacturing organization cannot be effectively monitored by the concerned Directorate of Education. As a result, projects are delayed, costs are increased, and results are lost. In view of these issues, the Government is contemplating to set up an" e-Governance Committee and Cell" under the supervision of the Commissioner (Education).
Government's decision:
Approval is being given to set up an e-governance committee and cell under the control of Commissioner (Education), Pune by overruling the earlier decisions of the Government of Wacha 1 to 3 under the School Education Department.
