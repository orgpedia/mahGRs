Para 52 of the Budget Speech for the year 2020-21 has announced" It is proposed to organize Mini Olympic Games in association with Maharashtra Olympic Association to promote various sports and to provide competitive exposure to the athletes, which will also benefit the sports promotion of Divyang athletes." However, due to the COVID-19 situation, these tournaments have not been considered for the 2020-21 and 2021-22 seasons. or
The event will be jointly organised by the Maharashtra government and the Maharashtra Olympic Association. Safety, medical facilities, travel gear, etc. need to be provided for this tournament. For this, the government was considering the formation of two committees- a high-level committee at the state level and the main tournament organizing committee in Pune- and deciding their jurisdiction.
