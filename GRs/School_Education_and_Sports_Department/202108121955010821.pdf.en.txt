Preamble: The lockdown imposed in the country since 24th March 2020 in the backdrop of COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant social and economic impacts
As a result, the economy has collapsed and many parents are not in a position to pay the fees of their children studying in self-financing private schools, the Government has received representations from many parents regarding reduction/ waiver of school fees in this extraordinary situation
02. Ma. The Supreme Court in Appeal No. 1724/2021, Indian School Jodhpur v. State of Rajasthan. The Supreme Court has passed the following orders dated 03.05.2021:
116....As aforesaid, we would assume that the least 15 percent of the annual school fees would be towards overheads/expenses saved by the school Management. Arguendo, this assumption is on the higher side than the actual savings by the school management of private unaided schools, yet we are inclined to fix that percentage because the educational institutions are engaged in doing charitable activity of imparting and spreading education and not make money. That they must willingly and proactively do. Hence, collection of commensurate amount (15 percent of the annual school fees for academic year 2020-2021), would be a case of profiteering and commercialisation by the school Management.
117. Ordinarily, we would have thought it appropriate to relegate the parties before the Regulatory Authority to refix the school fees for the academic year 2020-21 after taking into account all aspects of the matter including the advantage gained by the school Management due to unspent overheads/expenses in respect of facilities not availed by the students. However, that course can be obviated by the arrangement that we propose to direct in terms of this judgement. To avoid multiplicity of proceedings (as school fee structure is linked to school- school wise)

including uncertainty of legal processes by over 36,000 schools in determination of annual fee structure for the academic year 2020-21, as one-time measure to do complete justice between the parties, we propose to issue following directions:
(i) The appellants (School Management of the concerned private unaided school) shall collect annual school fees from their students as fixed under the Act of 2016 for the academic year 2019-20 but by providing deduction of 15 percent on the amount in lieu of unutilised facilities by the students during the relevant period of academic year 2020-21.
(ii) The amount so payable by the concerned students be paid in six equal monthly installments before 05.08.2021 as noted in our order dated 08.02.2021.
(iii) Regardless of the above, it will be open to the appellants (concerned schools) to give further concession to their students or to evolve a different pattern for giving concession over and above those noted in clauses (i) and (ii) above.
(iv) The school Management shall not debar any student from attending either online classes or physical classes on account of non-payment of fees. arrears/outstanding fees including the installments,referred to above, and shall not withhold the result of the examinations of any student on that account.
(v) If any individual request is made by the parent/ward finding it difficult to remit annual fees for the academic year 2020-21 in the above terms, the school Management to consider such representation on case-to-case basis sympathetically.
(vi) The above arrangement will not affect collection of fees for the academic year 2021-22, as is payable by the students of the concerned school as and when it becomes due and payable.
(vii) The school management shall not withhold the name of any student/candidate for the ensuing Board examinations for classes X and XII on the ground of non-payment of fee/ arrears for the academic year 2020-21, if any, on obtaining undertaking of the concerned parents/students.
118. We are conscious of the fact that we are issuing general uniform direction of deduction of 15 per cent of the annual school fees in lieu of unutilized facilities/activities and not on the basis of actual data school wise. As aforesaid, we have chosen to do so with a view to obviate avoidable litigation and to give finality to the issue of determination and collection of school fees for the academic year 2020-21, as a one-time measure which is the subject matter of these appeals. We have consciously limited the quantum of deduction from annual school fees to 15 per cent although the school Management had mentioned about its willingness to provide 25 per cent scholarship to deserving students, as we have compelled the school Management to collect annual school fees for the academic year 2020-21 as was fixed for the academic year

2019-20 on which some of the school Management (s) could have legitimately asked for increase of at least 10 percent in terms of Section 6 (5) of the Act of 2016.
Some parents of students for the academic year 2020-21, approved under this Act.
As per the school fee structure, the fee is provided. However, the state. Schools were closed for most of the period since March 24, 2020 due to the outbreak of COVID-19 and the lockdown announced by the government to control the pandemic.
There are also restrictions on travel. As a result, due to the situation created by this universal pandemic, students could not attend school physically and certain educational facilities for which fees were charged and in some cases such fees were provided, were not utilised. Schools also conducted classes either online or through virtual mode or e-learning. Charging fees when students are unable to avail or use educational facilities amounts to profiteering or commercialisation of education and is expressly prohibited by well-established law.
On the other hand, in the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, many have lost their jobs and businesses have also been adversely affected.
04. The Supreme Court in Special Leave Petition Diary No. 15417/2021, Jayshree Sunil Deshpande and others Vs. Government of Maharashtra and others dated 22nd July, 2021 in the said court case has passed the following order: If the petitioners so desire, they are free to take recourse thereto before the competent authority. That may be answered by the competent authority appropriately and in accordance with law, including by keeping in mind the dictum of this Court in Indian School, Jodhpur Vs. State of Rajasthan reported in 2021 SCC online SC 359.

50 per cent discount on taxes and 50 per cent discount on development charges.
The COVID-19 pandemic is still raging and schools are yet to resume normal physical activities. Also, many schools do not have an executive committee. Considering the large number of private schools in the state, it is not practically possible to calculate the amount saved by each school for non-utilized educational facilities school-wise and considering the possibility that this may take a long time, it is necessary to provide some amount of educational fee relief to the parents in the given situation. Based on the decision of the Supreme Court on the fee reduction, it is proposed to reduce 15 percent of the total fixed fees for the academic year 2021-22.
Article 162 of the Constitution of India provides for the power of the state to make laws.
In the state also, schools have been closed for a long time since March 2020 in most parts of the state and online education is being provided to the students. The background and the The government has taken the decision in accordance with the Supreme Court's order.
Government Decision: As a one-time measure for the academic year 2021-22, the following directions are being issued to all the Boards and all the medium schools:
The total fee fixed for the academic year 2021-22 should be reduced by 15 percent.
2) Parents who have paid the full fee earlier, such excess fee should be adjusted by the school management in the next month or quarterly instalments or in the next year or if it is not possible to adjust the fee in this way, the fee should be refunded.
(3) If any dispute arises in respect of the reduced fee, such dispute shall be referred to the concerned Divisional Fee Regulatory Committee or the Government Resolution No. Grievance Redressal in Group as per Grievance No.50/ SD-4, dated 26th February, 2020
The decision taken by the Departmental Fee Regulatory Committee or the Departmental Grievance Redressal Committee in this regard shall be final.
