Introduction: Various schemes for the development of sports and youth welfare are being implemented under the Directorate of Sports and Youth Services. The schemes include creation of sports infrastructure, grooming of successful and talented sportspersons, financial assistance for state-of-the-art training, incentives and recognition to sportspersons, organizing sports events to promote the latent qualities of school students, honorarium to senior sportspersons, grants under Gymnasium and Stadium Development Scheme, 5% reservation in government and semi-government services to sportspersons, daily sports training under District Sports Training Centre, sports marks concession, scholarships to sportspersons and assistance to youth festivals, youth welfare activities etc.
It is very important to develop a well-equipped integrated computer system for effective implementation of the schemes and for systematic management of sports development matters.
At present, due to the lack of such a system, it is becoming difficult to provide the benefits of state schemes to the players. At present, the details of competitions and performance of players are not being saved under the integrated system, which is creating difficulties in getting information about various competitions, settling job reservation cases quickly. There have been cases of cheating on the basis of fake sports certificates and results under player reservation. Accordingly, it is important to have an effective system of collecting competition results and take appropriate measures. There is a need to develop a system to provide unified information to the sports associations and sports department offices through computer system. Accordingly, e-Governance under Directorate of Sports and Youth Services- Integrated Computer System for Administrative Management
