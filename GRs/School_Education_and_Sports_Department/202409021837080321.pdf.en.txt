The Proposal -
The Central Government vide Notification dated 31.03.2010 has declared the National Council for Teacher Education (917) as the Educational Authority for determining the eligibility and service conditions for appointment to the posts of teachers. The National Council for Teacher Education, vide notification dated 23rd August, 2010, has issued a Notification for Primary Teachers (ECT). 1st to 8th standard) minimum academic and professional qualification has been fixed and Teacher Eligibility Test (TET) has been made mandatory.
Accordingly, the State Government vide Government Decision dated 13.02.2013 and Corrigendum dated 06.03.2013 has decided to extend the age limit for primary teachers in the State (e.g. The minimum professional qualification of teachers from 1st to 8th standard has been fixed and the Central Teacher Eligibility Test (CTET) conducted by the Central Government or Teacher Eligibility Test (TET) conducted by the Government of Maharashtra has been made mandatory as per the guidelines of the National Council for Teacher Education.
The decision of exempting compassionate education servants from passing the Teacher Eligibility Test under the Government Decision Date 20.01.2016 is inconsistent with the eligibility set by the National Council for Teacher Education. Therefore, the government was considering making a provision requiring newly appointed teachers to pass the Teacher Eligibility Test on compassionate grounds.
The Government's Decision-
Provisions are being made for compassionate teachers and newly appointed teachers to pass the Teacher Eligibility Test as follows: -
1. the decision of the government. Paragraph No in 20.01.2016. The text in section 3 "However, they shall continue to be eligible for the conditions of passing both the Teacher Eligibility Test (I) and the Central Pre-Recruitment Selection Test."

Since the Teacher Eligibility Test has been made mandatory in the State under the Government Decision dated 13.02.2013, teachers who have not passed the Teacher Eligibility Test (7) conducted by the State Government or the Teacher Eligibility Test (121) conducted by the Central Government who have been appointed as Primary Teachers on compassionate grounds under the Government Decision dated 20.01.2016 and have been granted Personal Recognition and Childhood ID shall hold the Teacher Eligibility Test within a period of three years from the date of such Government Decision.
3. Under the aegis of the Department of Rural Development. Under the letter of 11.10.2022, the Teacher Eligibility Test or Central Teacher Eligibility Test has been made mandatory for appointment to the post of primary teachers on compassionate grounds. However, since there is a provision in the government decision, the institutions have made the appointment on compassionate grounds. Provided that candidates who have not been approved or provided with a Childhood ID by the Education Officer and the Deputy Director of Zonal Education shall also be given a Compassionate Recognition / Childhood ID on the condition that they qualify the Teacher Eligibility Test or the Central Teacher Eligibility Test within 3 years.
After a period of three years, the service of the candidates appointed to the post of teachers who cannot qualify the Teacher Eligibility Test (7) or the Central Teacher Eligibility Test (171) shall be terminated.
However, since such appointments are made in accordance with the compassionate policy, the appointing authority should take action regarding their appointment to other positions. The service seniority of such candidates will be the last in the seniority list in this category.
