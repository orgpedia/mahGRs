The Proposal:
At present, the recruitment of teachers in the state is done on the basis of the marks obtained in the teacher aptitude and intelligence test at the state level for the local bodies and all the management in the state.

One has to leave one's own district and work in another district. There are also frequent demands from teachers for inter-district transfers. Also, teachers should come to the new district on zero service capacity after transfer.
Therefore, teachers need to be provided with job opportunities in their own district.
So that students have access to teachers in their own area, teachers in a more efficient manner.
Teachers at the district or division level will work and will definitely help in providing quality education to the students by removing the loopholes in the prevailing teacher recruitment.
A study of the recruitment process to suggest the appropriate methodology for teacher recruitment.
