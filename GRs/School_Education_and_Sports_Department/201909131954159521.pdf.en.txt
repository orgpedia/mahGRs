2. For direct sanction of enhanced 20% subsidy under this Government decision, sanction orders will be issued in the ensuing session of the Legislative Assembly on sanction of funds through Supplementary Demands.
The Director of Education (Primary/ Secondary and Higher Secondary) shall submit a clear report to the Government regarding the fulfillment of the criteria/ documents after examining all the above-mentioned aspects regarding the said primary/ secondary schools/ batches before submitting the proposal of supplementary demand to the Finance Department for sanction of grants. Some of these inspected schools/ batches will be inspected by the Finance Department at random. If the school/ batch/ additional branch is found ineligible in the inspection of the Finance Department, strict action will be taken against the concerned officers/ employees who qualify it.
4. Appropriate action for sanction of direct grant to schools/ units fulfilling the criteria and documents will be taken at the government level.
Autonomy of Government:- A school declared eligible for grant-in-aid does not acquire the right to grant-in-aid. It is the" discretionary power" of the government to sanction grants to schools that have been declared eligible for grants and the government will decide on sanctioning grants to schools that are eligible for grants based on the availability of funds. This subsidy will not be applied retrospectively. Further, it is again brought to the notice of all concerned that even if the schools are approved in any academic year on non-grant basis, the government will change the grant-in-aid formula keeping in view the financial position of the state, financial resources available from time to time, needs of the state and their priorities and the grant-in-aid formula will be applicable to the schools which have not been sanctioned the grant-in-aid.
This Government decision is being issued in accordance with the Finance Department's Informal Reference No. 545/19/ Expenditure-5 dated 27th August, 2019.
