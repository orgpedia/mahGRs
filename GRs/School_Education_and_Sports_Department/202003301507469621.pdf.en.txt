The lockdown has been imposed in the country to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Thousands of migrant workers have been left without work due to the closure of various businesses and are looking for a way to return to their native places. The state government has decided to close all schools in the state. Hence, students are not attending schools. Schools are available to provide shelter. In such a situation, temporary accommodation is being allowed in these government/ local body schools to provide temporary support/ shelter to the bargain workers.
The education officers of the Zilla Parishad and the concerned Municipal Corporation/ Municipality are being instructed to immediately bring the above suggestions to the notice of all concerned and provide temporary shelter to the migrant labourers in the schools of the government/ local bodies. The district collector should be consulted while selecting the school. They should also be provided with other facilities. This facility should be made available till the end of the lockdown.
