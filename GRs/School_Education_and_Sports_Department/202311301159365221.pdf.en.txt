Introduction: In order to create a sense of responsibility towards the school among the teachers, parents, students and alumni of all management and all medium schools in the state and to provide a pleasant and inspiring environment for students to learn from a competitive environment, it is proposed to implement the' Mukhyamantri Majhi School, Sundar School' campaign under the Bharat Ratna Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Model School Scheme.
Bharat Ratna Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Adarsh Vidyalaya Yojana is a fully state sponsored scheme being implemented in the state from 2020-21. Key areas such as creation of physical facilities, enhancement of educational quality and administrative reforms have been identified for the scheme. At present, the first phase of the scheme, covering 478 schools, is operational. The scheme is applicable to all government and private schools.
Under the Bharat Ratna Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Adarsh Vidyalaya Yojana, so far only the construction of physical facilities has been taken care of and funds have been provided for small and big constructions under this component. In order to expand the mission more effectively, it has become necessary to incorporate a number of factors such as quality of education, use of modern technology in teaching/ administration, awareness of environmental conservation, public and personal hygiene, good health, efforts to enhance the sense of national integration, exposure to vocational education, development of built-in art and sports qualities, etc. If such important factors are given priority in the right proportion, the overall development of the school can definitely take place.
The best solution is for schools to compete among themselves to ensure that the above components are implemented effectively. Therefore, the proposal to implement the competitive campaign' Mukhyamantri Majhi School, Sundar School' under the Bharat Ratna Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Adarsh School Scheme was under the consideration of the government.
