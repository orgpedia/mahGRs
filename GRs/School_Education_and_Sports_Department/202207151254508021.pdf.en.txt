The Department of School Education and Sports is the implementing department of the government circular.
The Controlling Authorities and Drawing and Disbursing Authorities have been notified from time to time regarding the amount of subsidy to be disbursed under the social service as well as the amount to be deposited.
The Drawing and Disbursing Officers for the new schemes have been declared from time to time under Rule 15 (3) of the Maharashtra Treasury Rules, 1968.
The scheme and sub-accounts for the year 2022-2023 under the School Education and Sports Department are as per Form-A titled Drawing and Disbursing Officer and Controlling Officer.
Since the Drawing and Disbursing Officer and the Controlling Officer are supposed to be separate officers, as per the provisions of the Maharashtra Budget Rulebook Clause 1 and the Maharashtra Treasury Rules, 1968, in any further administrative approval of the scheme by any authority, the Government may take a decision. They are being declared as Controlling Officer and Drawing and Disbursing Officer.
If new schemes not in Form A are to be declared as Drawing and Disbursing Officer and Controlling Officer as per the provisions of Maharashtra Budget Rule Book Clause 1 and Maharashtra Treasury Rules 1968, the same should be sent to the Budget Office for informal approval.
