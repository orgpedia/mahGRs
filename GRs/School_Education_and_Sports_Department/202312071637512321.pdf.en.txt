The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (Amendment) Act, 2019. January 11, 2019.
Maharashtra Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (Amendment) Act, 2023. before May 29, 2023.
Introduction: The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 came into force with effect from 1st April, 2010. Section 16 of the said Act states that no child shall be placed in the same class or expelled from school till the completion of his elementary education.

Reference No. The Maharashtra government has amended Rule 3 and Rule 10 of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Rules, 2011. The exam will be held for classes 5 to 8.

Government Resolution No: RTE-2022/ PR No.276/ SD-1
A provision has been made. Accordingly, the matter of determining the annual examination, re-examination and evaluation procedure for Class 5 and Class 8 was under the consideration of the government.
Government Decision: The Annual Examination, Re-examination and Evaluation Procedure for Class 5th and Class 8th are being implemented from 2023-24 as follows.
(1) Procedural and legal aspects: Reference No. Under Section 2 of the Act, a continuous comprehensive evaluation system for classes 1 to 8 has been implemented in the State of Maharashtra from the academic year 2010-11.
Accordingly, students from class 1 to class 8 are assessed both quantitatively and cumulatively. As per point 2.10 of the said procedure, it shall be mandatory for the schools and teachers to provide additional supplementary guidance to such students if they get grade D and below and bring them up to minimum grade C-2. However, such students cannot be accommodated in the same class under any circumstances.
Therefore, no child is considered to have failed in any class or placed in the same class until the 8th grade.
Annual Examination Requirements for Classes 5 and 8 (Limitations of the prevailing assessment method): 1) Many parents are of the view that students do not fail till Class 8, which means that students are not assessed. There is a feeling in the society that the annual examination should be conducted as before.
Under the Continuous Comprehensive Evaluation (CCE), a child could not be placed in the same class even if, for some reason, he/ she had not achieved the expected learning achievement (C-2 grade). It was necessary to enter the next class.
3) Students were deprived of studies as they did not fail till class 8.
4) Since the child has to be admitted according to age, if the child is admitted in the upper class, the study achievement of the next class will not be achieved as expected, so the child's further studies will be hindered.
3. The expected benefits of the new system of Annual Examination for Class V and Class VIII are: 1. At the primary stage of education from Class I to Class V, it will be objectively ensured that the students have achieved the desired learning outcomes.

Government Resolution No: RTE-2022/ PR No.276/ SD-1
2) At the stage of upper primary education from class 6th to class 8th, it will be objectively ascertained whether the students have achieved the expected learning outcomes.
3) Students can be admitted to upper primary and secondary level only by strengthening the foundation of primary education.
4) It may be ensured that the learning outcomes of the students at the primary level are achieved before admission to the age-matched classes at the upper primary level.
5) Exceptionally relaxed marks for the annual examination, provision of additional supplementary guidance and opportunity for re-examination are some of the special purposes for which the fear of examination can be removed from the students.
The objective of the annual examination for class 5th and class 8th is to: 1) Examine every student of class 5th and class 8th to ensure that the expected learning achievement in each subject is achieved by the end of the year.
2) To ensure that every student of class 5th and class 8th who has not obtained the expected study score at the end of the year, has obtained the expected study score by conducting a re-examination by providing additional supplementary guidance for the subject concerned.
3) To inculcate the habit of regular studies in the students and prepare them to face further academic challenges/ competitive examinations.
(a) Annual Examination and Evaluation Procedure for Class 5th and 8th: 1) Annual Examination for Class 5th and 8th: 1) Formal Evaluation in 1st and 2nd Semester for Class 5th and 8th. The continuous comprehensive evaluation will be carried out as per the procedure prescribed by 20th August, 2010.
2) The second semester of Composite Assessment will be referred to as Annual Assessment as per the Continuous Comprehensive Assessment methodology.
(3) However, the evaluation of Composite Assessment 1 will be carried out as per the prevailing Continuous Comprehensive Evaluation methodology.
