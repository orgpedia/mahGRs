Introduction: With a view to familiarize the students with the English language from the primary level as well as to reduce the burden of the office of the school students, it has been decided to provide integrated and bilingual textbooks in a phased manner to the students studying in Marathi and Urdu medium in all the primary schools of the state. 1 was taken. Accordingly, the Textbook Board had prepared integrated-bilingual textbooks for students of Class I and II and distributed Class I textbooks to all government schools and Class II textbooks to only 488 model schools on a pilot basis.
However, the following points have been observed while implementing integrated and bilingual textbooks.
In consultation with the teachers working in the education sector in the society as well as in the physical teaching, it has been found that while using the bilingual method, the students have difficulty in learning the native language and therefore the learning of the native language (regional language/ mother tongue) is not done properly.
Since the integrated and bilingual textbooks are wrapped around a specific theme, it has been found that there are many difficulties in rationalizing the subjects of Marathi language, English language and mathematics as well as teaching grammar.
3. As per NIPUN Bharat Mission, the new learning outcomes have been defined and the Central Government's directions/ instructions are to implement them from pre-primary (Balvatika, Balwadi and Anganwadi) level to Class III. However, the level of learning outcomes used for integrated and bilingual textbooks is lower than the level of learning outcomes mentioned in NIPUN Bharat Abhiyan and is based on outdated curriculum.
