The Proposal:
Under the School Education and Sports Department, the Education Officer (Primary) acts as the head of administration for primary education in the district, while the Education Officer (Secondary) carries out the work of secondary education in the same district. Although the education officer is a position in the administration branch, it is the responsibility of every education officer to provide quality education to the students. The District Education Officer (Primary) is responsible for the primary education of the students in the district and the Education Officer (Secondary) is responsible for the secondary education of the students in the district. The Education Officer (Continuing) is responsible for the education of minority students in the district where the post of Education Officer (Continuing) is held.
The District Educational Continuing Professional Development Agency is responsible for training, guiding, reviewing students as well as teachers to provide quality education to every student in the state.
At present, District Institute of Continuing Professional Development is functioning in 33 districts, except 2 districts of Palghar and Mumbai (city and suburbs). His principal post is with the principal. The post of Principal in the Education Empowerment Branch is equivalent to the rank of Deputy Director of Education in the Administration Branch with a salary scale of Rs. 15600 39100 Grade Pay Rs. The salary is Rs 6,600. 15600-39100 Grade Pay Rs. 5,400 respectively.
In the prevailing system, the confidential report of the education officer (performance appraisal report) is referred to the Chief Executive Officer of the District Council and reviewed by the Divisional Deputy Director of Education in that educational department. However, the government was contemplating a change in the policy.
Confidential reports relating to the educational work of the education officers should be reviewed at the level of the Principal, District Educational Continuing Professional Development Agency (District Education and Training Institute).
Therefore, the matter of declaring the Reporting Officer and Reviewing Officer for writing the confidential report of the Education Officer (Performance Evaluation Report) was under the consideration of the government. The government has taken the following steps in this regard:
