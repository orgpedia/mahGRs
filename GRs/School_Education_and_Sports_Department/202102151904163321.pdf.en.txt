Government Resolution No. PRASH/ 2021/ PR. No.17/ SM-4,
In a partial modification, it was decided to examine the proposals for assessment submitted by the Commissioner (Education) to the Government through the School Education Department instead of the Finance Department before giving direct grants to the Primary, Secondary and Higher Secondary Schools which were declared eligible for grants under the Government decision dated 13th September 2019. It was also decided in the cabinet meeting to examine the schools which were earlier given 20 percent grant before sanctioning the next increased 20 percent phase grant. It also partially modified the government's decision dated September 13, 2019. It was decided in the Cabinet meeting to approve the extension from November 1, 2020. Accordingly, an inspection team was appointed by the School Education Department. The inspection team visited the primary schools/ batches at the regional level in the state. The inspection team inspected the primary/ middle/ high school schools and submitted the report of the primary schools/ batches to the government and according to the report, the matter of declaring the eligible primary schools/ batches eligible for grants was under the consideration of the government.
Government Decision: As per the Government Decision No. (6), an increased grant of 20% was sanctioned with effect from 01.04.2019 for the posts of teachers/ non-teaching staff in the schools and batches where total grant of 20% was sanctioned. The government is taking decisions.
The proposals received from the Commissioner Education have been examined by the School Education Department and a total of 4131 teacher posts in 456 primary schools identified in Form A and 1565 teacher posts in 1340 classes/ batches of 345 primary schools identified in Form B along with the schools that have qualified in the said examination are being sanctioned with an increased grant of 20% from 01.11.2020. Also, the proposals for filling up the deficiencies of the schools/ batches which are shown in Form A-1 and Form A-2 and are disqualified due to lack of certain documents should be submitted to the government within 30 days.
The schools/ batches which have been found to be eligible for grant-in-aid on the basis of the information received at the field level are found to be fulfilling the criteria and conditions of the Government Decisions dated 15th November, 2011 and 16th July, 2013. These schools will be eligible for grant-in-aid only for the sanctioned posts (grant-in-aid eligible class units) in the last grade (2018-19) and for the posts of teachers, whichever is higher, mentioned in the original Government decision/ Government Corrigendum.
4. No re-examination is required to be done while giving grant to schools in Form A and B declared eligible for grant under this Government decision.
(5) If a school is eligible for grant, it is not entitled to grant. It is the prerogative of the government to sanction grants to schools declared eligible for grants. This subsidy will not be applicable retrospectively. Considering the financial position of the state, financial resources available from time to time, needs of the state and their priorities, the government will make changes in the grant formula and the grant formula will be applicable to the schools which have not been sanctioned the grant at the time when the grant is to be sanctioned.
