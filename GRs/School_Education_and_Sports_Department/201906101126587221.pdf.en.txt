Children can't read without writing. A lot of reading is required to increase conceptual fluency. Concepts of different subjects will be strengthened only when children can read well. For this, if they can easily get such abundant material for their future reading, it will definitely be helpful in increasing the reading culture. The child constructs knowledge through observation, object handling, exchange, listening, experience. Children learn very quickly.
Accordingly, by providing the necessary pedagogical materials for multi-class and multi-level teaching based on epistemology, to explain the concepts of the English language subject in an easy and accessible way, it will help to teach the language and mathematics subjects to our children in an easy and interesting way.
