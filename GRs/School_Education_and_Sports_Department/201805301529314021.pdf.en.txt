If there are reasons or errors, the action to report them will be taken by the Education Officer Primary/ Secondary within one month. As per the provisions of the Government Resolution dated 26th July, 2004 of the Tribal Development Department, in serial number (2) (3), there is a provision to provide 100% grant from the tribal application to the schools in the tribal sub-plan area. However, since the Government Decision dated 15th November, 2011 does not contain any provision regarding 100% grant from Tribal Appropriation Fund to the schools in the tribal sub-plan area, 100% grant is not admissible to these schools. Keeping this in view, the following provision is also being inserted in Act No. 10.
(10.2)" 100% grant will be admissible to the primary and secondary schools declared eligible for grant as per the assessment in the tribal sub-plan area, if the approval of the Tribal Development Department and the Finance Department is obtained otherwise the grant formula of this department will be applicable to the said schools. " 3. The proviso to Rule 11 of the Government Order, dated 15th November, 2011 reads as follows:"" A school becomes eligible for grant-in-aid, which means that the school does not acquire the right to grant-in-aid."
It is the" discretion" of the government to apply to the concerned schools and the government will apply the grant to the eligible schools as per the availability of funds. This subsidy will not be applied retrospectively.
Further, even if the schools are approved in any academic year on a non-grant basis, the Government will modify the grant formula taking into account the financial resources available around the time and the needs of the State and their priorities. "
The above provision is being amended as follows: (11) Autonomy of assessment and grant" A school is declared eligible for grant-in-aid i. e. it is not entitled for grant-in-aid. It is the" prerogative" of the government to assess and sanction grants to schools which have been declared eligible for grants. This subsidy will not be applied retrospectively. Further, even if the schools are approved in any academic year on a non-grant basis, the government will change the grant formula taking into account the financial position of the state, financial resources available from time to time, needs of the state and their priorities.
