The Proposal:
Since there is no opportunity for promotion for non-teaching staff in private schools in the state or if available, it takes a long time to get promotion, the reference No. 2 As per the decision of the Government here, the non-teaching staff will be given the pay scale of the top position in their promotion chain after 12 years of regular service and the employees who are promoted to the post in the promotion chain.
For those posts which do not exist, the higher pay scale mentioned in the Annexure accompanying the said Government Decision. Implemented since 1/04/1998. Thereafter, No. 3 As per the decision of the government here, this scheme was given to the non-teaching staff in private schools. Implemented since 1/10/1994. Also Reference No. 4 The flaws found in the scheme have been removed under the government decision here.
However, since there is no order regarding the senior category of the Assured Progress Scheme payable to such non-teaching staff who do not have a promotion post or who have a lone post, as well as the revised pay scale payable to the said senior category, it has come to the notice of the Government that the cadre of Librarian, the lone post of non-teaching staff, has been made payable to them. Therefore, the Senior Pay Scale payable in the 5th/ 6th Commission in accordance with the time-bound promotion benefit to the post of Librarian and Teacher-Solvent as well as
