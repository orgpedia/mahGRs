(Manual on Financial Management and Procurement). As per the provisions of the FMP Manual, the State Government has the power to regulate the scheme at the State level. However, it has been noticed that the approval of the government is not taken while preparing the Annual Work Plan (AWP) of the scheme and determining the priorities in the submitted plan. Also, the funds sanctioned by the central government to the state government as reimbursement are not directly reimbursed to the state government.
The government was trying to control the situation.
The scheme is being implemented on 60:40 sharing basis between the Centre and the state governments. The e-tender in this scheme is sent to the government for approval along with the necessary documents before publishing.
Also, the government's approval is taken for L-1 even after the e-tendering is finalised.
However, the necessary documents (draft tender, technical specifications) are not obtained from the government before publishing the e-tender of the procurement in the" Samagra Shiksha" scheme. Also, even after the e-tendering is finalised, no action is being taken to get the government's approval. The Maharashtra Primary Education Council provides computers, sports materials, supplementary reading materials, books, and other educational materials to the students. However, complaints of irregularities in some procurement cases are received by the government from time to time.
Therefore, in order to bring transparency in the procurement under the Samagra Shiksha scheme and to control it properly, the government was considering to give revised directions in the procurement of Samagra Shiksha scheme as per the procedures in the School Nutrition Scheme.
The government has issued a notification in this regard.
GOVERNMENT DECISIONS: The Government is issuing the following orders for the implementation and control of the Samagra Shiksha programme.
