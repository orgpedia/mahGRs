Albert Einstein once said," Generations to come will scarcely believe that a skeleton like Mahatma Gandhi ever walked this earth." We get to experience various facets of Gandhiji's life.
The Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi had an independent role in education.
Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, who said' Mera Jeevan Hi Mera Sandesh Hai', was a great personality who influenced the twentieth century. Gandhiji's ideals of truth, non-violence, love, cleanliness, self-reliance, swadeshi, compassion and humanity were considered by him as his way of life. Considering humanity and non-violence as the center of his life, he spent his entire life not for the country but for the entire mankind and devoted himself for the welfare of mankind.
He was ordinary by birth but became world-famous by his work. Rabindranath Tagore addressed him in a letter as' Mahatma', from then on he became' Mahatma' to the younger generation.
The messages that he has given through his conduct and thoughts at various stages of his life are significant even in the 21st century. In the education conference of Wardha in 1937, he presented his educational stance by giving' Nai Talim' education system. Children between the ages of 7 and 14 should get free and compulsory education, the medium of education should be the mother tongue, literacy cannot be called education, education should develop human qualities in human beings, education is not a means but a means. On the occasion of Martyr's Day and the commemoration of this great man who played an important role in making India an independent nation, it is necessary to introduce the ideas of Mahatma Gandhi to all the students of the state and the new generation on January 30. Accordingly, the government was considering the matter of organizing various educational programs for students and teachers in all schools.
