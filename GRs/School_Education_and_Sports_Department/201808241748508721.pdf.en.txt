The Central Government has amended Section 23 of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 vide notification dated 09.08.2017 and extended the period of acquiring minimum qualification for the post of Primary Teacher for a further period of 4 years with effect from 31.03.2015.
Further, as per the Government Notification dated 17.10.2017, Rule 19 (1) (2) of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Rules, 2010 has been amended from 5 years to 9 years. Therefore, the relaxation given in the Government Circular dated 30.06.2016 to qualify the Teacher Eligibility Test is inconsistent with the extension given by the Central Government in this regard.
