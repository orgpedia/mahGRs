Government of India NIPUN Bharat FLN Mission Guidelines, dated 06/07/2021.
Preamble: As per the National Education Policy 2020, attaining basic linguistic and mathematical skills at the primary level has been accorded top priority by 2026-27. It highlights that many students at the primary level are yet to acquire basic literacy and numeracy. A national mission to achieve foundational literacy and numeracy for all students in the age group of 3 to 9 years needs to be launched immediately and implemented in the State. In this campaign, students, parents, schools, teachers and society as a whole need to take the initiative and strengthen the foundation of future education of all students in the state.
The Government of India has set a target of achieving foundational literacy and numeracy for every student by the year 2026-27 under the National Initiative for Proficiency in Reading with Understanding and Numeracy. A plan of action, a plan of action, and a plan of action are needed.
This requires development of curriculum and pedagogic materials (offline and online), learning competencies and learning outcomes, teacher empowerment, assessment techniques, etc. At present, students in classes 4th and 5th who have not acquired the basic skills are also required to provide individual guidance, group work with peer learners and age appropriate supplementary study material (in print and digital format) to acquire the required skills.

Need for Basic Literacy and Numeracy Mission in Maharashtra: The programme titled Advanced Education Maharashtra dated 22nd June, 2015 aims to ensure that every child who regularly attends schools in Maharashtra acquires basic learning abilities. The goal was that no child should be left behind in studies. The programme was well attended by the students, teachers and the management of the school. The programme was a huge success as per ASER reports of 2014, 2016 and 2018. However, the global pandemic of COVID 19 caused a great deal of disruption in the education of students.
According to a study conducted by UNESCO, 65% to 74% of the time of school education of students in India is wasted.
According to a survey conducted by Azim Premji University in September 2020, only 42% of children were able to attend online classes. Students were able to attend online classes. For them, this was not an ideal opportunity. Most of the teachers were able to teach one hour per class per day in online classes. More than 80% of teachers found it difficult to maintain emotional contact with students online and more than 90% found it impossible to effectively assess students' progress.
According to the Asian Development Bank 2021, school closures resulted in a 3.5% to 4.7% loss of future average earnings for children in 5 ASEAN countries (including India). South Asia lost 5% to 7% of its gross domestic product in 2020.
According to a survey, 6% of children are unlikely to return to school, in addition to the 3% who have already left school. (ASER 2019) 24 million more children will be missing from the education system after the pandemic. Therefore, in view of the present situation and the damage caused by the continuous closure of schools in the past, the foundation of education in the future must be" foundational education."
GOVERNMENT DECISIONS: The Government is approving and directing the implementation of the Foundational Literacy and Numeracy Mission under" NIPUN Bharat" in the State by 2026-27 for 100% students up to Class III to achieve foundational literacy and numeracy and for students who have progressed up to Class III but have not attained the desired competencies as under: 1. Linguistic Skills:- For early language development of students in the age group of 3 to 9 years, it is necessary to develop oral language knowledge, comprehension and comprehension in mother tongue, understanding and writing skills for development of typography and pronunciation.
A good knowledge of the language will help you develop your language skills. Students who have a strong mother tongue foundation can learn English or other languages more easily.

has been seen. For this, a new approach should be used to empower the students in the offline mode.
Parents play an important role in the upbringing of children. For this, the school and parents should provide a lot of printed material. Samagra Shiksha, STARS projects and local bodies will provide adequate provision for making reading materials and workbooks etc. widely available in schools and at home for faster reading, numeracy and literacy. The District Institute of Education and Training (DIET) and Gram Panchayats will be assisted by CSR and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) to prepare printed materials and practice charts and give them to the students. Computers and mobile phones should be used in education. However, the gap between students from remote areas and computer literate students has to be reduced.
Parents can be encouraged by making a list of activities that they can do regularly at home with their children, based on books of short stories from the school library, teaching learning materials. The following activities can be organized:
Some simple activities, reading labels, reading words from newspapers, notes, calendars as well as reading books, playing games, reciting songs and poems, saying things with appropriate voice fluctuations and interacting with children.
Parents who have access to printed materials and other learning materials and who have access to the Internet can guide their children by downloading the educational app on their mobile phones. Such computerized text is available for scanning through QR code from textbooks. WhatsApp-based lessons, online classes, and audio-visual tools on YouTube provided by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) and State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT) will be available to parents to gain strength in academic assessment. Similarly, parents should encourage children to use mass media, television, radio programmes and telephone interactions, reading aloud on loudspeakers (in groups of 2-3 children).
Village Education Boards at village/ mohalla/ habitation level will be constituted to improve reading, comprehension, writing and numeracy among children, so that discussions can be held among small groups of children and students at the higher secondary level/ graduate level in the village.
Self-learning can be promoted through peer learning and group learning (learning with siblings or close friends).
Empower parents to encourage and support participation of students in educational activities initiated at the state/ district level.
The ability to read fluently can be enhanced by using apps like Google Read Along, Pinterest, word matching games, etc. This will help students to improve their reading skills.
