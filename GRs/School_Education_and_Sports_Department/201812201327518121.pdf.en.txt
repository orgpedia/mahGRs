the prelude
The National Education Policy, 1986 and the Action Plan issued in pursuance thereof have laid emphasis on open education. Despite this, the important role of business-oriented distance education and open education has been repeatedly highlighted by many education experts and institutions. Many countries of the world have recognized the need for open education and have adopted the idea of open education.
The Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India, laid the foundation of Open Schooling in 1989 by creating an independent mechanism, the National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS).
At present, National Institute of Open Learning (NIO) has 11 Zonal Centres, 3 Sub-Divisional Centres, 3000 Affiliated Institutions (AIs) and Professional Institutions (AVIs) functioning across the country. The network of these 3000 study centers is spread across India, Nepal and the Middle East. However, considering the overall geographical coverage and regional requirements of the country, States need to make efforts at their own level and NIOS is providing encouragement and guidance to all States in this regard. At present, 15 States and 1 Union Territory have Open Schooling.
Education is the foundation of human thought. Education is a continuous process that touches every part of life and leads to perfection. Education plays an important role in improving the socio-economic status of people. Many schemes are being implemented by the government to ensure that every child in the society learns. However, many students are still deprived of education. Also, some students with disabilities are unable to pursue mainstream formal education.
It is necessary to provide highly advanced students with many subject options beyond formal education.
At present, it has been observed that the students of the state are being leaked at various stages in the educational journey from class 1 to class 10. The dropout rate of girls is also a symptom. Considering the situation, the government has taken the decision. Maharashtra State Open Board was established on 14th July 2017. The government has taken the decision. The matter of amending the policy dated July 14, 2017 was under consideration of the government.
