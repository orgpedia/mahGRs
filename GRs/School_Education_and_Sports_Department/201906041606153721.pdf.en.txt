If the above funds are not sufficient for free uniforms, the District Councils should be provided with funds from the funds under them. Under the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan, Rs. 600/- is given as subsidy and the scheme of free uniforms in 103 development blocks is already in operation. Rs 57 for boys and Rs 69 for girls. However, the amount is low, making it difficult for students in schools in 103 development blocks to get good quality and adequate uniforms. This will help in addressing the problems of 103 development groups if the respective Zila Parishads provide the required funds for uniforms from the funds under them.
