GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: PRAMA-2018/ PR No.73/ SM-4,
The Proposal:
The Cabinet in its meeting held on 30th August, 2016 has decided to revise the grant-in-aid formula to the extent of 20% of the total grant-in-aid to the recognized private primary and secondary schools, which have been declared eligible for grant-in-aid and permitted on' non-grant' and' permanent non-grant' basis. Accordingly, as per the Government Decision dated 19th September, 2016, a total of 20% subsidy was sanctioned to 19,247 teaching and non-teaching staff of 1,628 schools and 2,452 batches who were declared eligible for the subsidy before 14th June, 2016, subject to the prescribed terms and conditions.
The Cabinet in its meeting held on 17th April, 2018 has decided to grant 20% subsidy to the recognized private primary and secondary schools and class units, which have been approved on the basis of" permanent non-grant" and declared eligible for grant under the Government Decision dated 1st and 2nd July, 2016, until further orders of the Government.
Regarding the sanction of grants to some bogus and fake schools in the state which were declared eligible for grants as per the Government Decision, dated 1st and 2nd July, 2016. In Public Interest Litigation No. 03/ 2018 filed in the High Court, Aurangabad Bench, the Government clarified in the affidavit that a fresh decision will be taken on the sanction of grants to these schools after a thorough examination of these schools. Since the batches of 51 schools and 19 schools in the list accompanying the PIL are to be examined in detail and decided, the remaining schools and batches, excluding these schools, are to be considered under reference no. As per the decision of the Government here, dated May 9, 2018, a total of 20 percent subsidy was approved until further orders of the Government. Out of these 51 schools and 19 schools, 36 secondary schools and 11 secondary schools have been declared eligible for grant under the Government decision No. 13. The government was considering sanctioning grants to the remaining 11 schools and class units of 7 schools.
GOVERNMENT DECISIONS: Out of the 51 schools and 19 school class units which have been excluded as per the relevant Government decision, dated 9th May, 2018, the Commissioner (Education) has decided to provide additional seats to the students of Class No. A total of 29 teaching and 3 non-teaching posts including 5 teachers and 3 non-teaching staff of 1 secondary school and 24 teachers of 6 secondary school batches of Form-A and 3 non-teaching staff of Form-B, who have been found eligible in the report submitted by the Director of Education (Secondary and Higher Secondary) dated 16th February, 2019 along with the letter submitted to the Government through the letter hereunder, are being sanctioned 20% subsidy subject to the following terms and conditions from 1st April, 2018 till further orders of the Government.

Further, as per the report of the Director of Education (Secondary and Higher Secondary), the list of secondary schools/ batches which have been disqualified/ excluded is in Form-C along with the reasons therefor.
Terms and Conditions: 1) All the terms and conditions of the Government Decision dated 15th November, 2011 and dated 16th July, 2013 must be fulfilled. If it is found that the proposal of the schools which have not fulfilled the above conditions has been sent to the government to declare them eligible for the grant, then the responsibility of the concerned departmental deputy director of education and education officer will remain.
(2) The teaching and non-teaching posts sanctioned by the Government in the year in which direct grant is sanctioned to the said primary and secondary schools shall be eligible for grant.

Schools with less than 30 students in the last class and less than 20 students in the last class in hilly and remote areas will not be eligible for the grant. Since these schools do not fit into the grant eligibility criteria, such schools will be considered as" self-financed" schools.
5) Even if a school qualifies for the grant as per the norms of the Government Decision, dated 15th November, 2011, the grant will not be admissible to those schools which have not followed the" Reservation Policy" in respect of recruitment to the posts of teachers and non-teaching staff and such schools will be considered as" Self-financed" schools.
6) The school will not be eligible for the grant unless the personal recognition order with the Aadhaar card of all the teachers in the school is filled in the" Saral" system.
7) All teachers and non-teaching staff will be covered under the National Pension Scheme. Otherwise, the school will not be eligible for funding.

GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: PRAMA-2018/ PR No.73/ SM-4,
If it is decided, the school should be closed and the students of the school should be adjusted in the nearby school.
3.1 The Director of Education (Primary) and the Director of Education (Secondary and Higher Secondary) shall certify and inform all the concerned Education Officers (Primary and Secondary) about the fulfillment of the terms and conditions of paragraph 2 and the verification of all the documents of paragraph 3 in respect of the primary and secondary schools and units listed with this Government Decision.

3.3 If there are vacancies of teachers and non-teaching posts in these schools as per the norm, it will be mandatory to fill the posts in government and private aided primary and secondary schools by adjusting the existing policy of the government regarding accommodating the additional teachers and non-teaching staff.
4. Autonomy of Government:- A school declared eligible for grant-in-aid does not acquire the right to grant-in-aid. It is the" discretionary power" of the government to sanction grants to schools that have been declared eligible for grants and the government will decide on sanctioning grants to schools that are eligible for grants based on the availability of funds. This subsidy will not be applied retrospectively. Further, even if the schools are approved in any academic year on a non-grant basis, the government will change the grant formula taking into account the financial position of the state, financial resources available from time to time, needs of the state and their priorities.
This Government Resolution is being issued pursuant to the approval given by the Finance Department vide its Informal Reference No. 349/19/ Expenditure-5 dated 30th May, 2019.
