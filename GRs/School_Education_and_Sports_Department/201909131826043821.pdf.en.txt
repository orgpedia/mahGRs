Government Resolution, Department of School Education, No.Isaisha 1095/ (278/95)/ Mashi-8, dated 26th September, 1995 2) Government Resolution, Department of School Education, No.Isaisha 1001/ (185/2001)/ Mashi-7, dated 5th July, 2002 3) Government Resolution, Department of School Education, No.Isaisha-2006/ PR No.No.123/ Mashi-7, dated 24th December, 2007
The Proposal:
Considering the need for military education at the level of secondary and higher secondary education in the state, the government has decided to allow the opening of one military school in every district, competent and non-governmental organizations from 1996-97. 26.09.1995. The intake capacity of each batch was fixed at 40 students. Thereafter, as per the Government decision dated 5.7.2002, the intake capacity of students in each batch has been increased from 40 to 45.
In some Army schools, additional general or additional tribal batch has been sanctioned as more students have been admitted after completion of 45 marks.
Although the maximum strength of the troops in the Sub-Army School has been fixed at 45, the criteria for minimum strength in such additional (general/ tribal) units has not been decided. The matter was under consideration of the government.
The government has decided that the minimum number of students in the extra general batch and extra tribal batch in the state's private aided Sainik School will be 30.
In this regard, it is clarified that the minimum number of students in the sanctioned/ incoming additional (general/ tribal) batch for the students admitted after completion of 45 marks in the parent batch (general/ tribal) in the Sainik School will be 30.
