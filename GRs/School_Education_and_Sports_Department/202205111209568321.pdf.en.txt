The Proposal:
The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 has been in force in the State since April 2010. Every child has the right to a quality education. As the quality of education of children is continuously declining in various survey reports, the implementation of the Advanced Education Maharashtra program was started in the state from June 22, 2015. Accordingly, to enhance the academic quality of the students under this programme, it has been observed that the academic environment in the classroom is vibrant, joyful and constantly active, and the objectives of the students' curriculum are being achieved through practical learning materials instead of just focusing on listening in the classroom.
