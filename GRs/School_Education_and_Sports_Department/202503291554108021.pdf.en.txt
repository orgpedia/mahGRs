The Proposal: -
A 100% Centrally Sponsored "Minority Pre-Matric Scholarship Scheme" is implemented to encourage the educational attainment of the economically backward but meritorious students (Class 9th and 10th) of the Dhamik minority community and to stop their leakages at the school level.
Under the Centrally Sponsored Minority Pre-Matric Scholarship Scheme, contractual services have been made available through a local supplier private company finalised through e-tendering at the Directorate level. The services of 1 programmer, 2 data entry operators and 9 constables have been taken on contract basis. Under this scheme, funds have been received from the Central Government for the remuneration of contractual employees as well as administrative expenses of the Centrally Sponsored Minority Pre-Matric Scholarship Scheme up to the year 2018-19. Thereafter, no funds have been received for administrative expenses under the scheme during the period 2019-20 to 2023-24. Due to non-availability of funds, the contractual employees under the schemes are facing difficulties in payment of honorarium and smooth implementation of the schemes.
Central Government Reference No. 2 here. According to the letter dated 25.08.2022, the amount spent by the state government on the year 2022-23 and thereafter on the official and administrative aspects of the scheme will be reimbursed by the central government to the state government.

Accordingly, for the services of contractual staff in the office of the Director of Education (Planning), Pune for the implementation of the Centrally Sponsored Pre-Matric Scholarship Scheme in the financial year 2024-25, a sum of Rs. 10 lakh was under consideration of the government.
