Many new projects have been launched in the last 10-20 years. The Government of India has extended the Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya Scheme till the 12th standard.
(3) In view of the above existing schemes and their consequent duplication and the present situation creating new requirements (e.g. increasing electricity bills of schools, rent of school buildings, requirement of computer labs, science labs, sanitary houses for students, water supply etc.), it is imperative to restructure the schemes mentioned in the above table.
The Central Government has launched the Performance Grade Index Scheme to determine the educational ranking of all the states of the country from 2017, under which the above-mentioned items have been given priority.
In view of the above, the matter of implementing the new scheme by superseding the old scheme and the government decisions issued accordingly under the District Annual Plan was under the consideration of the government.
Further, it has become necessary to use the funds from the District Annual Plan for this purpose as it is not possible to provide adequate funds for the necessary needs from the state level budget received by the School Education and Sports Department. Approximately Rs. More than Rs 11,000 crore has been allocated for this. Among them it is easily possible to allocate certain funds for the necessary matters related to school education. Accordingly, it is proposed to permanently reserve for the District Annual (General) Plans by the Planning Department in each district, such funds for the schemes related to school education (excluding sports related schemes) up to a minimum of 5% of the total outlay to the District Planning Committee. Cabinet of Ministers The resolution was submitted to the meeting held on 20/04/2022.
The proposal In pursuance of the decision taken by the Cabinet, it was under consideration of the Government to restructure the existing schemes of the Department of School Education and Sports (excluding Sports Scheme) and to provide funds to the extent of at least 5% of the total outlay of the District Annual (General) Plan every year (excluding Mumbai and Mumbai Suburban Districts) for the same and to implement the same from the financial year 2022-23.
