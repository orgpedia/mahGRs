To bring uniformity and consistency in the duration of schools across the state, it was under consideration to take a decision at the government level regarding the summer vacation of 2022 and the opening of schools in the upcoming academic year 2022-23.
(a) On Monday. The period of this holiday has been extended to Sunday with effect from May 2, 2022. It will be held on the second Monday of the next academic year 2022-23. The school will open on June 13, 2022. Also, considering the temperature of Vidarbha in the month of June, the school there will be open on the fourth Monday after the summer vacation. It will begin on June 27, 2022.
The results of classes 1 to 9 and 11 can be declared on or after April 30, 2022, during the vacation period, however, the responsibility of communicating the result to the students/ parents will remain with the concerned school.
