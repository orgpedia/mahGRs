Introduction: Dahi Handi festival is held on a large scale every year in the state. The court, administration and other agencies have repeatedly observed that there is a threat to human towers during the Dahi Handi festival. However, since it is important to maintain tradition to celebrate Lokotsav, many Govinda teams participate in it. Accidents often occur while participating in the Dahi Handi festival. At times, the Govindas in the team meet with an accidental death or serious injury, putting their lives in danger. As a result, these Govindas and their families have to spend the rest of their lives in financial hardship. Accordingly, the matter of insuring the Govindas, who participated in the Dahi Handi festival in the state and built human towers, and providing them financial protection and paying the insurance premium for it from the government is being examined at the government level. However, with the Dahi Handi festival just around the corner, there is very little time for the proceedings to be carried out. So that's 2022. The matter of financial assistance to Govinda was under consideration of the government if he met with an accident while erecting human towers during the Dahi Handi festival on August 19, 2022.
