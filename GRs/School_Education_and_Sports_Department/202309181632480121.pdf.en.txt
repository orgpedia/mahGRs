Introduction: Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan has been implemented across the country since 2000-2001. As per the decision of the School Education and Sports Department dated 18.1.2002, it was decided to implement the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan in the state and the responsibility of implementing this campaign was handed over to the Maharashtra Primary Education Council, Mumbai. The society is registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860 and Bombay Trust Act, 1950. Samagra Shiksha, a Centrally Sponsored Scheme for School Education, has been launched by the Government of India since 2018-19 as an integrated scheme for imparting quality and quality education by converging the flagship schemes of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan and Teacher Education. The Government of India has approved the continuation of Samagra Shiksha from 01.04.2021 to 31.03.2026.
As per Rule 37 (Management Cost) of the Manual on Financial Management and Procurement, 2004 issued by the Ministry of Human Resource Development, New Delhi, for the implementation of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, no new posts should be created while sanctioning posts under Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and the posts created should be filled only on contract or on deputation. The filling up of these posts should not result in permanent liability on the society or the state government. The contractual employees are entitled to remuneration at the unit rate approved by the Central Government. There are a total of 6251 employees working in 64 state level offices and 6187 in district level offices. The proposal to increase the salary of these employees has not been approved by the central government, so the state government will have to bear the cost. Therefore, a proposal to increase the remuneration of contractual employees working under Samagra Shiksha by 10 per cent was under consideration of the government.
