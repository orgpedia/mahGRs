Reference No. The Central Government has developed a revised framework for the implementation of the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Samagra Shiksha under the Semi-Governmental Letter No. 2. The framework envisages the concept of a Cluster Resource Centre (CRC) to act as an educational resource centre. The objectives of the cluster resource centre for the cluster schools are summarized as follows: -
Educational support: - To assist teachers in improving teaching methods by providing hands-on demonstrations, exchange of teaching-learning materials, and solving problems related to the subject.

Key points: - To act as a link between the school and the school management committees, the school B group level system.
5. Resources: - Providing access to educational materials (TLM), reference books and information technology for teachers.
In short, Community Resource Centres have a critical role to play in the effective implementation of the National Education Policy, 2020, as the ultimate mechanism for quality and action-based inclusive learning as well as end-to-end support to teachers for their continued professional development.

However, the number of students attending private aided / partially aided / unaided schools in the state is 50 TAHT more. The government's goal policies, schemes, and orders need to be implemented equally effectively in the primary and secondary schools of this management.
