Preamble: In order to streamline the online admission process for Class 11th from the academic year 2020-2021, the Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has decided to conduct online admission test for Class 11th. The Government decision has been issued on 23.06.2020.
The admission process for the year 2021-22 has been started in the month of August 2021 due to the cancellation of the Class 10 examination and the decision regarding the Common Entrance Test scheduled for the admission process of Class 11 due to the extraordinary situation arising out of the outbreak of COVID-19. The admission process for the academic session 2021-22 is going on.
As per the High Court order, the admission process has to be completed within the stipulated time.
The first-come-first-serve (FCFS) round was cancelled as per the decision of the government in the context and the process of additional special rounds was to be adopted instead. However, at the end of the special round, it has been observed that the admission rate is getting delayed rather than increasing and many students are still left without admission.
In view of the above, it was considered by the Government to conduct the First Come First Served (FCFS) round instead of the traditional rounds in the last phase of admission process for this year's Class XI admissions.
The government has decided to conduct the first-come-first-serve (FCFS) rounds for the next phase of the online admission process in all recognized higher secondary schools/ junior colleges in the Mumbai-Thane and Raigad districts, Mumbai Metropolitan Development Authority (MMRDA), Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporations, Nagpur Municipal Corporation, Amravati Municipal Corporation and Nashik Municipal Corporation.
