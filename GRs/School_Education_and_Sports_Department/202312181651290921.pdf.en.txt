Introduction: Under the Pradhan Mantri Poshan Shakti Nirman Yojana, cooks and helpers are working in various schools of the state on honorarium basis to provide nutritional benefits to the students. Cooks and helpers are appointed by the school management committee. Cooks and helpers will be paid Rs. Rs. 2500/-. The government gave the decision to the cooks and helpers. The business has to be carried out as mentioned in paragraph 9 of February 02, 2011. The task is to keep the school and its surroundings clean. Cooks and helpers' trade unions are expressing dissatisfaction over this work as it is in addition to the work related to the scheme. In this regard, the government has been receiving representations from the association of cooks and helpers from time to time and it is being demanded not to give any other work other than the scheme and not to reduce the cooks and helpers from work unnecessarily. Accordingly, the matter of ensuring the work of cooks and helpers working under the scheme was under the consideration of the government.
