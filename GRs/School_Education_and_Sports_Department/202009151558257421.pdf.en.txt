It will take some time to correct these errors. However, if the temporary posts are not extended, the problem of salary of the official employees arises.

The establishment-wise details in this regard are given in Form A and Form B.
Commissioner, Education, Maharashtra State, Pune and all the offices under him and all the Divisional Deputy Director of Education offices should take care to attach the office-wise and post-wise statements of the posts in his office while submitting the salary payments of the temporary posts.
