The state government's departments of tribal development, social justice and special assistance, other backward Bahujan welfare, minority development, skill development and entrepreneurship, school education and sports, higher and technical education, medical education and pharmaceuticals, and women and child development implement various schemes of nutrition, various concessions and personal benefits. Therefore, the Department was contemplating to take measures to ensure that the children and other disadvantaged sections of the society are brought into the mainstream of the various schemes of the welfare state and no eligible beneficiary is left out, so that the schemes of nutrition, various concessions and personal benefits reach the eligible beneficiaries in a transparent manner.
Under the Department of School Education and Sports, various scholarship schemes are implemented for students, 25% admission process for weaker, disadvantaged sections under the Right to Education Act, as well as individual benefits. It has been decided at the Government level to take measures to ensure that various schemes of concessions and individual benefits reach the eligible beneficiaries in a transparent manner as follows: 1) A scheme-wise database of all the beneficiaries of the schemes being implemented by the Department of School Education and Sports should be created and linked to Aadhaar. It will be mandatory to complete the process of linking the names of all the beneficiaries with Aadhaar cards related to these schemes by the end of December, 2022. All the beneficiaries of these schemes should be linked to Aadhaar from 1.1.2023 onwards.
The registration and regular attendance of all students in schools and junior colleges should be done through a web-based application and the process of updating its Master Data Base should be done by the end of December, 2022.
Under each scheme, the funds for the respective schemes should be disbursed from 1.1.2023 as per the daily attendance record by keeping the Aadhaar-linked Master Data Base of the beneficiary students updated.
