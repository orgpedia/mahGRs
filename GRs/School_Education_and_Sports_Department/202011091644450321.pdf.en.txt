Also, detailed information should be collected about the utilization of the grants distributed by the government to these institutions and where the unutilized amount is kept. If the unaccounted money is kept in the bank, then its bank account statement should be submitted to the government. If the funds made available for expenditure on a programme are unutilized, the funds should not be released for the same purpose in the current year without the approval of the Finance Department.
12. While drawing the payments of beneficiaries under the individual beneficiary programme, the grants of individual beneficiaries shall not be drawn unless the list of beneficiaries is fixed and linked with the payment with proper details. The programmes of individual beneficiaries should be linked with Aadhaar number and the subsidy should be disbursed through Electronic Clearance System (ECS).

The Department concerned shall ensure receipt of funds from the Central Government in respect of the Centrally Sponsored Scheme from the Finance Branch of the Finance Department on receipt (no need to refer the funds to the Expenditure/ Budget Branch) and thereafter, if the funds have been received, the administrative department shall disburse the same to the State Government at their level.

However, if the funds of the Central Government for the previous year are to be spent in the current year, it will be mandatory to obtain the consent of the Planning, Tribal Development Department and Social Justice and Special Assistance Department as well as the Finance Department, as the case may be.
