Madam Cama Marg, Hutatma Rajguru Chowk,
Ministry, Mumbai- 400 032.
Date: 23rd of June 2022.
Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009.
(2) The Government shall take steps to ensure that out of school children are admitted to regular schools and their attendance is maintained. 28th March 2013.
Government Resolution No. 4415/ (102)/ 15/ S.D. 4, Department of School Education. 20th of May 2015.
4) Government Resolution No. 21/ SD-4, dated February 23, 2021.
Introduction: Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009. It came into effect on April 1, 2010. Under this Act, every child between the age of 6 and 14 years has the right to be enrolled in school, to attend regular school and to receive quality education.
Children who have never attended school, children who have not attended school (E1), or children between the ages of 6 and 14 who have not completed elementary education after admission, are considered to be out of school (E2) if they are absent for more than one month. There is no denying the fact that many children in the state are still out of school for various reasons.
A large number of families have migrated from many districts of Maharashtra during the last 2 years of the Corona epidemic. Migrant families are from economically weaker sections of society, landless or marginalized. A large number of these families migrate to western Maharashtra's Solapur, Kolhapur, Pune, Satara, Ahmednagar and neighbouring states of Karnataka and Gujarat to harvest sugarcane. The migration period is from September to May. Apart from this, these families migrate for jobs in brick kilns, stone quarries, coal mines, agricultural labor, construction business, public works department, as well as for roads, drains, ginning mills. In order to ensure that the education of such migrant, out-of-school children does not stop, a special search campaign was launched in March 2021 in Maharashtra to enroll out-of-school, irregular and migrant children in the school stream. But due to the outbreak of Covid, the search operation could not be completed effectively in all parts of the state as the schools in the state were not running at full capacity.

GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.
Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, schools have been shut down and regular classes have been disrupted. Even though the central and state governments provide for the regular education of children
They try not to go to school. And yet, there are many challenges.
There are fears that the increasing migration will lead to an increase in the number of out-of-school boys and even girls. Uncertainty over employment, social insecurity and fear among parents pose a challenge to curb the rising child labour and child marriage rates. In this situation, the challenges for children with disabilities are increasing. Even in such a situation, it is the top priority of the state to ensure that 100 percent children are enrolled in the school stream and all their rights are fulfilled. Therefore, it is necessary for all government departments to work together with proper planning and control.
For this, the government was considering to take up an ambitious mission in collaboration with other departments including the education department. The government has taken the following decisions:
Government's decision
A State level survey on" Mission Zero Dropout for school dropouts, irregular and migrant children" was conducted in March 2021 and earlier also. 100% of the children in the study were not enrolled in school. Some of the children had even dropped out of school. Therefore, the survey is being undertaken for the first time after the outbreak of the Corona epidemic. The survey was conducted to identify eligible students and admit them to the school.
The main objective of this mission is to continue quality education and reduce child wasting to zero. Mission Zero Dropout should be widely implemented from 5th July to 20th July 2022 to prevent children from dropping out of school. The state government has approved the implementation of this mission with the participation of officials from the departments of Revenue, Rural Development, Urban Development, Social Justice and Special Assistance, Women and Child Development, Labour Department, Tribal Development, Minority Development Department and Public Health and Home Department.
