Department of School Education and Sports, Government Resolution No. 2022/ No. 216/ SD-4, dated 02.03.2023.
Introduction: Education and learning materials should be universalized, reaching every student.
The increasing weight of textbooks and books has led to an increase in the burden of textbooks, the increasing weight of textbooks has an adverse effect on the health of students, and at the same time, the children of poor farmers in the villages of the state do not have enough writing materials to go to school. All these issues were discussed with educationists, teachers, officials of the State Council of Educational Research and Training, State Board of Examinations and Bal Bharati. After a thorough discussion by these experts, considering the above results, positive feedback has been received about adding pages of books in the textbook of the students.
Experts have suggested that one to two pages (one page) should be included in each textbook after the lesson/ poem as per the requirement, including all the subjects of all the mediums to be prepared by the Maharashtra State Textbook Board as well as the semi-English medium of these mediums. From all the above discussions, it was under the consideration of the government to take a decision to add one to two pages of the booklet at the end of each component/ lesson/ poem in the textbooks. Orders issued in this regard are being revised.
Government Decision: Integrated text books in four parts with the pages of the books will be made available to the students in all the government schools in the states in a pilot form from the academic year 2023-24. The scheme will be applicable for all textbooks of classes II to VIII.
In these textbooks, one to two pages (one page) of text will be added at the end of each component/ lesson/ poem. Students on these pages learn while the teacher teaches/ continues teaching in the classroom.

Important topics such as semantics, important formulas, important addresses, important sentences, notes, etc. are expected to be recorded. It is not required to record dictation/ correct writing.
These pages of the textbook are required to be used by children under the heading My notes, which will be made on these pages of what the teacher actually teaches in the school. This will help you understand the level of class work. Corrections can be made where necessary.
Children will be allowed to keep separate books for practice, class work, homework, etc. in addition to the questions given in the textbooks.
Since adding pages of books to textbooks will increase the size, weight and cost of books, the following procedure should be implemented in this regard.
For the students studying in all government schools, local bodies schools, government and aided and partially aided schools in the state, the textbooks for classes 2nd to 8th should be prepared in an integrated form divided into a total of 4 parts and each component/ lesson/ poem should be included in it after 1 page of the booklet as per the need.
Class 1 textbooks should also be prepared in a total of 4 parts and pages should be included for practice as per requirement.
Regular textbooks should be made available to students of classes 2nd to 8th in private and unaided schools. The text books should be made available in total 4 parts after the balance stock of regular textbooks with the Text Book Board and the stock with the bookseller is exhausted. Books should also be included in this section.
The compulsory subjects in textbooks for students should be divided into a total of 4 parts. However, books in the category and optional subjects should be made available separately.
Instead of including textbooks of grades and elective subjects in 4 parts, separate textbooks should be made available as per the demand of students/ parents/ vendors and government schemes.
The increase in the price of paper will affect the price of textbooks. Therefore, all the textbooks supplied under the Samagra Shiksha scheme and in the open market are according to the evaluation formula approved by the Board's Regulatory Board.

The prices of the books should be fixed according to the new assessment and these textbooks should be made available in 4 parts.
7. Adding pages of books in textbooks as above will affect the cost of textbooks. This will increase the cost of textbooks. The Maharashtra State Primary Education Council, Mumbai, will reimburse the increased price so that the burden of this increased price does not fall on the textbook board.
In view of the success of the present scheme, this scheme should be continued from the school year 2024-25.
In order to reimburse the expenditure on the above, the State Project Director, Samagra Shiksha shall make necessary provision in the Annual Plan and Budget (AWP& B) of the Centrally Sponsored Samagra Shiksha Yojana and submit a proposal to the State Government for additional funds.
