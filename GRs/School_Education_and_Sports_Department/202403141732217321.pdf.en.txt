Preamble: - Non-teaching staff in primary, upper primary, secondary and higher secondary schools run by private institutions in the state are not covered under the Promised Progress Scheme under the revised service.
The Department of School Education implemented a time-bound promotion scheme for non-teaching staff of recognised private aided schools in the state payable after 12 years with a difference, with effect from the date of 30.4.1998 and the date of 23.7.1998 with effect from the date of 1.10.1994 with the approval of the Cabinet.
The Government Decision dated 1.4.2010 of the Department of Finance amends the Guaranteed Progress Scheme under the Service to introduce the Guaranteed Progress Scheme under the Revised Service to Government employees. It issued an order to allow the benefits of the Progress Scheme guaranteed under the revised service to state government employees after 12 years and 24 years of regular service. Also, the scheme has been made applicable to stand-alone posts in State Government employees after 12 years and 24 years of service as per Government Decision dated 5.7.2010.
There have been several discussions in the legislature regarding the demand for implementation of the revised Guaranteed Progress Scheme for state government employees for non-teaching staff as the scheme does not automatically apply to non-teaching staff of a recognised school in the state. Also, many non-teaching staff unions are insisting on this demand.
Sarvashri Hiralal Pipariye and 10 others, working as Junior Clerk and Sepoy in a Government recognized private school, had filed Writ Petition No. 8985/2013 in Bombay High Court, Aurangabad Bench. In this case, Mr. The High Court dated 19.08.2014 has ordered to expedite the process of implementing the revised Assured Progress Scheme for non-teaching staff in private institutions in the state.
