the amount of licence fee payable on revised pay in respect of teaching and non-teaching staff residing in Government accommodation;
Adjustment of any government receipts from teachers and non-teaching staff for the period from 1st January, 2016 to 31st December, 2018;

For this, the previous provident fund account number given to the subscriber will be used. Since the amount cannot be withdrawn for 2 years from the date of actual deposit, the amount will be kept separate from the regular provident fund account.
For example, if the first instalment of arrears (for FY 2019) was deposited in the Provident Fund in March, 2020, the period of moratorium on withdrawal would end on 28.02.2022 and if the instalment of arrears from FY 2020 was deposited in the Provident Fund in July, 2020, the period of moratorium on withdrawal would end on 30.06.2022 and the same would be applicable for subsequent instalments.

(e) in the case of employees whose service has been terminated on account of retirement or otherwise, after depositing one or more instalments of arrears in the provident fund account, the amount of arrears accumulated in their regular provident fund transfer.
The amount should be paid as per the prevailing procedure. In such cases, the amount of the remaining instalments to be deposited in the Provident Fund (if any) shall be paid in cash in the remaining years in the same instalment after deducting/ adjusting the amounts mentioned in clauses (a) and (b) above.

In the payment of salary the amount of arrears of the relevant year should be demanded as a separate matter.
In the statement attached to the salary payment, the installment number of the dues along with the amount due in cash should be clearly shown in red ink.
