The Proposal:
Some candidates from the state have cleared the Union Public Service Commission's civil services examination from the Other Backward Classes. His parents are working as teachers in a private 100 per cent aided school. Since the post of a teacher in a private 100 per cent aided school has not been declared equivalent to the post of a teacher in government service, those teachers have not yet been inducted into the civil service as they do not get the benefit of Other Backward Classes.
Private school employees are not considered government employees.

The provisions of Government Decision No. 2022/ No. 03/ TNT-1 of 1981 are applicable. However, the rules and conditions of service for employees of private aided schools are determined by the state government. In respect of matters not provided for in the Maharashtra Private Schools Employees (Conditions of Service) Rules, 1981, the relevant provisions of the Maharashtra Civil Services Rules are made applicable to the employees of private aided schools.
Considering the above background, the matter of declaring both the posts of teachers in private 100% aided schools and teachers in government service as equivalent was under consideration of the government.
Government's decision:
For the purpose of ensuring non-criminal reservation only in respect of teachers in private 100% aided schools and teachers in government service, the posts of teachers in private 100% aided schools and teachers in government service shall be deemed to be equivalent to the posts of government employees concerned.
