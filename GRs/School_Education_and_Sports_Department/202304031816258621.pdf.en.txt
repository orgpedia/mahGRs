However, the transferable officers should submit the information of the preferred course in the prescribed format as per the return-1 to the Commissioner of Education without fail by April 6, 2023. The Office of the Commissioner of Education should submit the consolidated information along with the order of preference to the Department of School Education by April 11, 2023.
Group B officers under this department who have submitted request forms in the past will not be considered. Also, officers who do not give preference to the Commissioner of Education by April 11, 2023, will be given posting as per the urgency to fill up the vacant posts in the administration. Also, such officers will not be able to apply for premature transfer till the period of posting is over. Also, applications submitted by such officers will not be considered.
The officers who will specify the priority will have to attach proof of certificates and documents issued by the competent authority. If these evidences are not attached, the priority of such officers will not be taken into account. Also, while specifying the preferred order of preference, if the Revenue Department Allotment Rules are applicable to the concerned officer, such officer shall submit the preference order considering the vacancies in the Revenue Department allotted to them. Preference given to transferable officers outside the revenue division allotted to them as per the Revenue Division Allotment Rules shall not be taken into consideration.
As the proposal for promotion/ direct recruitment in the department is under consideration, there is a possibility of change in the list of vacancies and transferable officers.
