The Proposal:
The National Cadet Corps was established in 1948-49 and the National Cadet Corps Act, 1948 was enacted to provide for the formation of the National Cadet Corps. Various allowances are given by the central and state governments for the National Student Army Scheme. After the rates of these allowances are increased from time to time by the central government, the state government is also expected to increase accordingly. However, in the last few years, various difficulties have arisen in the payment of these allowances due to lack of such a government decision. Accordingly, the State Government has increased the allocation for the Rashtriya Chhatra Sena Scheme, which was earlier given by the Central Government vide letter dated 21st May, 2013. It has been implemented under the order dated 18/08/2018. Now the central government. The Commission's July 12, 2018
