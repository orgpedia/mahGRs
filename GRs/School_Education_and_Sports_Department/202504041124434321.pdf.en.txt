The Proposal: -
Reference No. 2 As per the Government decision here, the revised pattern has been implemented for non-teaching staff in recognised private partially / fully aided secondary and higher secondary schools in the State. As per this Government decision, the following regular posts have been sanctioned in the Non-Teaching Cadre on the basis of student strength.
1. Junior scribe 2. Senior scribe 3. Chief scribe 4. Full-time librarian 5. Laboratory assistant
Reference No. The posts of Class IV staff in private partially / fully-aided secondary and higher secondary schools recognised under Section 3 have been abolished and "sepoy allowance" has been made admissible instead. Although the posts of Class IV employees have lapsed in such schools, the employees who were working with regular appointment since before the date of this Government decision will continue to work till their retirement. Senior Scribe and Chief Scribe among the above posts.

The provision for appointment by promotion only is provided under Schedule "B" of the Maharashtra Private Schools Employees (Conditions of Service) Rules 1981. Therefore, it is customary to be appointed to that position only by promotion. As the recruitment for the posts of Junior Scribe, Laboratory Assistant and Librarian is not fixed, taking into account the general principles laid down by the Department of General Administration and Department of Finance, Reference No. The letter at 4 had approved the appointment to the post of junior scribe by a promotion to the rank of 50:50 by nomination with the principle of B Compassion. However, due to the abolition of the posts of Class IV employees as mentioned above and the unavailability of candidates in the lower cadre, there are difficulties in filling the posts of junior scribes by promotion. Hence, the government has received several representations to approve 100 per cent direct recruitment of these posts. The Divisional Commissioners (Backward Classes Cell) of various departments are also asking how to check the mark sheets submitted by various agencies in this regard. If the post of non-teaching staff remains vacant, the teachers have to do the work. This fact cannot be denied. Administrative correspondence, archival preservation, library management, laboratory routine, etc., are also required by teachers on occasion, which in turn affects teaching and academic quality. Considering all these factors, a proposal to revise the appointment ratio for some posts in the non-teaching cadre was under consideration of the government.
The Government's Decisions:
Government approval is being granted to fill up the following cadre posts in recognized Private Partial / Fully Aided Secondary and Higher Secondary Schools in the State with Compassionate AAAS Yoo percentage of nominations.
1. Junior Scribe 2. Full-time Librarian 3. Laboratory Assistant
The above approval is being granted subject to the following conditions: -
1. Reference No. 1 Provisions have been made under the Government Decision regarding the grant of compassionate appointments to the teaching and non-teaching staff of private recognised schools on a patrimonial basis. These provisions should be strictly adhered to. As per the order of the High Court, Reference No. 5 are given below. For this reason, it should be taken into account that when filling these positions with 100% direct service, it involves a path of compassionate appointment.
2. Reference No. 3 It is likely that the staff employed in the regular appointment to the rank of Class IV will still be working before the Government Decision here is issued. It is also likely that some of these employees are holding the necessary qualifications to be promoted to the above position. In such a situation, according to the prevailing system, these posts need to be filled by promotion within a limit of 50 per cent.

3. While submitting the point list for 100% direct recruitment to the posts under the proposal to the authority concerned for certification, it shall be necessary to submit along with the point list record, as the case may be, a certificate of the fact that no employee is working in the Class IV cadre or that any of the working Class IV employees does not possess the requisite qualification for promotion or that the qualified working Class IV employee is not desirous of promotion.
4. All Divisional Commissioners (Backward Classes Cell) are hereby informed that no further action shall be taken unless the appropriate certificate mentioned in paragraph 2 is furnished by the institution under the proposal which will also submit the point list registers for inspection with 100% direct service.
5. Paragraph No. As mentioned in section 3, the organization management will be required to submit the appropriate certificate along with the registration form on their own responsibility. If complaints are received with this department or other competent authority due to wrong certificate submission and the recruitment process is hampered or court cases arise, the management of the institution concerned will be solely responsible for the same.
6. The first phase of teacher recruitment based on the marks obtained in Teacher Aptitude and Efficiency Test 2022 has been completed and the second phase has become operational. The recruitment for this post was approved with a ceiling of 80% of the total vacancies. On the same lines, the condition of 80 per cent of the total vacancies will also be applicable to the posts which have been conditionally approved to be filled with 100 per cent direct service under this order.
7. The Deputy Director of Education / Education concerned shall take action to approve such appointments by ensuring that the posts sanctioned as aforesaid are filled up in accordance with the procedure prescribed by the Government and that all the conditions and conditions mentioned in this order are complied with at the time of recruitment.
