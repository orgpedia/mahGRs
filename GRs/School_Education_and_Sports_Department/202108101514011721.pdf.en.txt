But the health and safety of students is a priority and the school education department is constantly pushing for online education. Over the past year, efforts have been made to reach every child through various means. But it cannot be ignored that given the disparity in economic, social, technological (lack of tabs, smart phones, etc.), there is a need for offline-online learning to reach the last-mile learner. Along with online education, offline education should also be started.
According to the World Health Organization and UNICEF, long periods of time away from school can have far-reaching effects on students' learning abilities. Due to the closure of schools, children have been sitting at home for a year and due to this, they are suffering from physical, psychological stress and side effects. This should not be ignored.
As time goes on, it will become more difficult to recover. In some schools, students were deprived of education due to lack of electricity and internet facility. Last year, due to the long lockdown, the teaching and learning process was disrupted. Child marriage, increasing child labour, drop-out rate of girls/ boys, and household farm work are likely to cause large-scale social harm.

The findings are significant as the fourth sero-survey also included children in the age group of 6 to 17 years. The survey found that 57.2 per cent of children aged six to nine in the country have developed antibodies.
