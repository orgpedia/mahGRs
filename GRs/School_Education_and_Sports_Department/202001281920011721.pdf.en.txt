The old works should be reviewed and completed on priority and the funds should not be provided to the Public Works Department in the form of deposit construction.
The Department concerned shall ensure receipt of funds from the Central Government in respect of the Centrally Sponsored Scheme from the Finance Branch of the Finance Department on receipt (no need to refer the funds to the Expenditure/ Budget Branch) and thereafter, if the funds have been received, the administrative department shall disburse the same to the State Government at their level. There is no need to refer the fee separately to the Finance Department for concurrence. However, if the funds of the Central Government from the previous year are to be spent in the current year, it will be mandatory to obtain the consent of the Planning, Tribal Development and Social Justice and Special Assistance Department as well as the Finance Department, as the case may be.
