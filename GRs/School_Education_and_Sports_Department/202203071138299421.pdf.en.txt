There have been movements all over the world for equal rights for women in the socio-political space. Many individuals, organizations, systems of government and all sections of society have created many movements from time to time to empower women in the face of adverse circumstances and many problems.
Today, women are at the forefront in every field. In this journey of struggle, many laws have been made for women and their rights and their implementation is also being seen effectively.
