""" Introduction: With regard to providing\"" free\"" education to only two batches of full-time teaching and non-teaching staff of aided non-government secondary schools and higher secondary schools in the State at all levels of education (from Class 1 to Post-Graduate level) from the academic year 1995-96 on par with the batches of primary teachers, vide Reference No.""" (1) It is hereby approved by the Government. The title of the article also uses the word" free education." The word" free" seems to have been misused in the scheme and in the title. This has led to confusion among the teachers. The approval has been granted subject to the conditions, provisions and rules mentioned in the Annexure accompanying this Government Decision. According to Rule No.
(5) stipulates the conditions for eligibility for the" free" education concession. Rule No. 5 (2) provides that the concession in respect of professional courses shall be admissible only to students admitted to the" Free Seat" in a recognized institution and the students eligible for this scheme shall be eligible for admission to the same in accordance with the provisions of the Rules issued by the Director of Education (Secondary and Higher Secondary), vide Reference No. (2) In this letter, Rs. 3000/- to Rs. There are clear instructions that the benefit will be given at the prescribed rate of Rs.8000/-. This means that the concession is not for" free" or" free" education, but for fee concession as per the fixed government rates.
Despite this, it has been observed that the government is burdened with more expenses due to some beneficiaries going to court. As a result, the government will incur huge expenditure on this scheme. This scheme is for full/ full fee waiver or reimbursement.
