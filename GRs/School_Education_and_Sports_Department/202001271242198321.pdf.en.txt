Every child between the ages of 6 and 14 has the right to quality education. Various survey reports have consistently shown a decline in the quality of education of children. Accordingly, the implementation of the Advanced Education Maharashtra program was started in the state as per the government decision dated June 22, 2015. To enhance the quality of education, the classroom environment should be vibrant and keep the children constantly active. The classroom should be an environment that encourages them to think and nurtures their inventive spirit, to innovate and use it, to create opportunities for action. Also, it is important to give children the opportunity to engage in activities that encourage curiosity and stimulate thinking through hands-on activities, rather than just focusing on listening in the classroom. So that the children can be helped to consolidate the concept of science, they can enjoy self-creation.
