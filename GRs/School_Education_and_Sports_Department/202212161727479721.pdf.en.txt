The Proposal:
Earlier, the selection of teachers in primary schools of local bodies in the state was done through a centralised pre-recruitment selection test, while teachers in private schools were appointed by the respective private managements through a process laid down under the provisions of the Maharashtra Private Schools Employees (Conditions of Service) Act, 1977. However, as per the provisions of the said Government Order, at present, the vacant posts of teachers in private aided/ partially aided, unaided and declared eligible for grant-in-aid in primary, upper primary, secondary and higher secondary schools/ junior colleges, including local bodies in the State (except schools run by self-financing, minority institutions and permanent unaided schools of English medium) are being filled up through a computer system called' Pavitra" on the basis of marks obtained in aptitude and IQ tests.
However, in case of appointment of a working regular teacher to a higher/ unequal post despite being selected through nomination/ competitive selection process by obtaining higher qualification, there will be no protection of pay. 3 The condition in the government decision here makes it disadvantageous for such a teacher to accept such a new appointment as the benefit of the previous service is not available at the time of the new appointment. Therefore, the public representatives were demanding that the salary of such regular working teacher should be protected if he is selected through nomination/ competitive selection process and accepts a new appointment.
The government has taken the decision. Term/ Condition No. 15/9/2011 3 has been amended to provide for appointment of regular working teachers through nomination/ competitive selection process on par with each other (primary to primary, secondary to secondary, high school/ junior college to high school/ junior college) and higher/ unequal (primary to secondary or higher secondary/ junior college or secondary to higher secondary school/ junior college).

The matter of providing protection to the salary of the previous post of such teacher in case of a new appointment to the post was under the consideration of the government.
Government's decision:
The following conditions will be applicable while protecting the previous salary of a teacher who has been newly appointed to the post of regular teacher through nomination/ competitive selection process in the same post (Primary to Primary, Secondary to Secondary, Higher Secondary School/ Junior College to Higher Secondary School/ Junior College) as well as in the higher/ unequal post (Primary to Secondary or Higher Secondary/ Junior College or Secondary to Higher Secondary School/ Junior College):
(1) The previous appointment in the local body or private school should have been made through the prescribed route/ process.
(2) The previous appointment should have been personally approved from time to time and should have received a salary grant.
(3) If the previous appointment has not been made in the prescribed manner/ procedure, the previous salary of the teacher working in the regular pay scale will not be protected in case of fresh appointment. However, the government decided to. As the Shiksha Sevak Scheme will not be applicable to such teacher as on 15/09/2011, his salary will be fixed at the minimum level of pay scale applicable to the newly appointed post.
(4) There shall be no protection of salary if there is a break in service between the previous service and the new appointment.
However, after demitting office from the earlier post, a reasonable period of time will be permissible as per the prevailing policy for joining the new post.
(5) Salary protection shall not be applicable for transfer to similar or higher post.
(6) If the pay scale of the new post selected with the other management is the same as that of the previous management, the service superiority of the previous post shall not apply to the employee.
However, the benefit of superannuation/ selection will be payable by retaining the services of the previous post.
(7) If a new appointment is made by one management to a higher pay grade post in another management, the conditions of service and service superiority of the new post in the higher pay grade shall apply to the teacher.
Therefore, the service of the previous post will not be accepted for the benefit of senior/ select category.
(a) The government decision. In case of fresh appointment as on 15/09/2011, the previous service will be admissible for retirement.
