(1) Government Decision No.4214/ P.No. 103/14/ P.S.-5, dated 03.09.2014 and dated 19.09.2016. No.4214/ Q.No. 103/14/ P.S.-5, dated 27.11.2017 3) Letter No. 2019/ Padua/ Palghar/ Aastha-B (123)/ 2061 dated 31.7.2020
Preamble: After the bifurcation of Thane district and the formation of Palghar district, 6 posts of Class-I and Class-II were created under the Government Decision dated 3.9.2014 to operationalize various offices for the newly created Palghar district. The Government has also decided to transfer a total of 20 posts of Class-3 and Class-4 from Thane district to Palghar district on 27.11.2017. However, as the Finance Department did not approve the creation of the new post, the offices of Superintendent, Salary and Provident Fund Team and Accountant Salary Verification Team under the School Education Department have not been started in Palghar district. The school education department is yet to finalise the schedule. Since it is necessary to start a Pay and Provident Fund Team Office and Pay Verification Team Office in Palghar district, it has been decided to start these offices from the available sanctioned number of posts. The schemes of the Directorate of Minority and Adult Education have almost come to an end. So there is no need for more posts. Therefore, the government was considering to start the offices of Superintendent, Salary and Provident Fund Team (Secondary and Primary) and Accountant Salary Verification Team for Palghar district by transferring 7 posts in the equivalent pay scale in the Directorate of Minority and Adult Education.
Government Decision: In the newly created Palghar district, the Superintendent of School Education Department, Salary and Provident Fund Team, Primary and Secondary Schools, without separating the two offices, considering the number of schools in the district, a single Superintendent, Salary and Provident Fund Team (Primary and Secondary) and Accountant Salary Verification Team are being created. Superintendent, Salary and Provident Fund Team (Primary and Secondary) and Accountant Salary Verification Team for this office
