Government Resolution No. SSN 2019/ Q.No. 111/19/ TNT-2
Madam Cama Marg Hutatma Rajguru Chowk

The Proposal:
In case of reduction in the number of students in the private aided primary/ secondary and higher secondary partially aided schools in the state, the services of individual recognised teachers are terminated. The teachers whose services are terminated are not being adjusted as per the existing rules. Therefore, the demand for the adjustment of individual accredited partially aided teachers in the state was repeatedly demanded by the people's representatives and teachers' organizations. Therefore, to give an opportunity to the individual recognized partially aided teachers of the state to serve again, the government was considering making a provision for adjustment in such vacancies if there were vacancies in the partially aided posts at the same stage.
Government's decision:
The Government is approving the adjustment of the individual recognized partially aided teachers whose services are going to be terminated due to reduction in the number of posts in the year 2022-23 subject to the following terms and conditions.
At the level of Commissioner (Education), first the partially aided post lying vacant in the state should be reviewed.
2. If it is found that partially funded posts are lying vacant in the State, a list of such posts should be prepared. Adjustment of teachers whose services are terminated due to reduction in posts in these vacancies should be done as follows. :
A. The Commissioner (Education) shall prepare the seniority list of the individual recognized partially aided teachers whose service will be terminated due to reduction in the number of posts in the year 2022-23.

b. thereafter make adjustments in the partially aided posts lying vacant as per the seniority of the service. While making the adjustment, the adjustment should be made by following the general rules of reservation, subject, etc. according to the point list given.
(e) Adjustment of partly subsidized staff in individual recognition will be permissible only if the post is available at the same stage of grant. However, in case of non-availability of posts at the grant stage, these employees cannot be adjusted under any circumstances.
e. Non-Personally Recognized: The grantee employees should be given preference to first make adjustments if a similar grant-based vacancy is available within the organization. If the post is not available, adjustment should be made in the partially aided post at the same stage of grant of other institution. Thus, if the post is not available at the same stage, no adjustment can be made and in no case can the grant be adjusted by changing the stage.
(3) No arrears of salary and allowances shall be admissible to the teachers adjusted under this Government Decision during the period from the date of termination of service till the period of adjustment i.e. during the period of non-service.
This Government decision will be applicable only to the non-subsidized employees who have been granted individual recognition in addition to the academic year 2022-23.
