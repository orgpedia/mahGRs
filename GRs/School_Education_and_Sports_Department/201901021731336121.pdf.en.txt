The Proposal:
The government has decided to fill the vacant posts of teachers in primary, upper primary, secondary and higher secondary schools/ junior colleges, including local self-government institutions, which have been declared as private aided/ partially-aided, grant-in-aid, through a computer system called' Pavitra' based on the marks in the aptitude and intelligence test. It was passed on 23.06.2017. The recruitment process has also been detailed. This has been prescribed vide Government Resolution dated 20.06.2018.
Educational and Psychological Qualification for Primary Teachers (Class 1 to 8) in the State. This has been decided by the Government Decision dated 13.02.2013. While it is mandatory to pass the Teacher Eligibility Test for the post of Primary Teacher (Classes 1 to 8), there is no mention of the subject with which the teachers to be appointed for Classes 6 to 8 should pass the Paper-2 group examination. Therefore, although subject-wise teachers are required to be made available for classes 6 to 8, since no such condition has been prescribed for passing the Teacher Eligibility Test, candidates are required to have passed the said examination by taking subjects of another discipline instead of their degree subject. Accordingly, the government was considering whether the appointment of teachers for classes 6 to 8 should be made according to the subject of the teacher eligibility test or according to the subject of graduation.
Government's decision:
The following terms and conditions will be applicable for the recruitment of teachers through the computer system" Pavitra" in all local self-government institutions and private management schools in the state:
1) For the group of 6th to 8th class, even if the candidate has passed the Teacher Eligibility Test with any subject (Mathematics and Science or Sociology), the appointment of the eligible candidate will be based only on the subject of his degree for the upcoming teacher recruitment at present.
2) The government issued a certificate for the recruitment of this teacher. The provisions of 03.12.2014 shall continue to apply.
