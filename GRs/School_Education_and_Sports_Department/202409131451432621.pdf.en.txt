This has been highlighted by reports from some other organizations, such as the national editorial TAT (NAS) Wab, published over the years. Using virtually manageable materials and teaching aids helps to make abstract concepts more concrete. The use of pedagogical techniques in teaching and learning methods is necessary to reduce the fear of mathematics and increase the level of comprehension of students.
