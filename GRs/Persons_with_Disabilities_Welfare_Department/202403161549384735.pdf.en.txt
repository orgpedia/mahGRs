Read: 1. A chronology of the meetings held under the chairmanship of the Chief Minister on 09.11.2022.
Introduction: As per the 2011 census, the number of persons with disabilities in the state (7 categories) is 29.63 lakh, constituting 2.6% of the total population. As per the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, 21 categories of persons with disabilities have been defined. Accordingly, a significant increase in the number of persons with disabilities is expected in the state.
Section 17 (9) of Section 3 of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 specifies the need for inspection of schoolchildren every 75 years for providing comprehensive education. It has also suggested that all differently abled students in the state be surveyed within 2 years of the enactment of the law.
Similarly, Section 5 Section 2 (5) requires the State Government and local bodies to formulate activities / plans for health facilities for persons with disabilities as well as disability prevention measures. Accordingly, provision has been made for inspection, screening of persons with disabilities and conducting research to find out the cause of disability.
There is no accurate record of the total population of persons with disabilities or their socio-economic status available with the central government or the state government. Based on the detailed information obtained from the survey of persons with disabilities, the government is determined to empower persons with disabilities and bring them into the mainstream of society by planning various activities and schemes for the holistic development of persons with disabilities (education, training, rehabilitation, financial assistance, social security, positive action plans). This requires the availability of accurate data on disability by district / taluka and category of persons with disabilities, as well as the different types of disability. So that it will be easier to provide government schemes and other facilities to the differently abled persons according to their type of disability. Earlier, the decision to conduct a taluk level survey of physically challenged persons in the state was taken as per the Government decision dated 08.02.1994 of the Public Health Department.
Almost 30 years have passed since this survey. It was under consideration of the Government to launch a scheme of door-to-door survey of persons with disabilities in the State to collect information for planning and effective implementation of schemes, programmes, projects for persons with disabilities, identify the problems / needs of persons with disabilities for research on persons with disabilities and to collect information for holistic rehabilitation of persons with disabilities to bring them into the mainstream of the society.
