201/ A.C. 2, dated 20th February, 2019, 4) Government Resolution, Finance Division, No.: S.A. U- 10.10/ Q. No. 96/ 10/ C.E. Dated the 13th of March, 2023.
The Proposal:
The Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995 defines 7 categories of persons with disabilities. As per the 2011 census, the total number of persons with disabilities in the state is 29,63,392, with 16,92,285 males and 12,71,107 females. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 has been enacted and a total of 21 categories of persons with disabilities have been defined. Considering this, the number of divyangs in the present situation is going to be much higher. Instructions have been issued under the Government Decision dated 20th February, 2019 regarding the implementation of the State Disability Policy 2018 for Persons with Disabilities. The Disability Policy covers prevention of disability through health and other mechanisms, early diagnosis of disability, education, training, employment, disability certification and basic information required for planning and administering health insurance schemes.
There are different categories of disabled people. Many of them are not able to go to the divisional level and register their complaints. Therefore, it will be important for the disabled if the government takes measures to address their problems. Therefore, if the government itself goes to the doorsteps of such Divyang brothers, then the Divyangs can be served in the true sense. At the district level, all the officials of the government departments and all the government agencies will be present at one place to know the grievances of the disabled people and the work can be solved at the same place. However, the matter of implementing the campaign" Ministry of Disabled Welfare at the doorstep of Divyang" through the government was under consideration. The government has taken the following decisions:

Government's decision:
The Universal Identity Card (UDID) is a mandatory document for the disabled to take advantage of various government schemes. However, according to the 2011 census, the number of disabled people in the state is 29,63,392, while the number of UDID card holders in the state today is only 9,01,011.
In the absence of this universal identity card (UDID card), the disabled will have to be deprived of the benefits of many schemes. Various committees are working under the chairmanship of the District Collector on various schemes for the disabled. Although the government has directed the districts to speed up this program, it still needs to be accelerated.
Disabled people face many difficulties in daily life. Also, to get the necessary certificates to take advantage of government schemes, a lot of trouble is faced. The government should conduct camps in every district to get all the necessary certificates for the disabled, such as UDID certificate of disability, documents related to agricultural land, caste certificate and other necessary certificates.
One day camp should be organized at one place in every district in consultation with the head guides. In this work, all the major systems, officials of the district and various non-governmental organizations working for the disabled should also be invited.
Various problems related to the government and available schemes for the disabled should be dealt with in this camp.
2. All the district heads of the department are required to be present on the day of the drive.
3. All certificates required by the disabled persons should be provided to them at the camp itself.
For this, along with the existing system, necessary temporary systems should also be set up in coordination with the health department.
4. Arrangements should be made to transport the disabled on the day of the drive.
The campaign should be widely publicized.
In this program, the land of the disabled, caste certificates, registration certificates of various schemes and similar government works should be completed.
3. State Level Committee is being constituted as follows for policy and implementation in respect of various aspects to be taken up in the Mission.
