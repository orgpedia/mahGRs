3) Department of Minority Development, S.No.POBH- 2018/ S.No.52/ K-9, Dy. 01/09/2018 Preamble: As per the instructions given under the 15 Point Programme of the Central Government, in order to provide equal opportunity to the candidates belonging to the minority community in the competitive examination as well as taking into account the very small proportion of minorities in the government service, the Police Constables Recruitment Pre-Training Scheme for the candidates belonging to the minority community has been notified. It came into effect on 27 July 2009.
The Scheme has been partially revised vide Government Resolution dated 29.08.2009.
The scheme was being implemented by the Collectorate under the control of the Maharashtra State Minorities Commission. The government has taken the decision. As per 01/09/2018, it has been decided to implement the scheme from the Collector's office under the control of Minority Development Department instead of Maharashtra State Minorities Commission. The government has taken the decision. In 27/07/2009, provision has been made to train maximum 100 candidates. However, it is not clear how many candidates will be trained. Therefore, it was under the consideration of the government to train at least how many candidates of the minority group under this scheme.
Government Decision: The Police Constable Recruitment Pre-Examination Training Scheme is being implemented for candidates belonging to the minority community. The government has taken the decision. As mentioned on 27th July, 2009, while selecting candidates for training, maximum 100 minority candidates in each district are selected through District Level Selection Committee in proportion to the population of the minority group having educational qualification and physical qualification as determined by the Home Department and they are given training by the private training institute selected at the government level. The government is now giving approval to train a minimum of 30 and a maximum of 100 minority group candidates per district for this training.
At least 30 candidates are eligible for this training program in the respective district by the private training institute selected at the government level, but it is mandatory for them to undergo training in the police constable recruitment pre-examination. The District Collector of the concerned district gave the decision while selecting the trainee. It should be ensured that the selection will be made in proportion to the number of people belonging to minority groups as per the provision mentioned in 27/07/2009.
