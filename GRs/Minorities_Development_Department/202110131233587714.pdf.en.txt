Read: Minority Development Department, Government Resolution No.
Avivi 2009/ Q. No.15/ Q. 8, dated 02.03.2010.
Introduction- The Government Hostel Scheme is implemented for the students (boys/ girls) pursuing higher education from the minority community (Muslim, Jain, Buddhist, Christian, Sikh, Jew and Parsi) in all the districts of the state. The objective of the scheme is to bring minority students into the mainstream and facilitate them to pursue higher education.
At present, the government has adopted the policy of depositing funds directly into the bank accounts of the beneficiaries in cash instead of subsidy under various welfare schemes.
3. The economic condition of the students aspiring to join the hostels of minority students pursuing higher education in the State is very poor. They are unable to afford food. Often, the cost of their meals is more than the cost of their commute from home to school.
Hence, students are not interested in the course. As a result, 70% of the seats reserved for minority students in these hostels are not being fully filled by students belonging to minority communities. Therefore, it has been found that the government's objective of bringing minority students into the mainstream is not fully successful.
Considering the above, it was under consideration of the Government to deposit the amount for the food of the students (boys/ girls) belonging to the minority community admitted in the hostels started by the Minority Development Department directly into their Aadhaar linked bank accounts.
Accordingly, the said Government Decision is being issued as per the approval given by the Cabinet in its meeting dated 04.07.2021.
