Introduction: Minority communities are lagging behind other sections of society in terms of availability of employment. Justice Rajinder Sachar Committee in its report submitted to the Central Government has equally drawn attention to the abysmally low employment participation of minorities in the services in Government/ Paramilitary services and other public undertakings and has advocated the need for conscious efforts by the Government to increase the employment representation of minorities.
State/ Central Services: Special scheme for imparting training to the candidates belonging to minority communities (Muslim, Christian, Sikh, Buddhist, Parsi, Jain and Jewish) for admission to Central Services and Paramilitary Services as well as in Banking Services and other Public/ Private Sector Undertakings through Government and Trusted Non-Government Private Organizations. The guidelines have been prescribed under the Prime Minister's new 15-point programme.
Since 2009-10, the State Administrative Service Training Institute has been imparting training to 10 meritorious minority candidates every year at its training centres in Mumbai, Kolhapur, Nagpur and Aurangabad. Apart from this, Dr. Ambedkar Competitive Examination Guidance Center at Yashwantrao Chavan Vikas Pradarshini, Pune provides training to 10 minority candidates every year for the preparation of competitive examinations conducted by the Union Public Service Commission.
Thus, at present, the State Administrative Service Training Institute, which provides training, and in addition, the training center of Yashwantrao Chavan Vikas Prabodhini, Pune, have limited accessibility, so more and more minority candidates will be admitted to competitive examinations and professional courses through reputable non-government private training institutions in the state.
