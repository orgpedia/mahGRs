Following the prescribed procedure in this regard, the eligible institutions are referred to as Reference No. The 3. The election was held on March 8, 2019. However, due to the Model Code of Conduct issued by the Election Commission subsequently for the Lok Sabha Elections, 2019 and due to the long gestation period for the election process, due to the short period remaining for the financial year 2018-19, adequate time could not be obtained for the training of the above courses. Therefore, in order to start the implementation of the scheme at the earliest, the State Government was considering to select the training institutes for the year 2019-20 instead of conducting a fresh selection process for the year 2018-19.
The government has decided to provide free training under the scheme in Nashik, Pune, Nagpur, Amravati, Mumbai and Thane. The following institutions, which were selected for the year 2018-19 by superseding the decision of the Government dated 8th March, 2019, are being re-selected for the year 2019-20.
