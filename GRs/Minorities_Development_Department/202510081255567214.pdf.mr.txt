Introduction : -
The population of Parsis (Zoroastrians), a notified minority community under the National Commission of Minorities Act, 1992, has declined from 1,14,000 in 1941 to 57,264
in 2011 as per census data. Challenges such as infertility, late marriages, and an aging population have contributed to low birth rates. A significant proportion of the community consists of elderly members, often dependent on younger couples for support. This additional responsibility discourages childbearing among younger families, contributing to low birth rates.
To arrest the decline in population and address the specific needs of both, young families and the elderly in the community, the Government of India, through the Ministry of Minority Affairs, launched the Jiyo Parsi Scheme in September 2013, revised in September 2017. The scheme provides medical assistance, community health support for children and elderly, and awareness among generation. This 15 100% central Government sponsor scheme.
As per revised guidelines of scheme, States/UTs are directed to constitute District Level Committees and a State Level Monitoring Committee for verification of beneficiaries and monitoring of scheme implementation.
