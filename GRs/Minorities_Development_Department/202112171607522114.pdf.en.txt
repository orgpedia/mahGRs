Introduction: The Government has been taking measures from time to time to bring about positive changes in the economic, social and educational upliftment of the people belonging to minority communities. It is equally necessary to create an atmosphere of trust among the youth and girls of the minority community to create awareness among them by removing the obstacles in bringing them into the mainstream of progress. Along with reaching them with the facilities and benefits provided by various departments of the government, it is necessary to pay attention to their personal progress equally seriously. For this, the Minority Development Department gave guidelines on what action should be taken by the different departments of the state. The decision was made on July 4, 2016. In which it has been emphasized that the nature of police training to minority youth should be changed to make them residential.
2. m. Under the Prime Minister's 15-point programme, various programmes are implemented for the welfare of minorities. Some of the major areas of focus include increasing access to education, providing equitable share in economic programmes and service schemes, providing opportunities for employment and self-employment, and recruitment to state and central services. These matters. The Prime Minister's 15-point programme. 10 is clearly stated.
3. Measures to provide special education to the candidates of minority communities in government institutions as well as private educational institutions with credibility.

He said that their representation in education, health, police and banks should be increased. This eliminates discrimination and creates trust among them by creating employment.
The study group headed by Dr. Mehmoodur Rehman suggested measures mainly in the context of educational, social and economic backwardness of the Muslim community in the state. The study group, in its report, has highlighted the need to create awareness in the Muslim-majority areas of the country about the recruitment of police personnel, and recommended that a disciplined programme be implemented for the recruitment of Class 12 pass-outs in the police force. The police department should take the initiative in this regard.
6. In order to provide equal opportunity to the candidates belonging to minority communities in the competitive examination and considering the very small proportion of minorities in the government service, it is necessary to give opportunity to maximum number of candidates in the police service in proportion to their population. For this, the government has decided to start a scheme of training classes for the candidates belonging to the minority community before the recruitment of resident police constables. Therefore, in the present situation, Government Decision No.Aviv2009/ P.C. 188/09/ K-1D. Orders regarding the Police Constable Recruitment Pre-Examination Training Course Scheme, which is in operation as on 27.7.2009, are being superseded.
