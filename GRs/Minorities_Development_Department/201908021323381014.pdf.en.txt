The Proposal:
Through the Central Government, the funds of the Centrally Sponsored Schemes are credited to the Consolidated Fund of the State. The funds are released by the respective implementing departments of the State Governments after budgeting with the State share, through the BEAMS system to the controlling authorities of the respective implementing departments through the Finance Department. The concerned Controlling Authorities disburse the scheme funds through BEAMS to the Drawing and Disbursing Authorities as per the scheme objectives. The Drawing and Disbursing Officer discharges the funds to the concerned supplier/ beneficiary through cheque or RTGS/ NEFT as per the scheme objective by crediting the amount in his bank account after deducting the payment from the treasury of the concerned fund. After the process of registering the bank account of the concerned Drawing and Disbursing Officer in the PFMS system, it is possible to disburse the amount to the concerned beneficiary/ beneficiary in a very simple and easy manner. Its account is also immediately visible to all the concerned authorities who have administrative control over these schemes on the system. Therefore, it is mandatory to implement the PFMS system in the state. As per the policy of this Government, it has been decided to adopt Public Financial Management System (PFMS) for Centrally Sponsored Schemes of Minority Development Department and State Sponsored Schemes. It was under the consideration of the government to declare a nodal officer, State Scheme Manager (SSM) and First Level Agency for the implementation of this system.
