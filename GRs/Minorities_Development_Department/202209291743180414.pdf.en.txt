Till now, project-wise funds were being distributed under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Vikas Karyakram. But many times, the first installment of the central share released for the project remains unutilized due to non-availability of land or other reasons. Keeping this in view, the guidelines have been issued that the project-wise funds will no longer be released by the Central Government and if the funds already released by the Central Government for a project are available with the State Government, then the available funds can be used for the completion of the other project as per the need and the project will be completed within the stipulated time. Therefore, the constructions in the above table are referred to as Pillar No. The funds are being released as mentioned in clause (9) and the same will be released to other projects as per requirement, taking into account the requirement of the same construction or other project/ progress report (QPR)/ Utilization Certificates (UC) submitted.
