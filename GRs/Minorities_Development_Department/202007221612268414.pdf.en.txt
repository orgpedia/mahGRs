A budget of Rs one crore has been allocated for this. Out of this, the Finance Department has approved a total expenditure of Rs 2 crore within the limit of 20 per cent. Under this scheme, funds were supposed to be distributed to the receiving and eligible madrasas in the financial year 2019-20, but in the situation of the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus, due to the lockdown situation, in this regard, the Finance Department has allowed spending of funds only on the honorarium of the teachers of the madrasas. Therefore, the matter of disbursing the salary of teachers to the madrassas whose proposals were not disbursed in 2019-20 was under the consideration of the government.
Dr. Zakir Hussain Madrassa Modernization Scheme for modernization of registered Madrassas in the State has been operationalized vide Government Resolution dated 11.10.2013. Accordingly, a committee has been formed under the chairmanship of the respective district collectors to recommend eligible madrassas to the government for grant under the scheme. The district-wise details of the number of Madrassas which have been declared eligible for grant-in-aid by the District Collectors in their jurisdiction for the year 2019-20 and the grant-in-aid required for the remuneration of their teachers but sanctioned with the approval of the Government are as under:
