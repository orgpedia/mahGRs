Introduction- Many castes and tribes of nomadic tribes in the state of Maharashtra still live a migratory life by wandering. There are many groups of tandas/ hamlets like Laman, Banjara, Dhangar, Pardhi etc. in which people of these castes/ tribes have been living for many years, but such tandas or hamlets do not have basic facilities and are inclined towards modernity, but the majority of the society is living in poverty. For this, it is necessary to provide facilities to this community in tandas, wadis or hamlets so that they can lead a stable life. The Dalit Vasti Sudhar Yojana is being implemented in the Scheduled Caste colonies since 1972 and on the same lines, the Vasantrao Naik Tanda/ Vasti Sudhar Yojana has been started by the Government from the financial year 2003-04 for the improvement of the nomadic community in the State. Read here to know about this scheme. Detailed instructions have been issued under the Government Decision No. 2.
