Under this scheme, water supply works, sewerage, electricity, construction of gutters, internal roads, approach roads, rain water harvesting, etc. should be taken up on priority and after the construction of basic amenities in all the villages, a community temple should be constructed and in view of communal harmony, there should be a single community temple for the entire village and it should be in a strategic place where all the scheduled castes and neo-Buddhist communities can benefit.
For this scheme, the limit of subsidy has been fixed under the Government decision of Reference No. 03 above. It's been a long time. In this regard, the basic facilities are not available in these habitations, considering the subsidy, the maximum limit and duration of the subsidy in proportion to the population. As a result, the original plan was not implemented. Considering the increase in the inflation index, the increased prices of materials and labor, the government was considering increasing the amount of subsidy under the scheme and including the work of" Construction of Constituent Assembly" under the scheme for the development of the habitations of Scheduled Castes and New Buddhists.
