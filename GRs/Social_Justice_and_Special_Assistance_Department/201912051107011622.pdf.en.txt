Government circular
Government decision By 25/06/2019, the functions of Sarathi Sanstha have been transferred to this Department. The department has also decided to set up two more institutes named Mahajyoti and AMRUT.
The company currently has no revenue. A salary/ non-salary provision has also been made in the Budget for 2019-20 for Sarathi. However, provision will be made for salary/ non-salary in future for Mahajyoti/ AMRUT institutions after accounting.
It has been brought to the notice of the Government that for the salary/ non-salary provision made by the Government to these institutions, guidelines have been issued by the Government as well as for what purpose and in what manner this fund should be used. Article 24 of the Memorandum of Association states:
The government has the power to issue orders. So, what are the plans to be initiated for the purpose of the organization before spending the funds. Also, the government has the right to determine the funds, terms and conditions according to the scheme.
If the institutions are implementing some schemes from their own funds, then there will be no need for government approval for it. But if the institutions are implementing the scheme with the help of government subsidy, then it is necessary to get the approval of the government. Also, Sarathi and other institutions have no right to take any decision going against any policy, financial rules and prevailing procedure of the government. It should be ensured that the government's policy, financial rules and directives given by the government from time to time are not violated under any circumstances.
Please note that the Managing Directors of the respective organisations will be held personally liable in case of any breach of the aforesaid provisions.
