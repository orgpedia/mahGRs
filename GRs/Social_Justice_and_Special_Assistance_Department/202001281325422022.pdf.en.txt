Implemented since 1/11/2005 and prescribed procedures.
The above Government decision also states that the Controlling Officer of the Director, Vijabhaj, Emav and Vimapra Kalyan, Pune and the Regional Deputy Commissioner, Social Welfare will act as the Deputy State Records Maintenance Agency for the ashramshalas of the Vijabhaj community and the ashramshalas for the children of sugarcane workers.
In the Budget Session of March, 2018, a starred question was raised in the Legislative Council regarding the payment of Government dues under the New Pension Scheme to the teaching and non-teaching staff working in Vijabhaj Ashramshala. As per the report received from the Director, Vijabhaj, Imav and Vimaprakalyan, Pune, it appears that some ashram employees in the state are deducting their contribution from the salary, however, the equivalent contribution of the government is not being collected.
