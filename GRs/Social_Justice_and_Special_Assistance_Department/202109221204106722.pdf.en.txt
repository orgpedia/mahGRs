Date: The 21st of September 2021
Introduction: It is essential to address various social, economic, health, housing and security issues of senior citizens. Modern life is very stressful for the elderly. They are forced to deal with the economic situation to meet health and other needs. Due to the absence of regular health check-ups, various diseases of the elderly are detected at the very last stage.
Considering the fact that treatment is delayed and unfortunately the patient is at risk of dying, it is proposed to launch the Sharad Shatam Swasthya Kavach insurance scheme for senior citizens in the state. Under this scheme, the government was considering the formation of a committee to recommend various tests/ diagnostics to be proposed for senior citizens, software system, registration of senior citizens, as well as convergence of this scheme with various schemes of the health department.
Government's decision:
In order to implement the Sharad Shatam Arogya Kavach insurance scheme for senior citizens above 65 years of age, the following committees are being constituted to make recommendations regarding registration under the scheme, various tests/ investigations, software systems, functioning of the scheme and convergence with various schemes of the Health Department.
