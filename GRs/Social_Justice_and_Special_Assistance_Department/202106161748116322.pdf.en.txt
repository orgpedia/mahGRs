" Sant Bhagwan Baba Government Hostel Scheme" for the children of migrant sugarcane workers.
The Government of Maharashtra
Department of Social Justice and Special Assistance
Government Resolution No. BCH-2020/ PR No. 286/ Education-2,
The first floor, Ministry Extension Building,
Mumbai- 400 032.
The date: June 15, 2021.
Introduction: The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, mandates free and compulsory education for children between the age of six and fourteen years. To implement this Act, the government is implementing various schemes effectively so that the students belonging to the marginalized sections of the society do not remain deprived of education. Their children accompany the sugarcane workers who migrate for sugarcane harvesting from October to April every year during the sugarcane harvesting season. More than seven lakh sugarcane workers from Maharashtra, mainly from Beed, Ahmednagar, Jalna, Nanded, Parbhani, Osmanabad, Nashik and Jalgaon districts, migrate to the sugar mills in the state as well as to the sugar mills in Karnataka, Telangana and Gujarat bordering the state from October to April every year. At the time of migration of sugarcane workers, their education remains incomplete as their children also migrate with them. As a result, the dropout rate among children in these schools is high. Also, they are pushed into child labour due to lack of education. It was necessary to start a new scheme to increase the faith of the children of sugarcane workers in education and to facilitate their further education. Since Sant Bhagwan Baba had made a great contribution in bringing the deprived section into the stream of education, the matter of starting the" Sant Bhagwan Baba Government Hostel Scheme" for the children of migrant sugarcane workers was under the consideration of the government.
Government Decision: To start Sant Bhagwan Baba Government Hostel Scheme for the children and daughters of migrant sugarcane workers in the 41 talukas mentioned in Annexure' A' where the number of sugarcane workers is more in the state and accordingly to start a total of 82 (100 capacity each) government hostels, 41 for boys and 41 for girls. The Cabinet has approved the same in its meeting held on 02.06.2021. In the first phase, 10 boys and 10 girls will be selected.
