Introduction: Marathwada in Maharashtra is a region with a diverse historical, social, and cultural heritage. The social, geographical, and regional situation in Marathwada is different from the rest of Maharashtra.
Located in the central part of Maharashtra, this Bhogolik region is famous throughout the country as the land of saints.
Marathwada is ruled by the historically famous Satavahana king. Their capital was Paithan (Pratishthan). Marathwada and the region have since been ruled by powerful dynasties such as the Vakataka, Chalukya, and Yadava periods. The historic fort of Devagiri still stands with the same grandeur as a symbol of the splendor and power of these kings. Marathwada has a very ancient and historically rich heritage. It was incorporated into India on 17 September 1948. During this period, the sanctuary produced rich pilgrimage sites such as Aundha Nagnath, Ghrishneshwar, Parli-Vaijnath, Mahurgarh, Tuljapur, Paithan, Apegaon, Narsi-Namdev, and Ter. The caves at Ajanta and Ellora are world-renowned and rich in diverse art forms.

From the historical land of Marathwada, great saints such as Sant Shrestha Namdeo, Nritya, Dnyaneshwar, Sopan, Muktabai, Gora Kumbhar, Janabai, Jagamitra Naga, Eknath, Sena Nawaavi, and Janardhan Swami have given the message of tolerance, propagation of Bhagavata Dharma, ghostly love, equality in this land. Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji's samadhi is also in Nanded and is visited by a large number of Sikhs. It is for this reason that the veena of equality of all religions continues in Marathwada even today. The rivers Godavari, Purna and Manjra flow mainly through Marathwada. The river has enriched life in these areas to some extent. The Godavari is the lifeline of Maharashtra and a large urban agglomeration is located on the banks of the river.
4. This is Marathwada in Maharashtra. On 1 November 1956, it joined the bilingual Bombay Presidency and became a part of the Bombay Presidency. Marathwada has been an integral part of Maharashtra since 1 May 1960. The Nizam government controlled the administrative structure of the Marathwada division under the then Nizam government. In such a situation, there is a considerable difference between the administrative practices of the then British Raj and the Nizam's rule. In this prosperous Marathwada region, there have been large-scale reservation-related protests in recent times. For this purpose, it has been decided to find out the records of Kunbi, Kunbi-Maratha and Maratha-Kunbi of this area and to provide justice to the people of this area. on September 7, 2023. The committee was appointed under the chairmanship of Justice Sandeep Shinde (Retd). The committee was provided with the necessary mechanism to search for records in all eight districts of Marathwada. The committee has examined all kinds of documents available from various government offices in Marathwada and found a large number of records of the hitherto undiscovered Kunbi caste. The meetings were conducted through district-wise AV in Marathwada by the said committee.
Since Hyderabad was the capital of the Nizam's government at the time and the Gazetteer of Hyderabad as required, the committee has visited the Archives Department and the Revenue Department in Hyderabad twice and obtained more than 7,000 documents for study. It has also visited the census office and their library in Delhi to obtain the country's census and corresponding documents from the then Nizam government. Meanwhile, it has tried to obtain documents from the then Nizam government by visiting the National Archives in Delhi. Besides, action has been taken to make available personal documents to those in Marathwada which would be useful for obtaining caste certificates. Mr. Justice Sandeep Shinde (Retd) Committee has taken action in the last two years through a large-scale field system to find out the Kunbi records in Marathwada and Maharashtra continuously. The Government has accepted all the recommendations in the reports submitted so far by the Hon'ble Justice Sandeep Shinde (Retd) Committee along with various recommendations and action has been taken by various departments on this basis. Further appropriate action will be taken on the basis of the report submitted by the said committee.
However, Marathwada has a much larger Kunbi-Maratha community and there has been a frequent demand that the Hyderabad Gazette should be implemented for obtaining caste certificates. Mr. Justice Sandeep Shinde (Retd) Committee has been directed to study and submit a report on the implementation of the Hyderabad, Satara and Bombay Gazette. The deadline has been extended until the end of December 31, 2025. Accordingly, five districts (Aurangabad, Parbhani, Nanded, Beed, and Osmanabad) under the then Nizam government have been studied by visiting Hyderabad and Delhi. Under the then Nizam government, the Kunbi caste was known as Kapu, their main occupation being agriculture. These documents / gazetteers (1921 and 1931) contain records such as Kunbi / Kapu. Earlier, notification has been issued for inclusion of various records in sub-section 19 of section 18 of the Maharashtra Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Denotified Castes, Nomadic Tribes, Other Backward Classes and Special Backward Classes (Regulation of Certification of Caste) Act, 2000 and in clause (f) of sub-rule (2) of rule 4 of the Rules, 2012, after (f).

Based on that inquiry, the competent authority will decide on giving the applicant a caste certificate.
