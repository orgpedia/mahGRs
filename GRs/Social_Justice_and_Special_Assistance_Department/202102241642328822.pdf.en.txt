The Proposal:
As per the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, the Government of India has decided to provide free and compulsory education to primary school teachers. Educational, professional and teacher qualification examinations for classes 1 to 8 have been made mandatory. As per the decision of the Government, it has been decided under section 02 of the Act that the teachers appointed in the upper primary ashramshalas attached to the primary ashramshalas and secondary ashramshalas of the Vijabhaj category from 1st to 8th standard will have to undergo the Academic and Professional and Teacher Eligibility Test. But the government has taken a decision. """"""" As the institutions running ashramshalas and ashramshalas of the meritorious category are under the misconception that it is applicable only to teachers appointed after 23/08/2018 and that it is mandatory for the teachers appointed before that to pass the"""""""" academic, professional and teacher eligibility test,""""""""""" The Government is receiving proposals from the Regional Office for recognition of teachers who have not passed the" Academic and Vocational and Teacher Eligibility Test" before 23/08/2018. Hence, the government should come out with a clarification on the issue.
