Reference:- Department of General Administration, Government Resolution No. Mavaj-2020/ No. 33/ Office- 34, D. 16.03.2020
Preamble: The United Nations has adopted the following objectives for the empowerment of persons with disabilities: innate self-esteem, personal autonomy, freedom of self-determination and individual liberty, non-discrimination, full and effective participation and inclusion in society, acceptance of the uniqueness of persons with disabilities in order to preserve the diversity and humanity of human beings, equal opportunities, accessibility, gender equality, development and recognition of children with disabilities, and their protection.
To achieve these objectives, the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 has been enacted by the Central Government. Case No. Article 24 (1) directs the State to formulate schemes and programmes for the protection of the rights of persons with disabilities to attain an adequate standard of living in order to enable them to live independently or in a society in their own capacity and development.
Differently abled persons in the State require various assistive devices to make their lives easier and accessible. So that they can overcome their disabilities and live life like common people. To know what assistive devices they need to overcome their disability, it is necessary to get the necessary medical test done and determine the assistive devices based on that, even after that it is not possible to compensate for it due to limited resources. At the same time, philanthropists, social and service organizations in the society want to provide necessary support tools to make the disabled accessible. However, due to the lack of a link between the two, disabled people feel the lack of necessary assistive devices.
The Central Government has enacted the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016.
There are 21 categories of specified disabilities in the Annexure provided under Section 2 (zc) of the Act. Since there were only six types of disabilities at the time of the last census at the national and state level, it is necessary to provide current information about the persons falling under 21 types of disabilities. To create awareness among the persons with disabilities and to provide information and assistance to them from charitable individuals, social and service organizations.
