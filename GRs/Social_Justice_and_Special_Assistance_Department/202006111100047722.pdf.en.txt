Introduction: The state government had given permission to 148 higher secondary ashramshalas by linking them with the secondary ashramshalas run for the children of the weaker sections in the state. According to the said government decision, the educational qualification of the higher secondary teachers to be appointed in the Arts and Science branch of the higher secondary ashramshala has been mentioned. However, the government has made compulsory subjects- Marathi and English- and optional subjects- history, political science, sociology and economics- for teachers to be appointed in the arts branch of higher secondary ashramshalas. However, it has come to the notice of the government that apart from these optional subjects, some higher secondary schools have appointed teachers for geography even though it is not an optional subject. The appointment has been approved by the competent authority. In the case of such employees, now the possibility of many court cases arising if the action of de-recognition is taken is not ruled out.
Geography is among the group of subjects taught in government higher secondary schools. The majority of students choose to study history and geography. Therefore, it was necessary to include the subject of geography in the optional subjects of the Arts stream. But reference No. The subject of geography has not been included in the issuance of the Government Decision No. 1. Therefore, it is necessary to remove the ambiguity regarding the urgency of the students of Vijabhaj Higher Secondary Ashramshala in the state and the educational qualification of the teachers to be appointed in the Arts stream.

Reference No. After the approval to appoint a teacher in the arts branch of the Higher Secondary Ashram School as per the government decision of 1, the students of this Higher Secondary Ashram School are suffering from academic loss as there is no teacher available to teach other subjects or teachers of specific qualifications are not being made available as per the education department. Therefore, in view of all the above, it is necessary to include Geography as one of the optional subjects for the Arts stream in the Higher Secondary School of this Department. Therefore, considering all the aspects, the matter of including geography subject in the optional subjects for the art branch in the higher secondary ashramshala of this department was under the consideration of the government.
Government Decision: In the optional subjects for the Arts stream of the Government aided Higher Secondary School run by the Other Backward Bahujan Welfare Department- Geography. This topic is included.
Reference No. 2. All the proposals of the candidates who have been approved by the concerned Regional Deputy Commissioner, Social Welfare Department in the past, even if the candidates to be appointed in the Arts Branch do not have the necessary educational qualifications as mentioned in the Government Decision of 1, should be submitted to the Government for post-facto approval with the disclosure of the Regional Deputy Commissioner. In such a case, the salary of these employees should not be paid without the approval of the government.
3. Proposals for recognition of Higher Secondary teachers appointed for Geography in Higher Secondary Ashramshalas which have been duly recognized by the Government are pending with the Regional Office. Also, the proposals that qualify as per this Government decision should also be sent to the Government for approval along with suitable recommendations/ points as per the reservation policy. So that the right decision is taken.
