Preamble: - At present, 443 Government Hostels for the education of Backward Classes students and 93 Government Residential Schools for the education of SC / ST and newly educated boys and girls are functioning under the Social Justice and Special Assistance Department. A total of 43800 students are enrolled in these government hostels and a total of 14,600 students are enrolled in government residential schools. Out of these 443 hostels, 288 hostels are in the government building and 155 hostels are functioning in the rented building. While 93 government residential schools are functioning in these government buildings. Government Hostels and Government Residential Schools are doing a commendable job in ensuring the economic, social and educational progress of the students enrolled in Government Residential Schools under Department B. The admitted students are being provided with facilities like free accommodation, food arrangements, health facilities, sports facilities, educational materials, boarding and lodging, living allowance, etc.
Most of the government hostels and government residential schools under the Social Justice and Special Assistance Department are in rural areas. Due to heavy load-bearing by the power distribution company in rural areas of the state, students face difficulties in getting hot water for bathing and studying at night due to lack of electricity. Also, students in government hostels and government residential schools under the department are residents and besides boys, girls are also admitted, so lights are necessary for the safety of students at night. However, considering the fact that the load control by the power distribution company does not provide electricity, the government hostels running in MAHI buildings under the department and MAHA residential schools need to have solar highmast lights and solar water heater for hot water for bathing in order to provide permanent electricity.
