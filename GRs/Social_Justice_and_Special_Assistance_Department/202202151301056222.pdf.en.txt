Government Resolution, Social Justice and Special Assistance Department, No. EDD-2019/ PR No.
120/ D.C. 1, dated 23rd April, 2021.
Government's stand:
The revised pay structure as per the 7th Pay Commission has been implemented under the Government decision dated April 23, 2021, for full-time teaching and non-teaching staff in government approved and subsidized non-government residential/ non-residential special schools/ workshops for the disabled and children's homes for the mentally retarded. All District Social Welfare Officers, Zilla Parishad and Assistant Commissioner, Social Welfare, Mumbai City/ Suburban should fix the salary accordingly and verify it through the office of the Commissioner, Divyang Welfare, Pune.
However, the total number of aided special schools/ workshops for the disabled in the State is 852 and the number of children's homes for the mentally challenged is 14. As a large number of employees are employed in these, time is wasted in verifying the service books by the limited staff in the office of the Commissioner, Divyang Kalyan, Pune. In view of this, the authority to verify the service books of the employees in the said offices is now being handed over to the concerned Regional Deputy Commissioner, Social Welfare.
