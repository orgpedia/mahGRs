Preamble: - Government Decision General Administration Department (IT), dated 12.10.2018 has implemented a single state level system of Direct Benefit Transfer (MDBT) system for distribution of benefits, financial assistance and services provided by various departments of the government to the intended and eligible beneficiaries. The Department of Social Justice and Special Assistance implements pre-matric and post-matric scholarship schemes for students belonging to the Scheduled Castes category. The government decision dated 07.08.2017 of the department makes it mandatory to use the state-level DBT system for all processes from applying for scholarship schemes to crediting the scheme benefit amount into the beneficiary student's Aadhaar-enabled back account. The benefits of post-matric scholarship schemes are given directly to the students through the MahaDBT portal.
Although the post-matric scholarship scheme is being implemented through the MahaDBT system from the year 2018-19 to 2023-24, students are facing many difficulties such as auto-rejection of applications by many students even after filling the application form in the prescribed time frame due to various difficulties encountered while applying on the portal, failure to fill the application form due to non-fulfillment of the result of the student's regular examination or supplementary examination in a year, or difficulty in renewing the application form for the next year even after filling the application. Therefore, eligible students cannot be given the benefit of the scholarship. Considering all these aspects, the Department of Information and Technology has given feedback that when the cases are submitted to the Department of Information and Technology for further action / feedback, such cases should be decided at the department level. In fact, the Government was contemplating to implement the following procedures for disposal of pending applications under the scholarship / free-ship scheme for SC / ST students for the period 2018-19 to 2023-24.
Government Decision - In the year 2018-19 to 2023-24, students who have faced difficulties in registering or getting their registered applications approved on the MahaDBT system are being allowed to submit offline scholarship applications subject to the following terms and conditions.
