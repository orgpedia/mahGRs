The benefits of the works done under the Scheduled Castes Sub-Plan should be for the Scheduled Castes. It will not be appropriate to take the cremation ground from the Bharat Ratna Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Social Development Scheme, if there is a cremation ground only for the Scheduled Castes, it will be appropriate to take it from this scheme. The district collector should examine this matter and check whether the proposed works can be done through convergence.
While carrying out the said activities, the Assistant Commissioner, Social Welfare and the operational machinery of the district will be jointly responsible for the fact that the funds under the Bharat Ratna Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Social Development Scheme are being spent only in the habitations of the Scheduled Castes and the neo-Buddhists.

Similarly, it will be necessary to comply with the government decisions regarding circulation.
Since the District Collector of the concerned district has been declared as the Controlling Officer for the funds sanctioned under the Bharat Ratna Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Social Development Scheme, the concerned Collector should ensure that the above provisions are complied with in connection with the completion of these works through convergence.
