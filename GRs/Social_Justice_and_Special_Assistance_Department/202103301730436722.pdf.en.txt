Government Resolution No: Savio-2021/ No.1/ Ajak
Ministry Extension, Mumbai- 400 032.
The date: March 26, 2021.
Read: Government decision, dated March 9, 2018.
The Proposal:
The scheme for improvement of habitations of SCs and OBCs (earlier Dalit Vasti Sudhar Yojana) is being implemented by the Department since 1974 to provide infrastructure facilities to the habitations/ villages of SCs and OBCs in urban and rural areas of the State. Under this scheme, the development of the habitations/ villages of Scheduled Castes and neo-Buddhist communities in urban and rural areas in the state has not been uniform. The villagers and the residents of the urban areas of the state have to face many problems due to the pending development works in the settlements/ villages of the special category in the urban and rural areas of the state due to lack of funds. In this regard, the people's representatives are repeatedly demanding large amounts of funds for the development of the habitations/ villages of the Scheduled Castes and the neo-Buddhist communities.
Considering this, a new state level scheme, Bharat Ratna Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Samajik Vikas Yojana, has been prepared by this department under the above mentioned Government Decision, dated 9th March, 2018, to approve the works suggested by the people's representatives for the development of habitations/ villages in urban and rural areas of Scheduled Castes and neo-Buddhist communities in the state.
Under this scheme, funds are provided directly from the government level on the lines of the Department of Rural Development, Minorities and Urban Development to the people's representatives of the areas where development works have not been done adequately in the villages/ hamlets due to lack of adequate funds despite receiving funds under the Scheduled Castes and New Buddhists Habitat Improvement Scheme.
Till now, the implementation of the Bharat Ratna Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Social Development Scheme was based on the same parameters for rural and urban areas, e.g. Although the scheme has been largely successful in rural areas due to the nature of the work and the funds allocated to it, the scheme is less popular in urban areas. Also, the implementation of the scheme is not visible in the visual form.

The problems of the Scheduled Castes and the neo-Buddhists in urban areas are also different from those in rural areas. As the funds available are very inadequate as per the decision of the present government, the visible results of the work being done are not visible. Also, it is very important to spread awareness about this scheme through the people's representatives in the city.
Therefore, the government was considering the formation of a study group on how to implement the" Bharat Ratna Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Social Development Scheme" in urban areas.
Government's decision:
A Study Group is being set up to effectively implement the Bharat Ratna Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Social Development Scheme in urban areas as follows:
1. m. Minister of Social Justice and Special Assistance: Chairman
2. m. Minister of Education: Vice President
3. Ma. Minister of Energy, Member
4. Ma. Minister of Housing: Member of Parliament
5. m. Minister of State, Environment, Water Supply and Sanitation: Member
6. Ma. Minister of State for Social Justice: Member
