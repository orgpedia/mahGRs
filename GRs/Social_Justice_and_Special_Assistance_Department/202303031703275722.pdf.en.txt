Introduction: The Central Government has passed the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019.
Section 5- Section 9 and 10 of the said Act provide that no establishment shall discriminate against any third party in any matter relating to employment. Every institution shall comply with the provisions of this Act.
The state government's women policy, 2014, also mentions efforts to rehabilitate transgenders who have been thrown out of the mainstream of society. Accordingly, it is necessary to identify the third gender and develop the third gender.
National Legal Services Authority v. Union of India (Writ Petition No. 400/2012, and 604/2013). The Supreme Court has directed the Centre and state governments to take steps to treat transgenders as socially and educationally backward class citizens and provide all kinds of reservations in terms of admissions in educational institutions and for public appointments.
At present, Sampada Gramin Mahila Sanstha (Sangram) and others are demanding reservation for transgenders in jobs and education. Public Interest Litigation (PIL) at High Court, Mumbai No. 2781/2022 has been filed.
Similarly, during the hearing of an application of a transgender (applicant) in the Maharashtra Administrative Tribunal, Mumbai, it is expected that the state government will come out with a clear policy regarding allowing her to apply for the post of Sub-Inspector of Police as a transgender candidate, as well as taking steps to treat transgenders as socially and educationally backward class citizens and in the matter of admission to educational institutions and reservation for public appointments and provision of posts.
A writ petition has also been filed in the Bombay High Court. 15033/ 2022 (Arya Pujari) and Writ Petition No. 15037/ 2022 (Nikita Mukhayadal)

Similarly, petitions are being filed in various courts regarding the reservation of jobs and education for transgenders under various administrative departments of the state.
In the 2014 NALSA results, Ma. The Supreme Court had noted that the third gender should be considered as an option to protect the rights of the transgender community, apart from men and women.
Therefore, in view of the directions of various courts and provisions of law as aforesaid, it is proposed to make it mandatory for the transgender community in the State to provide the option of" transgender" along with the option of" male" and" female" as a gender option in educational, employment and government schemes under the State Government, wherever the question of gender is asked.
