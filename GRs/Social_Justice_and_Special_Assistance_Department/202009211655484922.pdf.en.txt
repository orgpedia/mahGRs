Under the Centrally Sponsored National Family Benefit Scheme (NFBS), a sum of Rs.20,000/-is given to the family of a deceased male/ female in the age group of 18-59 years (below 60 years), who is registered in the list of Below Poverty Line (BPL) families.
Under the Government Order dated 28.09.2000, the deadline for receipt of applications by the family members of the deceased for availing the benefit of the National Family Benefit Scheme after the death of the male or female member of the family living below the poverty line is 1 year from the date of death. Now, it is being approved to accept the application of the family member of the below poverty line family within 3 years instead of 1 year from the date of death after the death of the male or female member. Applications received after the due date shall not be entertained.
Applicants must be thoroughly vetted. Also, the concerned officers/ employees should ensure that only eligible applicants get financial assistance under this scheme.
This order shall come into force from the date of issue of this order.
