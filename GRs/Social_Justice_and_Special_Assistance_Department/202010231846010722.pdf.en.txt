The decision to abolish the condition that it requires a degree in the course for the course" was taken under the Government Decision dated May 5, 2020.
However, in view of the difference of opinion received from various beneficiary groups and the need to take a decision after extensive consultations with all beneficiary groups, the Government decision dated 5th May, 2020 was kept in abeyance by the Government decision dated 21st May, 2020. Thereafter, in view of the COVID-19 outbreak, it would take time to take a decision after discussing with all sections of the society, the Government was directed to implement the Overseas Scholarship Scheme for the year 2020-21 in the same manner as the Overseas Scholarship Scheme was implemented in the year 2019-20 and to publicize the scheme accordingly. Accordingly, the matter of approving the action taken by the Commissioner, Social Welfare, Pune was under consideration of the Government.
Government's decision:
2. Approval is being given to implement the Overseas Scholarship Scheme for SC and OBC students for the year 2020-21 in the same manner as the Overseas Scholarship Scheme for SC and OBC students was implemented in the year 2019-20.
3. Under the Overseas Scholarship Scheme for Scheduled Caste and neo-Buddhist students, the requirement of graduation in the same course for post-graduation courses is being abolished. Accordingly, if a student of a discipline is admitted by a foreign university to a post-graduate degree course in another discipline as permitted by the government, the student should be considered for the benefit under the said admission scheme.
The Commissioner, Social Welfare, Pune shall take action as per the remaining terms and conditions of the Government Decisions dated 27.06.2017, 01.7.2017 and 30.06.2018 in the context of sanctioning of scholarships under the said scheme.
