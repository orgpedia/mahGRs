5. The name of the department is very broad and broad in pronunciation. Considering the nature of the schemes entrusted to this department and the newly launched schemes of the department as well as the schemes transferred to this department by the Department of Higher and Technical Education, it was thought that the name of this department should be comprehensive and concise. The meeting was chaired by the Minister (Welfare of Other Backward Classes, Socially and Educationally Backward Classes, Vimukt Jati, Nomadic Tribes and Special Backward Classes).
After discussions, it was decided that the name of the department should be changed from" Other Backward Classes, Socially and Educationally Backward Classes, Vimukt Jati, Nomadic Tribes and Special Backward Classes Welfare Department" to" Bahujan Kalyan Vibhag" considering all the categories associated with this department.
6. Considering the nature of work of the subjects assigned to this department and the subjects transferred from the Social Justice and Special Assistance Department, the name given to the department earlier was too large and broad to pronounce, so the government was considering changing the name to Other Backward Classes, Social and Educational Backward Classes, Vimukta Jati, Nomadic Tribes and Special Backward Classes Welfare Department.
