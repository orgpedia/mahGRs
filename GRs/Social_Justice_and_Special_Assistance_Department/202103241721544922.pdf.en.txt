Government's decision
Under the Bahujan Welfare Department, schools are run for the children and daughters of the primary, secondary and higher secondary ashramshalas, vidyaniketans and sugarcane workers for the Vimukta Jati, Nomadic Tribes, Other Backward Classes and Special Backward Classes. The building rent is sanctioned to these ashramshalas as per the government decision mentioned here. However, the. The schools/ ashramshalas in the state were closed due to the lockdown on the background of the outbreak of Corona (COVID-19) since March 19, 2020. Classes 5 to 8 have started from January 27, 2021. In this backdrop, the decision on whether or not to grant building rent to ashramshalas for the year 2020-21 was under consideration of the government.
2. Even if the Ashramshalas are closed due to lockdown, the Ashramshalas will be liable to pay the building rent to the institutions/ private persons from whom the Ashramshalas have taken the building on rent and even if there is a lockdown, the building was required to be kept on rent basis. Therefore, it has become necessary for the government to approve the building rent for the year 2020-21. Therefore, the Government is approving the grant of building rent for the year 2020-21 to the Ashramshalas under the Bahujan Welfare Department as per the prevailing policy subject to the terms and conditions in the existing Government Decisions/ Circulars. However, the approval will not be applicable to those higher secondary ashramshalas out of 148 which have not yet been approved by the Finance Department for non-salary grant.
