Training Institute (Sarathi), Pune. As per the Government decision dated 25.02.2018 and to carry forward the ideology of Krantisurya Mahatma Jyotiba Phule and Krantijyoti Savitribai Phule and to create an educated society in their thought, the Government of Maharashtra has decided to establish Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Research and Training Institute (MAHAJYOTI) for the educational, economic and social development of Other Backward Classes, Vimukt Jati, Nomadic Tribes and Special Backward Classes in Maharashtra. 08.08.2019 (pursuant to Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013). The Maharashtra Academy of Research, Upliftment and Training (AMRUT), Mumbai is a premier institute for the development of students and youth through various activities, programs, etc. The autonomous body has been established under the Government Decision dated 22.08.2019.
Among all these autonomous institutes, TRTI is the oldest institute followed by Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Research and Training Institute, Pune (BARTI). Other institutions have been established in the last four to five years. Therefore, on the basis of the programs of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Research and Training Institute, Pune (BARTI), other institutions also prepare their programs. During the last 5 years, these institutions have been conducting training on scholarships for research and related social components, UPSC, MPSC, IBPS, Police Recruitment, Army Recruitment Training for students, besides skill development training for employment and self-employment. Apart from this, projects like Samtadoot, Taradoot are also implemented to reach the schemes of the department to the people and to publicize them. Through this, the schemes being implemented by the government/ institutions for those social sectors are being taken to the grassroots level.
In the recent past, all these institutions, with the approval of their governing bodies or as per the directions of the government, have been conducting training for students for scholarships, UPSC, MPSC, IBPS, police recruitment, army recruitment. Since these decisions were taken separately by each institution or department, the required uniformity was not maintained. Therefore, there are demands that the scheme should be implemented in the same way for another social unit by pointing to the scheme of one social unit. Accordingly, the students are resorting to agitations, hunger strikes, etc. to make various demands in line with the schemes like fellowship, foreign scholarship, Swayam, Swadhar, etc. As a result, a lot of time of the police and administrative machinery is being spent in dealing with such agitations, hunger strikes, etc.
Accordingly, Tribal Research and Training Institute, Pune, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Research and Training Institute, Pune (BARTI); Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj Research and Training Institute (SARATHI) Pune, Mahatma Page 2 of 6
