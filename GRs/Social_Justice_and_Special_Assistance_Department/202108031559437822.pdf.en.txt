Government Resolution No., Department of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, ITI 2217/ PR No. 99/ Vyashi-3, dated 29th May, 2019
The Proposal:
CST training is being imparted through government and private industrial training institutes in the state. The main objective of the scheme is to provide skilled manpower to the private industrial establishments by empowering the youth for employment and self-employment through job oriented training. At present, there are 417 government industrial training institutes and 466 private industrial training institutes in the state.
2. Under the Government decision dated 14/05/2015 of the Department of Higher and Technical Education, the training fee to be charged for admission to the seats available under the PPP scheme in Private and Government Industrial Training Institutes and Government Industrial Training Institutes has been approved. The training fee received from students is the only source of income for a private industrial training institute and most of the candidates seeking admission to courses under the Craftsman Training Scheme are from economically weaker sections. They do not have the financial situation to pursue engineering, medical, or traditional higher education or tend to earn money by getting employment as soon as they pass the examination in school. Students who have not been admitted to the Government Industrial Training Institute can take admission in the Private Industrial Training Institute if they are financially able. As a result, students are deprived of education due to lack of financial resources. It is, therefore, in order to prevent the economically weaker students in the EWS, EWS and Insured categories from being deprived of professional skills due to lack of financial capability.
Partial reimbursement of vocational training fee to the students belonging to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Nomadic Tribes and Denotified Tribes, Special Backward Classes and Other Backward Classes and Economically Weaker Sections admitted through centralized admission process in the Government Industrial Training Institutes and in the Private Industrial Training Institutes.
