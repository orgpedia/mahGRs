The Proposal:
Foreign Scholarship Scheme has been implemented since 2003 to provide opportunities to the students of Scheduled Castes to study in reputed educational institutions abroad. The Rules of the Scheme have been amended from time to time and the revised Rules of the Scheme have been laid down vide Government Order dated 27.06.2017.
Initially, the scholarship was given to 10 students who have got admission in reputed universities abroad in various subjects under this scheme.
As per the Government decision dated 17th June, 2006, the number of students was increased from 10 to 25. After this, the number of foreign scholarship students has been increased from 25 to 50 as per the government decision dated October 22, 2010. Accordingly, all the government decisions issued under the said scheme since 2003 till date, the revised rules have been implemented under the government decision dated June 27, 2017 by updating and integrating the rules of the scheme after validating the certificates.
3. National Overseas Scholarship Scheme is implemented by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, Government of India in addition to the State Government's Overseas Scholarship Scheme for students belonging to Scheduled Castes. Students belonging to the Scheduled Castes category who wish to pursue higher education abroad apply for both central and state schemes. Some of these students were selected for both programs. However, it has been noticed since last year that some seats in the state government's foreign scholarship scheme remain vacant as most of the students are accepting the central government's scheme, as the students can take advantage of the same scheme as per the rules. The students belonging to the Scheduled Castes category who qualify as per the relevant merit in the selection list under the Foreign Scholarship Scheme of the State Government should not be deprived of the benefit of the Foreign Scholarship Scheme and the Rajarshi Shahu Maharaj of the State Government
