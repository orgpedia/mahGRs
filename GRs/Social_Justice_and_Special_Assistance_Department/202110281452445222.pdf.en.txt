(i) Department of Industries, Energy and Labour, Government Resolution No. 1120/ No. 20/ Work-7A, dated 24/2/2020 2) Department of Social Justice and Special Assistance, Government Resolution No. Meeting 2020/ S. No.94/ Corporations, Dy. 21/9/2021
Introduction: Various welfare schemes need to be implemented for the overall development of sugarcane workers. Accordingly, the total number of sugarcane workers in Maharashtra and their primary data should be recorded. Accordingly, immediate survey/ registration of sugarcane workers is required. In order to ensure that the information is effective, accurate and up-to-date, a web and mobile application should be created to fill this information online, and since there is a short time left for the sugarcane workers to go for sugarcane harvesting, the government was considering to give the work of creating a web application to the Maharashtra Information and Technology Corporation (MahaIT) during this period.
Decision: It has been decided to register all sugarcane workers in the state and give them identity cards to provide benefits of various schemes to sugarcane workers. The government has taken the decision. 21.09.2021. Accordingly, the work of registering sugarcane workers and giving them identity cards through offline mode has started. However, in order for this information to be effective, accurate and up-to-date, it is necessary to create a web and mobile application to fill this information online.
The sugarcane workers usually start leaving from October 15 for harvesting.
Since there is a short time left for the sugarcane workers to leave for sugarcane harvesting, the possibility of delay in the preparation of web and mobile application by implementing the tender process in this short time cannot be ruled out. Therefore, the work of creating web and mobile applications will be done by the Information and Technology Corporation (MahaIT) under the General Administration (Information and Technology) Department.
A proposal in this regard has been sent to the Government. The proposal includes the following costs:
