Section 18.4 of the Code of Ashramas for Primary, Secondary and Higher Secondary Ashramas, Vidyaniketans and Schools for the Children and Girls of Sugarcane Workers belonging to the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Other Backward Classes and Special Backward Classes.
Introduction: Refer No. 1 is mentioned here. The Government Resolution dated 8th October, 1991 contains provisions regarding non-salaried grants admissible to primary, secondary and higher secondary ashramshalas, vidyaniketans and schools for the children and daughters of sugarcane workers belonging to Vimukt castes, nomadic tribes, other backward classes and special backward classes run by non-governmental organizations. There should have been uniformity in the provisions of Rule No. 18.4 of Chapter XVIII of the Ashramshala Code for the primary, secondary and higher secondary ashramshalas, vidyaniketans and schools for the children and daughters of sugarcane workers belonging to the Vimukta Jati, Nomadic Tribes, Other Backward Classes and Special Backward Classes run by voluntary organizations. However, reference No. 1 is mentioned here. There is a difference between the provisions of the Government Order dated October 08, 1991 and the provisions of the Ashramshala Code. In order to remove this discrepancy, the matter of deletion of the words in Rule No. 18.4 of Chapter No. eighteen of the Ashramshala Code was under consideration of the Government. Accordingly, the following words of Rule No. 18.4 are being approved by the Government.
Government's decision:
On the other hand, the following words from Chapter No. 18, Rule No. 18.4 of the Ashram Shaha Code are being omitted for the primary, secondary and higher secondary ashramshalas, vidyaniketans and schools for the sons and daughters of sugarcane workers of the Vimukta Jati, Nomadic Tribes, Other Backward Classes and Special Backward Classes run by the voluntary organizations under the Bahujan Welfare Department.
