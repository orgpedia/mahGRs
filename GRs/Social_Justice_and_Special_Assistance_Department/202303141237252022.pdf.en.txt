Department of Social Justice and Special Assistance. As per the decision taken in the Cabinet meeting held on 08.03.2019, the Government has implemented the Vocational Training Fee Reimbursement Scheme for the students belonging to SC category who have taken admission under PPP Scheme in Government Industrial Training Institutes as well as in Private Industrial Training Institutes through Central Online System. Since the scheme is completely new and the expenditure on reimbursement of training fees on this scheme cannot be spent under the Education Fee, Examination Fee Compensation Scheme of the Department, it was necessary to open a separate head of account for the proposed scheme.
3. As per the proposal submitted by the Commissioner, Social Welfare, Pune, vide Government Resolution dated 1.8.2019, the Commissioner, Social Welfare, Pune was declared as the Controller and Drawing and Disbursing Officer for the implementation of the scheme only. The scheme will be implemented directly by the Social Justice Department or Vocational Training Department at the district and division level, through which department will the applications of the students come to the Commissionerate of Social Welfare? As there was no clarity, the plan could not be implemented. Therefore, it was under the consideration of the Government to fix the modalities for implementation of the scheme and to incorporate certain guidelines/ points in it.
GOVERNMENT DECISIONS: In order to effectively implement the existing Vocational Training Fee Reimbursement Scheme to provide the benefit of training fee reimbursement to the students belonging to Scheduled Castes who are admitted through Central Online System for courses under the Craft Artisan Training Scheme from the Government Industrial Training Institutes as well as from the Private Industrial Training Institutes on the seats available under the PPP Scheme, the Government Decision dated 1st August, 2019, inter alia, lays down the following guidelines/ points for determining the modalities for implementation.
The responsibility of mapping of Industrial Training Institutes/ Courses on MahaDBT system, uploading of approved courses and their sanctioned intake capacity training institution-wise and updating the same from time to time and online verification thereof will be with the concerned Administrative Department (Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Department). Further, in the event of closure of Industrial Training Institutes/ courses/ de-recognition of training institutes registered on the portal in future, the responsibility of making necessary changes/ corrections in the portal lies with the concerned administrative department i. e. Skill Development Department. Therefore, all the concerned District Vocational Education and Training Officers should consider the approved courses and approved intake capacity on the subordinate system of the concerned training institute while approving the applications of the SC category on the MahaDBT portal. If there is any confusion in it, the matter should be brought to the notice of the concerned administrative department through the Commissionerate. Also, if the course approved as per the scheme criteria is not covered under the MahaDBT system, the students belonging to the Scheduled Castes category should not be deprived of the benefit, the responsibility will also be of the Skill Development Department.
