Department of Science and Technology, Government Resolution No: Meeting-2017/ P.S. No. 308/ Teaching-2 dated 8th July, 2019 Preamble:
Under the Social Justice Department, hostels funded by NGOs are run with the objective of enabling backward class students to complete their courses, reducing the dropout rate among backward class students in rural areas, ensuring that backward class parents do not face difficulties in their children's education due to economic deprivation, and educational development of backward class students.
The remuneration of the employees of these subsidized hostels has been increased as per the Government decision dated 8th July, 2019. Since the honorarium of the hostel employees has not been increased since 2019, the concerned hostel employees' organizations and public representatives have been constantly demanding the government to increase the honorarium of the hostel employees.
Accordingly, the matter of increasing the honorarium of the employees of the subsidized hostel hostel under the department was under the consideration of the government.
Government's decision
It will be run by NGOs under the Department of Social Justice and Special Assistance.
