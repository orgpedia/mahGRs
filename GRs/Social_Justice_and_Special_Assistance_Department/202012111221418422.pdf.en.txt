GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: SAMRICH-2020/ PR No.33/ AJAK
Mantralaya, Mumbai- 400 032
The date is December 11, 2020.
Introduction: Since the names of many villages, hamlets and roads in many cities and rural areas of the state are casteist, it is not appropriate for a progressive state like Maharashtra, in order to create social harmony and national integration in the state, the government was considering changing the names of all such villages, hamlets and roads to the names of great men and democratic values instead of such casteist names.
Government's decision:
As the names of many villages, hamlets and roads in many cities and rural areas of the state are casteist, it is not appropriate for a progressive state like Maharashtra to change the names of all such villages, hamlets and roads in order to create social harmony and promote national integration in the state.
2. Considering the importance of the subject, the Urban Development Department for urban areas and the Rural Development Department for rural areas should determine the procedure for changing the caste names and take immediate action to change the caste names.
