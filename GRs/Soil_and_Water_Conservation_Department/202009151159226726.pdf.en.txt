Introduction: Mula is a right canal beneficiation area under the Mula project in Ahmednagar district. The cooperative irrigation schemes are approved to draw water from the canal to the area near the inspection line which is not the benefit area of the canal. The work was completed in 1985. The pipeline under the irrigation project has been damaged. Most of the existing tea (paat) pumps, the main distribution tank, are defunct. A detailed survey and conceptualization of the scheme has been proposed for sustainable water availability. After empowerment, 80% of the benefit area will be restored (2369 hectares). A total of four irrigation schemes have been proposed for empowerment.
The detailed survey and investigation of these four irrigation schemes and preparation of Detailed Project Report are being carried out in the Budget Reference No. As per the letter of Regional Water Conservation Officer, Soil and Water Conservation Department, Nashik, it has been submitted to the government for administrative approval. Accordingly, the proposal for administrative approval of the expenditure required for preparation of Detailed Project Report was under consideration of the Government.
