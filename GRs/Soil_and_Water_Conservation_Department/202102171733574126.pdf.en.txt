Government Resolution Village Development and Water Conservation Department No. 1099/ PR No. 347/ Water-1D. 31/7/2000 4. Dy. dated 04/02/2021. Cabinet meeting 11/02/2021 Preamble To achieve prosperity through irrigation, it is necessary for irrigation projects to function efficiently. Through the water conservation system, water reservoirs have been created in the entire state in decentralized and far-flung areas. Protected irrigation and water supply schemes for agriculture have benefited greatly from these schemes.
In the last 35 to 40 years, a large number of water sources have been created through employment guarantee schemes and other schemes to overcome drought. Out of the completed schemes, about 7916 schemes are required to be restored with special repair and restoration of water storage and irrigation capacity as these water bodies are not being utilized in full efficiency due to lack of regular maintenance and repair. The revival of such schemes will restore the water storage and irrigation capacity to full capacity and provide water for protected irrigation to the farmers. Therefore, the Chief Minister's Water Conservation Program should be implemented to restore the irrigation potential by making special repairs to the water sources under the Department of Soil and Water Conservation. At the Cabinet meeting, No. 3 was submitted for consideration. In the meeting, the following decisions were taken and the plan was approved with some amendments.
(1) The special repair work should not include the work of pipe distribution system (PDN) on the damaged canal.
(2) No work shall be undertaken for special repairs under this scheme which will not result in restoration of any irrigation potential.
Following this, the government took the following decisions:
