circular
Under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), Rs. 1 as per the government's decision. 203/- per day has been fixed and the wage rate sheet has been fixed accordingly. The list It has been implemented since June 20, 2019. However, whenever the Central Government increases the wage rate under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, there is a delay in applying the wage rate for various soil and water conservation works based on the catchment area of the state. Therefore, the following recommendations are being issued:
As soon as the wage rate is increased by notification under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme of the Central Government, the rates of the said wage in the State shall be applicable for the treatment/ works of soil and water conservation based on the catchment area from the same date.
(2) When the Central Government revises the rate of wages, the budgets of water conservation works in the State should be revised according to the revised rate of wages.
3. Increase in the rate of wages does not increase the scope of work. So, the increase in the budget is limited to the natural increase in the wage rate.
