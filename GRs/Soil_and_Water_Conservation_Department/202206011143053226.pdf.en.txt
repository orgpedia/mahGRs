8) Ma. Minutes of the meeting held under the Chairmanship of the Minister (Soil and Water Conservation) dated 1st February, 2021 and 1st February, 2022.
The Proposal:
Water conservation work is of high importance in view of the rainfall, availability of water and frequency of droughts in the state. Untimely rains have created a drought-like situation in the region, affecting agriculture. For this, the programme of constructing cement embankments in the drought prone taluks has been going on since 2012-13. Under this programme, funds were made available by sanctioning cement dams in drought prone taluks/ villages. Since 2014, under the River Rejuvenation Programme and Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan, funds were provided by sanctioning cement embankments in selected villages to overcome the scarcity situation. Under the River Rejuvenation Programme, the work of the Cement Nala Dam, which was approved in principle for three years from 2015-16 to 2017-18, has not been completed even after a period of 4 to 6 years

Decision to cancel the approval of works that have not yet started due to difficulties in undertaking new works. The meeting was held on 1 st February 2022 under the Chairmanship of the Minister (Soil& Water Conservation).
Considering the demand for taking up cement embankment works and as financial provisions are available, the date of 1st February 2022 has been fixed. In the meeting held under the chairmanship of the Minister (Soil and Water Conservation), it was decided to submit a detailed proposal to formulate a new policy for taking up new works of cement embankments on the lines of Mukhyamantri Jal Samvardhan Yojana by combining the existing guidelines/ government decisions under the cement embankment programme as it is necessary to take up works of new cement embankments.
3. In pursuance of the said decision, the matter of issuing new consolidated comprehensive guidelines under the" Jal Samriddhi Cement Dam Programme" was under consideration of the Government.
Government's decision:
Jal Samriddhi Cement Dam Programme: The Government is approving a new cement dam programme in the name of Jal Samriddhi Cement Dam Programme under Demand Number-ZH-5 Heading 4402 2799 for construction of new gated and non-gated CNB cement dams in the State.
Objective: 2.1 Strengthening of drinking water sources, including the creation of direct and indirect irrigation.
2.2 Drain/ rivulet (Denotified River) (width 50 m) less than) to prevent water stagnation and water retention.
2.3 Raising the ground water level by recharging the water in the aquifer.
2.4. To increase the production of crops by providing protected irrigation facilities to the crops.
3.1 Cementing works should be taken up on priority in villages facing scarcity of water supply through tankers and in the brackish water beds.
3.2 Cement embankments should be taken up only in Second and Third Order Recharge Zones (Class II and III recharge zones).

Because according to the geographical structure, 1st order streams are in the runoff zone, 2nd and 3rd order streams are in the recharge zone and 4th order larger streams are in the storage zone.
There are.
3.3 While determining the location of the cement concrete drain, the depth should be less than 2%.
3.4 1:25000 (Toposheet) type maps should be used while determining the location of the dam.
3.5 Based on the groundwater prospect maps, satellite maps of the groundwater survey and development system, it is possible to determine the favorable area/ location for recharge. Then on the basis of these maps and the groundwater line maps, the certificate of the competent authority from the groundwater survey and development system should be obtained for the site suitability.
The maximum length of the 3.6-inch cement structure should be 50m.
3.7 Cement embankments should be constructed in the catchment area up to 10 sq.km.
The concerned Superintending Engineer shall propose cement embankments in areas having catchment area of more than 10 sq.km. after ensuring that there is no outflanking after hydrological study. Ask for help from a professional if you need it.
3.8 Nullah A maximum of 1.20 m from the bottom of the bedrock to the bottom of the rock. The drain should be taken below the ground level. The maximum height above the ground level is 3 meters. Build a concrete wall up to the height.
3.9 The level of the concrete drain should not be higher than the ground level.
Also, the length of the rope should be equal to the length of the rope.
The length should not be extended unnecessarily.
10 Cement Bonds- by conducting a detailed survey and investigation to determine the location
Consider the following points to prepare your budget.
3.11 Cement embankment works should not be proposed in places where it is possible to take up embankments or other non-land acquisition projects of Kolhapur type, other than surveys.

4.1. Structures: Cement bunds should be constructed in M15 structure and temperature reinforcement should be used as per requirement.
4.2 Photographs of the work: At least 3 photographs of the work before the start of the cement construction, during the work and after the completion of the work should be geo-tagged with the presence of the field officer.
4.3 Laying of Information Board: After the work is done, the name of the department, name of the work, cost of the work, date of commissioning order, date of commencement of work, date of completion of work, name of the contractor etc. should be written in radium color as per the information board.
4.4 E-tendering: In order to ensure quality of works, at least 5 works or one e-tendering of works on the same nullah/ stream/ river should be done.
4.5 NOTE: A link will be provided on the website of the department to register all the work, on which all the information should be filled as follows.
Date, 3) Tender Date, 4) Commencement Order, 5) Name of the Contractor, 6) Cost of Work, 7) Commencement of Work, 8) Completion Date, 9) Payment of Contractor, 10) Contingent Cost, 11) Total Cost, 12) Three photographs of the work, etc.
