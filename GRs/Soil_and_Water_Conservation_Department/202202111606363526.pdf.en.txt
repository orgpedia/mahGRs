Introduction: The work of minor irrigation schemes in the state through the Water Conservation Department is taken from the District Annual Plan. From the financial year 2018-19, the annual plan of the district is from 0 to 250. Besides construction of irrigation facilities, repair works have also been taken up.
As per the Government Resolution No.GVO 2016/ PR No. 293/ JAL 1 dated 5th August, 2017 and subject to the provisions of Sec. 0 to 250 as on 20-07-2018. Guidelines have been issued regarding construction and repair of minor irrigation schemes with irrigation potential. Reference No.
The strength of the department is 600. Irrigation capacity has been increased.
So, 0 to 600 in case of LPA schemes of water conservation treatment construction. Guidelines are necessary for the construction and repair of irrigation capacity.
The 2. 0-600 vide Government Resolution dated 20-07-2018. Guidelines are being issued for irrigation potential.
The reference No. Newly increased from 0 to 600 according to the 1st century. The government was considering issuing new guidelines for the construction of minor irrigation tanks, storage tanks, village tanks, Pazar tanks, earthen drain bunds, cement drain bunds, storage bunds, maintenance bunds, sub-irrigation projects, etc. at the district level, government level, corporation level and other sources. Accordingly, the government has taken the following steps:
Government Decision: Part A) Guidelines regarding new construction:
The area of operation of Soil and Water Conservation Department has been increased from 250 hectares to 600 hectares. The limit of irrigation potential is calculated at the district level, government level, corporation level and other sources under the head (0-100). 101-250. 251-600. (a) Minor irrigation tanks, L.P. tanks, storage

Government Resolution No: LPO-2022/ PR No. 02/ WALL-1
New structures like ponds, village ponds, Pazar ponds, earthen nullah dams, cement nullah dams, storage dams, maintenance dams, lift irrigation projects, etc. can be taken up.
(b) Technical and financial analysis parameters in vogue in respect of new construction and as may be prescribed by the Government from time to time shall continue to apply. The new constructions shall be taken up with the administrative approval of the competent authority subject to the provision of funds available under that head and the procedures prescribed.
Preliminary investigation, survey and preparation of budget for schemes. The direct implementation of the plan
(iii) Government Resolution No. 2016/ P.O. for the management of the scheme after completion. No.293/ JAL-1 dated 05.08.2017 to be dealt with as per the provisions.
Part B) Guidelines regarding repairs: 1. Village ponds/ Pazar ponds/ Mud drain bunds/ Minor irrigation ponds/ Storage ponds/ L.P. ponds i. The repair work should be carried out including complete draining of the sludge, breakage of the sludge bar, breakage of the flak wall between the sludge bar and the sludge wall, large sludge from the inside of the sludge, deep potholes caused by water impact in the down stream, and techniques such as raft foundation should be used while doing such repair. If the sand bar is damaged, the sand bar should be repaired in the usual way. If the flak wall between the Pazar Lake and the Sandwa Bar is broken, the flak wall should be repaired by building with broken stone (Masonry Work) or a mediator in the traditional way.
In order to stop the erosion from the cut off trench on the inner side of the pond (if black soil is available in/ near the pond), the black soil available in the pond should be filled by taking the required depth of the trench on the inner side of the pond (Up Stream) and then water should be poured and compaction should be done. If black soil is not available near the pond, then an ISO certified HDPE sheet of 500 micron thickness in the size of the length and height of the removed fodder should be put in such a place and the removed soil/ soft soil/ acne/ (available) should be filled in the fodder. The height of the HDPE sheet should be fixed in accordance with the COT to completely block the water when laying such HDPE sheet.
iii. To prevent erosion from the lake wall/ bund, if black soil is available in/ adjacent to the pond/ bund, 60 cm of sand should be removed from the wall/ bund. A layer of black soil with a thickness of 30 cm. I.
Apply a layer of wax and then apply pressure. After that, it is available

Dry stone pitching should be done by using the existing stone and providing additional stone if required. If black soil is not available in the pond/ adjacent area, such ISO certified HDPE sheet should be put in the upper part of the wall. 60 cm on the wall.
A thick layer should be applied. Then dry stone pitching should be done using the available stone and if required additional stone should be provided. Thus the height of the HDPE sheet should be kept within the limit of 3 meters from the pond and the slope should be kept appropriate to the vertical wall of the dam and it should be ensured that the dry ash sheet remains stable on it.
If the main insulator is faulty/ there is a leakage on the side of the main insulator, the gate, hoist and stem rod in the system should be completely removed.
By digging the length of the system of the down stream of the scheme, the top wall of the system and the downstream side is completely removed and the new valve is connected to the MS pipe (900 m). m. Vyas) method should be proposed.
The length of the MS pipe in the system with the increased length of the upper and lower part of the dam should be covered with protection in the M-20 grade compressor.
E. Expansion Joint, Air Valve and 0.60 m as a control unit instead of a discharge system for passing water from the exhaust pipe and releasing irrigation water. Two butterfly valves of diameter should be proposed.
A. Fresh soil should be applied on both the sides of the system on the upper and lower side to maintain high quality and to prevent leakage from the soil. 1.00 m below and above by proposing ISO certified HDPE paper covering of 500 micron thickness in length. To work with a layer of impermeable soil of thickness and 1.00 m on this soil layer. Propose a layer of thick mulch and according to the approved cut the asphalt quarry should be done with spall.
As mentioned above, the MS pipe of the submersible valve control system is 900 m. I.
A proposal to take over the concept of VYASA from the Principal, Government College of Engineering, Pune, should be submitted immediately.
To store water in the lake to the full storage level, sewage should be built into the moderator M-15.

In addition to the above (i) to (iv), the necessary architectural modifications should be carried out according to the local conditions.
2. Cement drain bunds/ storage bunds/ maintenance bunds Architectural repairs: i. For taking preventive measures against cement embankment leakage, a 20 cm thick layer of cement should be applied on the upstream side of the cement embankment. 8 to 12 mm.
Thick steel should be used. For the base of this curtain 30 cm in hard rock.
The room should be dug. Such a curtain should be taken up to the top of the wall (bar) of the cement fence. If the stones are exposed in the down stream of the cement embankment, they should be reconstructed.
(ii) If the cement embankment is damaged, the soil in the submerged area of the embankment should be used for filling. Pressure should be applied to strengthen the filling.
If there are any holes near the wall in the basement, they should be filled by grouting/ pointing with cement concrete as needed. If the water cushion has been damaged due to the flow of water from the lower side of the cement embankment, then pointing should be done as per the need. Drainage should be deepened to increase the water level in the dam. The Department of Soil and Water Conservation, Government Circular No. Sankiran 2017/ Q. No.24/ Water-20D. Action to be taken as on 04.09.2017.
(iii) The structural repairs required in addition to (i) to (i) above shall be taken as per local conditions.
3. Irrigation ponds/ storage ponds/ former Malguzari ponds in the possession of Minor Irrigation Department (Zila Parishad) and (Water Conservation Department) should be repaired as per the instructions in the Government Decisions/ Government Circulars issued by the Department from time to time.
Construction of minor irrigation tanks, storage tanks, former Malguzari tanks, village tanks, Pazar tanks, earthen canal bunds, cement drain bunds, storage bunds, maintenance bunds, sub-irrigation projects which have been in operation for 10 years or more shall be eligible for repair. However, the period of 10 years for damage caused by natural calamities may be reduced as per the panchnama of the Revenue Department with the approval of the Regional Water Conservation Officer. Once repaired, the structures will not be allowed to be repaired again for the next 5 years.
(5) The minor irrigation schemes whose life expectancy is more than 60 years as mentioned in the Maharashtra Minor Irrigation Manual (No. 82) should not be taken up for revision.
In such cases, new water conservation treatments should be proposed instead of repair.
6. A single budget for a work (component) should be prepared treatment wise. The work should not be divided.
