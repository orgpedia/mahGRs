The proposal-
""" Proposals regarding\"" No-Demand No-Inquiry Certificate\"" of the officers of"""" Group-A and Group-B"""" cadre working in the subordinate offices of the Department of Agriculture and Padum, whose appointment and entire authority regarding disciplinary and administrative matters are under the control of the Department of Agriculture and Padum and the Commissioner, Agriculture, Pune, are submitted by the Commissionerate of Agriculture to this Department for getting appropriate feedback from this Department at the government level."""
With the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers, the Department of Soil and Water Conservation No. 1) is mentioned here. A new Administrative Division" Soil and Water Conservation" has been created vide Government Resolution dated 31.05.2017. Issue No. 7 (e) of the said Government Decision states that a total of 9967 posts from the Agriculture Department should be transferred to the Soil and Water Conservation Department along with the officers/ employees working as per' Return-I." However, at present, these officers/ employees have not been absorbed by the Soil and Water Conservation Department. Accordingly, all the concerned officers/ employees, concerned case papers/ documents are under the control of the Department of Agriculture and Padum and Commissioner, Agriculture, Pune. However, before the formation of this department, action has been taken against the concerned agricultural officers/ employees in some departmental inquiry cases regarding irregularities in soil and water conservation related matters.
In order to get proper feedback from this department at the government level regarding the no-demand or inquiry of the officers of the" Group-A and Group-B" cadre in the subordinate offices of the Agriculture Department, comprehensive proposals on most of the no-demand or inquiry certificates submitted to this department by the Agriculture Commissionerate are submitted along with the necessary documents of evidentiary value. In such cases, action is taken immediately and the concerned officers are issued their no-demand-no-inquest certificate without delay.
However, some proposals are submitted with very sketchy information or in the absence of necessary documents of evidentiary value. Requesting for necessary information regarding such proposals has to be followed up at the government level by repeatedly corresponding with the Agriculture Commissionerate.
The following important points are being mentioned regarding the issuance of No-Demand No-Inquiry Certificates of the above-mentioned concerned by this Department.
A) After the formation of this department, the meeting arrangement of the offices has been changed many times according to the administrative convenience. Therefore, the departmental inquiry cases in respect of irregularities in soil and water conservation due to negligence or other technical reasons will be considered.

The department has taken action. The possibility of non-availability of important documents in the archives in some or the other case of such administration cannot be ruled out.
(b) In order to expedite and facilitate the process of issuance of' No-Demand No-Inquiry Certificate' by this Department in the said background and to avoid any serious cases in the future after the issuance of No-Demand No-Inquiry Certificate by this Department, it is decided to submit the necessary important documents as evidence while submitting the proposal to this Department. (2) The circular referred to herein has been issued to the Commissioner of Agriculture.
e) However, it does not appear that the contents of this letter have been submitted to the government while submitting such a complete proposal. The government is in the process of submitting a complete proposal in this regard.
e) The officers concerned in the said cases are either retired or in some cases their date of retirement is in the near future. It is very important to dispose of the no-demand-no-investigation case of the above mentioned officer cadre submitted to this department as soon as possible.
In the above background, the following is indicated.
