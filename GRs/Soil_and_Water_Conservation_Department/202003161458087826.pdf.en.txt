Q. 1/194. 20/01/2019
Proposal L.P. Scheme Gopalwadi, Ta. Rajapur. The Ratnagiri Plan Budget Reference No. 1 has been accorded the original administrative sanction. The project was completed in 1993. It was found that there was a leakage in the 165 to 175 m of the scheme. To plug the leak, instead of the inverted sand filter at 155 to 185 m, it has been proposed to fill the shell and core in this area by digging up to a depth of 72 m.
In the case of repair of irrigation insulator instead of removing the filler on the upstream system, the entire length including the well in the upstream and downstream system should be increased by 800 m. I want to lay a diameter iron pipe, coating this pipe with HDPE from the inside and outside, filling the cementitious polymer grout in the cavity of the iron pipe and system, 800 meters below the dam. I have made a budget with the provision of installing two sluice valves of diameter etc. After the repair work, the storage capacity of the dam will be restored. Under this project, 113 hectares of land will be brought under irrigation. The proposed water storage capacity of Rajapur G. Ratnagiri is 1706 cusecs. Therefore, the matter of giving administrative approval to the special repair works of the said L.P. Lake was under consideration of the Government. The government has taken the following steps in this regard:
Government Decision: Rajapur G. Ratnagiri Special Revision Proposal of Rs. Administrative Sanction is being accorded to the proposal for an amount of Rs. 3,12,97, 296/- (Rupees Three Crores, Twelve Lakhs, Ninety Seven Thousand, Two Hundred and Fifty Seven only) subject to the following conditions.
