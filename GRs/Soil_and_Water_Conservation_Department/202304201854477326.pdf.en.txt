Department of Soil and Water Conservation, Government Resolution No. 2022/ No. 302/ Water-7, dated 03rd January, 2023.
Government Resolution, Department of Soil and Water Conservation No. Gamudh-2023/ No. 03/ Water-13, dated January 16, 2023.
Introduction: Maharashtra is the state with the highest number of dams and reservoirs in the country and due to the accumulation of silt in these dams every year, the storage capacity of the dams has reduced drastically. Removing the silt from these dams and spreading it in the fields will not only restore the original storage capacity of the dams but will also significantly increase the agricultural income. Keeping this in mind, the Government had implemented the" Sludge Free Dam Sludged Sewer" scheme under the Rural Development and Water Conservation Department, Government Decision dated May 6, 2017, to remove sludge from the dams in the state and use it in the field. The scheme will be implemented for a period of three years from the end of March 2021. The extension has been granted vide Government Order dated 16.01.2023. But since the silt accumulation in the water body is a permanent activity, it is proposed to implement the Silt Free Dam Siltation Sewer Scheme in the state permanently, not limited to the next 3 years.
Government Decision: Though the scheme of" Silt Free Dams, Sludge Free Sewers" has been implemented in Maharashtra remarkably well till 2021, it is very necessary to restart it, this year due to El Nino, rainfall is expected to be below average. Also, there is still about 44 crore cubic metres of silt in the reservoirs of Maharashtra. Also, in the past, when implementing the" Silt-free Dam, Sludge-Filled Oasis," the A.T.E. Chandra Foundation and B. Organizations such as J.S. (Jain Association of India) have specialized in it. Therefore, it is proposed to implement the scheme in partnership across the State and especially in the drought prone and aspirational districts of Vidarbha, Marathwada and North Maharashtra. In the previous scheme, the government used to pay only the fuel cost.
While the cost of the machine was borne by the NGOs, the cost of transportation and dispersal of silt was borne by the farmers themselves. Considering the importance of the scheme of' silt-free dam, silt-rich yard', it is necessary to implement it vigorously. Therefore, this time the government is proposing to pay for both the cost of machinery and fuel. It is also proposed to provide subsidy to such farmers so that small and marginal farmers can also take full advantage of this scheme. Therefore, the government has decided to implement the scheme of' Sludge-free Dam, Sludge-containing Sewar' in the state.

The salient features of the scheme are as follows:- Participation of local farmers:- In this scheme, the primary assumption is that small and marginal farmers will be given subsidy to transport silt in their fields and the majority farmers will be ready to transport silt at their own cost.
Public-private partnership: Expenditure on machinery and fuel required for desilting and subsidy to farmers will be met from the funds available from the government i.e. in the financial year 2023-2024 under the head of Jalyukt Shivar 2.0 scheme. In the subsequent financial year, a new head of account for the scheme should be taken and the cost of the scheme should be covered permanently. However, awareness about the benefits of" Silt Free Dam Sludged Sewer" and filling information on the app to ensure that it is correct will be done by the non-governmental organization.
Use of latest technology:- The process of geotagging the works done under the scheme, collecting information on the computer system of the scheme, etc. will be done through the Avani App. Avani App includes the following:- Water Storage-wise Storage Data.
Before and after pictures and videos of each site.
Farmers and their produce.
Water bodies and village wise farmer wise land holdings, quantity of silt carried and number of loaded trolleys (including tractor trolley details).
The total amount of fluid removedâ€¢ Daily data entry to understand the synergies between it and M. B recording will be checked.
District level information on where all the work is going on fast and which districts are lagging behind.
Aggregate information about the work done and the benefit to the farmers. Control:- The evaluation of the work done under this scheme will be done through the Avni app.
V. Evaluation The implementation of the scheme of" Silt Free Dams and Silt Seeds" will be assessed separately through a three-tier mechanism on the increase in water storage after one or two monsoons and the increase in productivity, production, income and net profit of farmers, raising the standard of living. This will be 1% of the project cost.
Water bodies with a benefit area of less than 600 hectares and more than 10 years old will be prioritized.
VII. Silt extraction shall be permitted and if sand has to be excavated for the purpose of increasing water storage, it shall be done as per the prevailing rules of the Revenue Department.
VIII. The Executive Engineer, Soil and Water Conservation Department shall be the implementing officer of the scheme at the district level.
Selection Process (Preparation of List): (i) A list of marginal/ marginal farmers (upto 1 hectare) and small farmers (1 to 2 hectares) who have taken silt will be prepared.

(4) If more than one non-governmental organization submits applications for desilting of a water body, the District Committee shall select one non-governmental organization for desilting of a water body after assessing the capacity of the concerned organization. The functions of this non-governmental organization will be as follows.
A) The agency will register the information of every water body in the district from which silt will be removed on the Avni app. Avani will verify that the information being filled on the app is correct from the other person working in the organization.
b) Training on Avani App will be provided to the employees to be appointed in the non-governmental organization by A.T.E. Chandra Foundation.
(5) On receipt of such proposal, the concerned Government machinery in such area shall certify the quantity of silt in the dam/ reservoir, etc. and accordingly, the budget shall be prepared by the Deputy Commissioner and the same shall be communicated to the concerned agency.

Priority should be given to minorities. Based on past experience, it has been shown that about 40 percent of the people who fit this criterion. So everyone will get a slice of this priority. However, if there is any dispute, the non-governmental organization should take responsibility for it.
10) The list of eligible farmers will be available on the Avni app. For this purpose, the extract of 7/12 and the panchnama should be submitted that the farmer is widowed, disabled, suicidal, marginalized and marginalized. The panchnama should include gram sevaks, zilla parishad teachers, talathi and any one employee.
7/12 and the panchnama will be uploaded on the Avni app. If the Avani App is not working or if there is any problem, the non-governmental organization should ensure that all the mentioned items are correct by taking information from the Avani App on the details showing the quantity of silt carried by each farmer and preparing a balance sheet every day with the amount of silt extracted.
13) The sludge to be transported is to be used by the farmers concerned in their fields and such sludge (minor mineral) cannot be sold or used for any other purpose.
14) After the completion of the de-silting work, a Gram Sabha should be held to discuss the final report and it should be approved by the Gram Sabha.
15) The Deputy Engineer shall submit the" Pass for Payment" (mentioning the name of the farmer, the quantity of grain, the subsidy) to the Executive Engineer for payment.
