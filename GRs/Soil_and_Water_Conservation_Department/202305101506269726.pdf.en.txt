Additional Commissioner Water Conservation and Chief Engineer, Soil and Water Conservation Regional Area, Nagpur No. Question- 1/ 578/ Government Budget/ Nagpur Division/ 2023D. 19.04.2023
The proposal was submitted to the government by the Mouzas of Jamnera, Kharashi, Khadki, Mandla, Bardhamaneri and Shirpur.
The work of deepening and widening of Arvi, G. Wardha is proposed in the Bakdi river area. Every year, the river overflows its banks, causing massive flooding in the villages and villages along its banks.

The heavy rains have caused extensive damage to crops and crops in some areas. This deepening will help in meeting the objectives of flood protection as well as water conservation by increasing the water storage available from the existing dam. The estimated cost of the work is Rs. 4,73,87, 001/- was under consideration of the Government for grant of administrative approval for the said work.
