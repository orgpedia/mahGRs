Preamble Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan is a very ambitious programme of the State Government which involves various watershed based soil and water conservation treatments. The consolidated guidelines were issued pursuant to the Government decision dated 23rd June, 2017 regarding the physical and financial parameters for the treatment of water storage in cement nala dams. The District Level Committee has been empowered to relax the physical criteria for such embankments if the cement drain embankments are required for water saturation of the villages under the Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan and fit into the economic parameters.
Under the Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan, the government was considering to improve the financial parameters for the treatment of water storage in the villages under the Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan by taking administrative approval for the construction of cement drain bunds and ancillary structures and for the smooth implementation of the works and to speed up the works under the Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan.
