4) Government Order Rural Development Department No: Tender-2021/ PR No.13/ Dam-4 dated February 22, 2023
Introduction: Since the water conservation works are benefiting the farmers by raising the ground water level, it is necessary to do these works before the rainy season. Also, as there is flood control and water storage, it is beneficial to carry out as many water conservation works as possible before the rainy season.
The Government has decided to reduce the tender notice period for works in the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana Watershed Development Component 2.0 Scheme by an order dated 25th January, 2023. However, this decision is far-fetched.
Along with the centrally sponsored scheme, the ambitious Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan of the state government, state schemes and schemes of the Water Conservation Corporation are also in the process of being taken up on a large scale. Among them, it has been decided to allow all the schemes of this department, which are at the administrative approval level and which are going to benefit from irrigation immediately after completion of the next monsoon season, to issue short-term tender notices on the lines of the Department of Rural Development under the e-tendering system as follows:
