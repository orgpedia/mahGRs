Since there are leakages in these Pazar lakes, the scheme needs to be revised for the safety of the dam. This scheme is in priority 2 in the framework of the Chief Minister's Water Conservation Plan. With the revision of the scheme, the original envisaged water storage is 823.64 cft and the original irrigation potential is 50 hectares. Therefore, the matter of giving administrative approval to these repair works was under the consideration of the government. The government has taken the following steps in this regard:
