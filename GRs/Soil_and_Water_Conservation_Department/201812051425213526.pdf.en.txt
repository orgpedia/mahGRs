In Kolhapur system of dams/ gated storage dams with irrigation potential of 0 to 100 ha, the depth of the dam is 0.50 m to 1.50 m. Guidelines for the construction of a convective membrane up to a height.........
The Government of Maharashtra
Department of Soil and Water Conservation
Government Circular No: Gated-2018/ PR No.275/ Water-1
Ministry, Mumbai- 400 032.
Date is December 5, 2018.
Reference: 1. The Chief Engineer, Minor Irrigation (Water Conservation), Pune and all Regional Water Conservation Officers. Secretary (Water Resources). As agreed in the meeting held on 25.10.2018.
Introduction: There are approximately 11,000 Kolhapur type dams/ gated dams in the state maintained by the Soil and Water Conservation Department. All the common drains of this Kolhapur style/ gated dam are 0.50 to 1.50 m from the lake. If the construction is done with a dielectric membrane up to the height, then the post-monsoon flow will be at least 0.50 to 1.50 m in the embankment. Water will be stored at high altitudes. This will also help in preventing rain. For this, it is necessary to calculate the flood discharge according to all the normal drain pools by re-surveying the embankment according to the required flood lift. The construction of the dam is 0.50 to 1.50 m. Water will be available at high altitudes. Kolhapur method of embankment/ gated storage embankment is 0.50 m to 1.50 m. Chief Engineer, Minor Irrigation (Water Conservation), Pune and all Regional Water Conservation Officers were present. Secretary (Water Resources). The Regional Officers have agreed in the meeting held on 25.10.2018. The issue of issuing guidelines on the subject wall was under consideration of the government. Accordingly, the following Government Order has been issued:
Part A) New C.P. Embankments/ Gated Storage Embankments 1 to 2 m. Guidelines for construction with centrifugal curtain of height to meter height: (i) 0 to 100. In the new construction of Kolhapur style dam/ gated storage dam on small rivers and local drains other than notified rivers within the limit of irrigation capacity, the Sill Level can be proposed by increasing the height of the common drain tank by 1 to 2 meters depending on the regional situation.

Government Resolution No: Gated-2018/ PR No.275/ Jal-1
(ii) All common drains shall be 1 to 2 m from the pond. The technical and financial parameters applicable to new construction in the Sill Level Proposal will be applicable as per the prevailing work and as determined by the Government from time to time.
(ii) All common drains shall be 1 to 2 m from the pond. The new constructions of the Sill Level should be taken up with administrative approval of the competent authority as per the provision of funds available and depending on the modalities envisaged.
(iv) Sill Levels of 1 to 2 m height shall be included, taking into account the availability of water, concept and sedimentation.
(v) Considering the availability of water, the conservation work done in the catchment area should be taken into account and the height should be fixed accordingly. Make sure there is no outflanking.
Part B) Construction of Condensate Curtain of 1 to 1.5 m in existing Kolhapur System Embankments/ Gated Embankments:
The general guidelines for installation of a concentric screen of 1 to 1.50 m between the existing Kolhapur type of embankment/ gated embankment are as follows.
from 0 to 100. The District Water Conservation Officer (LWE) will be responsible for determining the location of all the irrigation potential dams/ gated dams. A committee of the District Water Conservation Officer (Water Conservation Department) and the concerned Sub-Divisional Water Conservation Officer should be formed and this committee should jointly inspect and determine the embankment on which it is possible to close the gates with a height of 1 to 1.5 meters. A site inspection report should be prepared in this regard.
(iii) While determining the height, the work done in the catchment area in the last 10 years and the amount of water received accordingly should be taken into account. However, make sure that there is no outflow.
(iv) The Sub-Divisional Water Conservation Officer concerned shall take action to obtain the consent of the concerned Gram Panchayat for closing the shutters of the dam sites determined for the closure of the shutters. If the consent resolution of the Gram Panchayat is not received, no action should be taken to close the gullies for such a dam.
The embankment should be re-conceptualized with a curtain while incorporating a curtain of 1 to 1.5 m height above the normal drain level in the existing embankment.
The construction of the construction should be done taking into account the availability of water and the catchment area.
" to one. A single budget should be prepared for the construction of the concentric screen in the dam/ gated storage dam. The work should not be fragmented.

Government Resolution No: Gated-2018/ PR No.275/ Jal-1
IV. Construction of Gated Storage Dam/ Co. P. Dam should be treated as repair work and for this purpose, the Department of Soil and Water Conservation has issued Government Resolution No. The financial norms and procedures will be applicable from July 20, 2018.
V. Proposals for construction of concentric screens should be taken up only with the technical and administrative approval of the competent authority as per the provision of funds available.
(vi) Before commencing the construction work, photographs should be taken and geotagged during and after the work is completed.
Part C: Reschedule of Gates in the Dam from 0 to 100 H.P.C.
In this regard, the District Water Conservation Officer should prepare the Gate Operation Schedule of the gates of the dams taking into account the flood discharge planned according to the new common drain tank. Be careful that the out flanking does not pose any danger to the construction.
Konkan region or the region where rainfall is more than 2500 mm. The gates of K.P. Barriers/ Gated Barriers at all other places, except those in the region. 30% should be closed by September 30, 60% by September 30 and 100% by October 15. So that water will be available in the dam after 30th September due to the return rains.
Gates should be closed in the Konkan region or areas where more than 2500 mm of rain falls, as per the prevailing time (till October 15).
Part D) Establishment and regular maintenance of water use agency after the construction of infrastructure including curtains:- The Government shall take decision in this regard. Action to be taken as on 20.7.2018.
