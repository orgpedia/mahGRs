Department of Water Resources As it is mandatory to have a registered contractor from the Public Works Department for works up to Rs. 1.50 crore under paragraph 24.4 of the Government Decision dated 30/11/2018, no change is proposed in the existing procedure for providing works to educated unemployed engineers and labor cooperatives. 24/04/2015 The orders of the Government Decision should be followed. Instructions have been given.
Dated 27/09/2018. By the decision of the Government of Rs. The allocation of works up to Rs 30 lakh should be made in the ratio of workers cooperatives, educated unemployed engineers and qualified registered regular contractors. Public Works Department As per the Government decision dated 20/05/2021, Rs. Instructions have been given to adopt e-tendering for works involving an amount of Rs.10 lakh (inclusive of all taxes).
Since the works of the Water Conservation Department are in a scattered form and if the work is done by small contractors or in proportionate quantities, it will affect the quality of the works. Small contractors have inadequate engineering resources, skilled workforce, engineers and insufficient experience, which affects the quality of work. As a result, despite the construction of large-scale water conservation structures, water does not accumulate in the concept, and the post-construction maintenance of the construction is not repaired despite giving a defect liability period. There is no water supply or irrigation. Moreover, a small contractor cannot establish a water utility after construction and repair the maintenance of the construction for the next 5 years after construction.
However, it was under the consideration of the Government that the quality of construction of the schemes under the Soil and Water Conservation Department should be excellent, so that good quality contractors would do the work and the quality of construction work would be good, so that the tender process of the provincially approved schemes should be done by clubbing the schemes above the combined cost of Rs. 3.00 crore.
Government decision: Rs. 3.00 crore or more, the contractor shall be bound to provide quality engineering equipment, skilled workers, officials and after completion of the works, establish a water utility on the works, maintain the structures for 5 years after construction, repair and transfer the works to the water utility and so on. Henceforth, the tender proceedings for the construction and repair works of new works under the Department of Soil and Water Conservation, worth Rs. 3.00 crore or more, should be removed. The tender system will be applicable for works at the government level and corporation level.
