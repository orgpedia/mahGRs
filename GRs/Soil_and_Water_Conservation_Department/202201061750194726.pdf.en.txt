GOVERNMENT DECISION NO. DATED 13.7.2017 2) The Managing Director, Maharashtra Water Conservation Corporation, Aurangabad vide letter No. Majasam/ Tansha-6/ Visasivipra/ 50/ 2018 dated 18.1.2018 3) Letter No. 1726/ Lesha/ Sun-2021 dated 14.09.2021
the Government Purifier
The progress of works under the Vidarbha Intensive Irrigation Development Programme (VIDP). 1 Under the decision of the Government here have been transferred under the various headings of this department.
2. GPL Department issues Government Resolution regarding the responsibility of 7 schemes in Nagpur. As on 13/09/2017, the Government had accepted and directed to provide funds under the head of accounts of the Corporation. However, since these schemes are owned by the Zilla Parishad and the Corporation incurs huge expenditure on these schemes, the question of ownership of the schemes may arise. Also, the Maharashtra Water Conservation Corporation has said that proper entries cannot be taken in the Asset Register of the corporation and it is an objectionable matter from the point of view of accounting. vide letter dated 18.01.2018.
3. In view of these considerations, in order to provide funds for the schemes already undertaken by the Government, Reference No. The following table of the accompanying Annexes to the Governing Decision No. 1 should be read as further amended.
