Government Circular No: PARAMAP-2018/ PR No.277/ JAL-1
Ministry, Mumbai- 400 032.
Date: 15th of June 2019
The Proposal:
Minor irrigation (water conservation) schemes with an irrigation capacity of 0 to 250 hectares are implemented by the Water Conservation Department at the level of Zilla Parishad Corporation and the Government.
At the government level, it has been observed that most of the proposals in the range of 0 to 100 hectare irrigation potential are being submitted to the government for administrative approval. Different levels of liability are not considered while submitting the proposal. Also, the provisions of the District Councils Act, 1961 are not being followed. At the time of submission of proposals, the hydrological and hydrological survey, exploration and conceptualization, land acquisition, budgets, tariff differentiation, profitability ratio, etc. are being submitted without the approval of the competent authority. Therefore, the proposal is pending for approval. In this regard, the government was considering issuing instructions to be taken into consideration while submitting proposals for administrative approval in the range of 0 to 600 hectares of irrigation capacity. Accordingly, the following Government Orders have been issued:
(a) Hydrology and water planning
Government Water Resources Circular No. Narrow 2002/17/02) viz. Water availability certificate should be obtained from the Chief Engineer, Hydrological Project Office or from the authorized competent authority as on 24.12.2003.
(ii) Certification at the level of Chief Engineer by conducting water study, sedimentation study, stock planning and flood study as per requirement.
III. With the improved Penman method, the total water consumption should be planned and certified at the level of Chief Engineer by removing the season-wise and crop-wise water requirement.
IV. Details of demand for non-irrigation, if any, to be added. These details should be verified by the Superintendent Engineer.
