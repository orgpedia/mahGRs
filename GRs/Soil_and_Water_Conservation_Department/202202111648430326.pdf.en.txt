Procedure to be followed for survey and investigation work of soil and water conservation treatment structures.
The Government of Maharashtra
Department of Soil and Water Conservation,
Government Circular No. Sankirna-2021/ PR No. 432/ Water-1
Mantralaya, Mumbai 400 032
Date: February 11, 2022
The Proposal:
It has come to the notice of the government that the survey and exploration works in the state are being undertaken by the field machinery under the Soil and Water Conservation Department on a large scale and without the approval of any competent authority, thereby creating undue liability.
It has been observed that in the absence of in-depth survey/ investigation, the cost of the project has increased substantially. In such a situation, after obtaining administrative approval and taking timely cognizance of the increase in project cost due to changes in the concept, changes in scope, difficulties in land acquisition, etc. and the need for revised administrative approval to the project, the increase in project cost will be within the limits and the revised administrative approval report of the project will be prepared in a proper manner. Alternatively, it can be approved in due time. In respect of the actual survey, Government Circular No.Survey-2017/ PR No. 18/ Jal-4, Dy. 30th November, 2018 and Survey 2020/ S.No.98/ Jal-4, D. Certain instructions have been issued vide letter dated 28.02.2020. However, the issue of issuing detailed guidelines for survey and investigation work was under the consideration of the government, so the following instructions are being issued by cancelling the above two letters.
Circular: During administrative approval, often a project is approved by conducting a preliminary survey and changes are made after a detailed survey. The project budget should not be considered for technical approval without detailed survey and investigation to prevent such incidents. A survey should be conducted for this. The expenditure budget of the survey should be approved in advance by the competent authority.
(ii) While making detailed project estimates, administrative approval of the original works should not be proposed without a thorough investigation of the ground, bed and watershed considerations. In case of lapses due to faulty investigation, the responsibility should be fixed on the concerned Water Conservation Officer, Sub-Divisional Water Conservation Officer and District Water Conservation Officer.
After receiving the detailed survey and investigation report (pre-feasibility report), it should be approved by the competent authority.

Government Circular No: SANKIRN-2021/ PR No.432/ JAL-1
Administrative approval for preparation of Detailed Project Estimates should be decided if the feasibility report is correct/ successful.
At the time of administrative approval of the project, it will be necessary to first conceptualize the Government Engineering College/ Central Conceptualization Association, Nashik through the competent mechanism of the project's sub-project.
If the survey is to be done on demand (people's representatives/ essential works), the survey should be undertaken by the officers/ employees under the department.
If the survey work is to be undertaken by a private agency/ agency due to insufficient manpower, prior approval of the Controlling Officer (Regional Water Conservation Officer) should be obtained.
8. Tender system should be adopted as per the prevailing procedure for survey work.
(9) No demand for survey benefit shall be made unless the detailed budget required for administrative approval of the project for which the pre-project survey has been conducted has been received from the competent authority.
After the availability of the budget as above, the District Water Conservation Officer shall submit the demand proposal in the prescribed form to the Government through the Controller (concerned Regional Water Conservation Officer) as per Government Circular dated 09/08/2016.
Be sure to follow the instructions carefully.
