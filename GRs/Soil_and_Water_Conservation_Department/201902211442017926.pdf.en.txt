Preamble: Water conservation projects with irrigation potential of 0 to 600 hectares in the State are under the purview of Soil and Water Conservation Department. Out of these, projects with irrigation potential of 0 to 100 hectares are taken up by 03 separate authorities namely State Level Schemes, Water Conservation Corporation Schemes and Zilla Parishad Schemes. For them, the authority/ body which has given administrative approval to the projects is meant to provide the funds permissible for the projects as per the said sanction order. However, in cases where payment of land acquisition is pending for some of the completed old projects, there are now cases of payment of enhanced compensation along with interest as per the prevailing Land Acquisition Act. Also, the court confiscation, recommendation of the Lok Ayukta, the settlement decision in the Mahalok Adalat are being received for the payment of this fund, and the project victims are also being demanded through various issues. In this regard, due to lack of funds from some district councils, they have given administrative approval for the pending land acquisition funds.
