According to the budget, the proposal was submitted to the government. Akkalkot is proposed to be constructed on a local drain flowing at a distance of 2.00 km from Solapur. Converted storage pond Akkalkot G. Solapur was completed in about 1972 AD. This lake has been constructed under the RHO. The storage capacity of the reservoir is 310 cubic metres.
Converted storage pond. Akkalkot, Solapur: The Akkalkot G. Solapur project is facing a huge water leakage and there is no water storage in the project and it is having an adverse effect on irrigation.
As the Maharashtra-Karnataka state highway passes through the vicinity of the lake, the main fill of the dam has been damaged due to road widening. After being informed by the villagers, a physical inspection of the Pazar lake was conducted and a large number of leaks were found from the base and fill of the Pazar lake due to improper use of the material used for the lake. It is recommended that the existing Pazar Lake should be converted into a storage lake as the prescribed life of this Pazar Lake has expired. The proposed storage capacity of the reservoir is 310 cusecs and the irrigated area is 91 cusecs. The government has taken the following steps in this regard:
GOVERNMENT DECISION: Administrative approval is being accorded to the proposal for conversion of storage tank at Mauje Konhali in Akkalkot Taluka of Solapur district at a total cost of Rs. 4,87,43, 802/- (Rupees Four Crores Eighty Eight Lakhs Thirty Three Thousand Eight Hundred Two only) subject to the following conditions.
