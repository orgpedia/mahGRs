The Proposal: -
About 52% of the area in the state is dryland and precipitation is WATT. Various watershed-based soil and conservation treatments are being implemented in the state under the Central and State Award Schemes with the prime objective of stopping large-scale land erosion in the region, increasing groundwater storage by controlling watershed erosion, providing protected irrigation for agriculture, strengthening of village level drinking water sources, increasing and sustaining the gross production of crops by increasing the productivity of the land.
2. At present, various watershed based soil water conservation treatment works are being carried out by various departments in the state under schemes like Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan 2.0, Centrally Sponsored Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana - Watershed Development Component 2.0, Kinetic Watershed Development Programme, Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY), Maghel Toh Farms, etc.

3. Subject to reference, officers of the Department of Agriculture shall be called upon to carry out the works of soil and water conservation. The powers of technical and administrative approval were granted by a Government Decision dated 21 April 2009. However, at present, there is an increase in the cost of construction materials, labour prices, and fuel inflation, leading to an increase in the amount of the works budget. As a result, there has also been an increase in the treatment of soil and water conservation, as there has also been a flood in matters such as goods and services tax, ownership money, workers' welfare fund, and insurance.
4. Therefore, the Government concerned may take a decision to fix technical parameters for the treatment of soil and water conservation. The Committee constituted under 07.02.2012 is headed by Commissioner Agriculture, Maharashtra State, Pune. The meeting was held on 03 July 2023. In the meeting, it was recommended to enhance the powers of the officers of the Agriculture Department to grant technical and administrative clearances for soil and water conservation works, with reference no. Named in 7. The proposal has been submitted to the government for approval under the letter of 14.08.2023. Accordingly, the government was considering increasing the authority of the Agriculture Department to grant technical clearance to officials for soil and water conservation works.
The government's decision:
The Government is approving the following amendments in the financial powers of the officers of the Department of Agriculture to grant technical and administrative approval to soil conservation and water conservation treatments for watershed development.
