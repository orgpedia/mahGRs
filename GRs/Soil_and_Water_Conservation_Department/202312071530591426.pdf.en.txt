Read: 1. Soil and Water Conservation Department Government Resolution Sibanka-2022/ No. 212/ Water 1, D. 17.04.2023 2.

The proposal of Moze Moser. Naar and Naadgavan. The work of deepening and widening of nullah at Digras G. Yavatmal is proposed. Due to heavy rains in the catchment areas, the rivers and rivulets are in spate and flood water is flowing into the river from both sides. Due to the sloping nature of this river/ nullah, the erosion of the river/ nullah has been greatly reduced by accumulating silt. As a result, the discharge capacity of the river has decreased. The heavy rains have caused extensive damage to crops and crops in some areas. For this, the government was considering widening and deepening of the canal on a trial basis. Similarly, a causeway with gates has been proposed so that after the end of the rainy season, it will be possible to block the water from the gate and the farmers will use the causeway to go from one end of the drain to the other. This deepening will help in meeting the objectives of flood protection as well as water conservation by increasing the water storage available in the existing embankment and by adding additional water for recharge. These works are being taken up on a pilot basis in Arvi, Ashti and Karanja taluks of Wardha district on the lines of works sanctioned under various government decisions. The estimated cost of the work is Rs. 2,03,68, 445/- was under consideration of the Government for grant of administrative approval for the said work.
Government Decision: Naar and Naadgavan. The total cost of the project is Rs. 2,03,68, 445/- (Rupees Two Crores Three Lakhs
