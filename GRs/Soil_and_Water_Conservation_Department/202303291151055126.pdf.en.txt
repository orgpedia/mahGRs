In order to restore the irrigation potential by preserving and repairing the completed water conservation schemes in the state, the Chief Minister's Water Conservation Scheme is being implemented under the relevant Schedule No. 1. K.P. Bandhara Savangi Parivartane Ta.
Jafrabad, G. Jalna scheme has been completed in the year 1999. Due to heavy floods in the heavy rains in Jaffrabad taluka, the agricultural land on both sides of the dam has been damaged due to the erosion of the agricultural land on the river bank to the river level. As a result, the farmers have not been able to irrigate their fields for the last three years. Hence, the proposal has been put on hold. This scheme is in priority 2 in the framework of the Chief Minister's Water Conservation Plan. With the revision of the scheme, the original envisaged water storage is 885 cft and the original irrigation potential is 141 hectares. Therefore, the matter of giving administrative approval to these repair works was under the consideration of the government.
Government Decision: To transfer the Koppa Dam under the Chief Minister's Water Conservation Scheme. Jafrabad, G. Jalna Rs. 4,90,55, 011/- (Rupees Four Crores Ninety Lakhs Fifty Five Thousand)
