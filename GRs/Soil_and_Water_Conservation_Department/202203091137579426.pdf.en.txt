According to the proposal submitted to the government, the scheme will be implemented. Aatpadi is proposed to be constructed on a flowing local drain at a distance of 2.00 km from G.Sangli. Pazar lake has been drained. Atpadi (Group No. 517.518) G. Sangli was completed in about 1972. This lake has been constructed under the RHO. The storage capacity of the lake is 340 cft. After being informed by the villagers, a physical inspection of the Pazar lake was conducted and a large number of leaks were found from the base and fill of the Pazar lake due to improper use of the material used for the lake. Large cracks have also been found on the top of the lake. It is recommended that the existing Pazar Lake should be converted into a storage lake as the prescribed life of this Pazar Lake has expired. The proposed storage capacity of the reservoir is 340 cusecs and the irrigated area is 80 cusecs. Accordingly, a proposal for granting administrative status to the converted storage tank was submitted to the government through a letter. The government has taken the following steps in this regard:
GOVERNMENT DECISION: The total cost of the converted storage tank at Mauje Palsakhel in Atpadi Taluka of Sangli district is Rs. 4,88,39, 303/- (Rupees Four Crores, Eighty Eight Lakhs Forty Nine Thousand Three Hundred and Thirty Three only).
