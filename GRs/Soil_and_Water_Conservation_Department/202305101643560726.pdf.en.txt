The proposal was submitted to the government of Mauja Bhishnur and Nawabpur taluka. The work of deepening and widening of Ashti G. Wardha Nullah is proposed in the area on the branch of Wardha River. Every year, the river overflows its banks, causing massive flooding in the villages and villages along its banks. Due to the very low slope of this river/ nullah, the erosion of the river/ nullah has been greatly reduced by accumulating silt. As a result, the capacity of the river has been reduced. The heavy rains have caused extensive damage to crops and crops in some areas. This deepening will help in meeting the objectives of flood protection as well as water conservation by increasing the water storage available from the existing embankments and by adding additional water for recharge. The estimated cost of the work is Rs. 35,23,353/- was under consideration of the Government for grant of administrative sanction for the said work.
