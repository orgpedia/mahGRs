Ministry, Mumbai- 400 032.
The date: July 20, 2018.
Introduction: The work of minor irrigation schemes in the state through the Water Conservation Department is taken from the District Annual Plan. From the financial year 2018-19, the annual plan of the district is from 0 to 250. Along with the construction of small water reservoirs, repair work has also been included. Guidelines for construction of Minor Irrigation Schemes have been issued vide Government Resolution No.GVO 2016/ PR No. 293/ JAL 1 dated 5th August, 2017.
from 0 to 250. The government was considering issuing new guidelines for the construction of minor irrigation tanks, storage tanks, village tanks, Pazar tanks, earthen drain dams, cement drain dams, storage dams, maintenance dams, sub-irrigation projects, etc. Accordingly, the government has taken the following steps:
Government Decision: Part A) Guidelines for new constructions: Construction of minor irrigation tanks, storage tanks, village tanks, Pazar tanks, earthen drain bunds, cement drain bunds, storage bunds, maintenance bunds, sub-irrigation projects, etc. can be taken up under the head Construction of Minor Irrigation Bonds within the limit of 1 to 250 hectare irrigation capacity.
The technical and financial standards that the prevailing government will determine from time to time in relation to new construction work will continue to apply. Different economic and technical parameters have been prescribed for various water conservation works mentioned in paragraph 1. The new constructions should be taken up with the administrative sanction of the competent authority depending upon the provision of funds and the procedures prescribed.
Government Decision No. 2016/ p. No.293/ Water- 1D. The guidelines were issued on August 5, 2017. Action should be taken accordingly.

Part B) Guidelines for the Revision of the
1) Pazar Lake/ Village Lake/ Mud Drain Dam.
(i) Repair work should be carried out in areas with complete erosion of the silt, breakage of the silt bar, breakage of the flak wall between the silt bar and the silt wall, large silt on the inner side of the silt, deep potholes caused by the impact of water in the down stream and techniques like raft foundation should be used while doing such repair.
If the sand bar is damaged, the sand bar should be repaired in the usual way.
If the flak wall between the Pazar Lake and the Sandwa Bar is broken, the flak wall should be repaired by building with broken stone (Masonry Work) or a mediator in the traditional way.
(ii) To prevent erosion from the cut off trench on the inner side of the pond (if black soil is available in/ adjacent to the pond), the required depth should be taken from the inner side of the pond (Up Stream) and the black soil available in the pond should be filled in the trench and then water should be poured and compaction should be done. If black soil is not available near the pond, a HDPE ISO certified sheet of 500 micron thickness in the size of the length and height of the removed fodder should be put in such a place and the removed soil/ soft soil/ acne/ (available) should be filled in the fodder. The height of the HDPE sheet should be fixed in accordance with the COT to completely block the water when laying such HDPE sheet.
(iii) To prevent erosion from the lake wall/ bund, if black soil is available in/ adjacent to the pond/ bund, a layer of black soil of 60 cm thickness and 30 cm thickness shall be applied on the wall/ bund. A layer of wax should be applied and then pressed properly. After that dry stone pitching should be done using the available stone and if required additional stone should be provided. Also, if there is no black soil available in the pond/ vicinity, such HDPE sheet which has been put in the COT should be put in the upper part of the wall.
60 cm thick layer of acne should be given on the wall/ bund. Then dry stone pitching should be done using the available stone and if required additional stone should be provided. Thus the height of the HDPE sheet should be kept within the limit of 3 meters from the pond and the slope should be kept appropriate to the vertical wall of the dam and it should be ensured that the dry ash sheet remains stable on it.

(iv) The structural repairs required in addition to the above (i) to (iii) shall be undertaken as per local conditions.
2) Construction of Cement Drainage Dams/ Storage Barrages:
(i) Cement bunds A 20 cm thick cement screen should be placed on the upstream side of the cement bund to prevent leakage. The thickness of the steel should be between 8 to 12 mm. The base of this curtain should be made to penetrate into the hard rock to a depth of 30 cm. Such a curtain should be taken up to the top of the wall (bar) of the cement fence. If the stones are exposed in the down stream of the cement embankment, they should be reconstructed.
ii) If the cement embankment is damaged, the soil in the submerged area of the embankment should be used for filling. Pressure should be applied to strengthen the filling. If there are any holes near the wall in the basement, they should be filled by grouting/ pointing with cement concrete as needed. If the water cushion has been damaged due to the flow of water from the lower side of the cement embankment, then pointing should be done as per the need. Drainage should be deepened to increase the water level in the dam. For this, the Department of Soil and Water Conservation, Government Circular No. 2017/ No. 24/ Water-20D. Action to be taken as on 04.09.2017.
In addition to the above (i) to (ii), the necessary architectural repairs should be carried out according to the local conditions.
3) Irrigation ponds/ storage ponds/ former Malguzari ponds in the possession of Minor Irrigation Department (Zilla Parishad) and (Water Conservation Department) should be repaired as per the instructions in the Government Decisions/ Government Circulars issued by the Department from time to time.
Construction of minor irrigation tanks, storage tanks, ex-Malguzari tanks, village tanks, Pazar tanks, earthen drain bunds, cement drain bunds, storage bunds, maintenance bunds, sub-irrigation projects which have been in operation for a period of 10 years or more shall be eligible for repair. However, the period of 10 years for damage caused by natural calamities can be reduced with the approval of the Collector. Once repaired, the structures will not be allowed to be repaired again for the next 5 years.
5) A single budget of a work (components) should be prepared treatment-wise. The work should not be fragmented.
6) The cost of construction/ treatment to be repaired should be limited to 20% of the prevailing financial parameters.

(i) If the cost of repair of construction/ treatment of structures to be repaired under Minor Irrigation Department (Zila Parishad) and Minor Irrigation Department (Jal Sanrakshan) is more than 20% of the prevailing financial parameters, the District Water Conservation Officer (Water Conservation Department) and District Water Conservation Officer (G. (e) It will be necessary to jointly inspect the site and determine the terms of the work by taking inspection notes. This site inspection note will be required to provide a detailed reason for not being able to revise the LP scheme to an amount less than 20% of the prevailing financial parameters.
Also, the District Superintending Agriculture Officer/ District Soil Conservation Officer will be required to inspect the work under the Soil Conservation Department and take inspection notes and determine the matters of repair.
