Government Decision No. 2011/ No. 127/ Jal-7, dated 03rd July, 2013. JASIA-2014/ Q.No.203/ JAL-7, dated 5th December, 2014. JASIA-2022/ PR No.302/ JAL-7 dated 03.01.2023
Introduction: In the state of Maharashtra, the irregularity of rainfall during the period of crop growth and the interruption in rainfall leads to a continuous shortage-like situation, which has a major impact on the agricultural sector.
Considering the limited irrigation facilities in the state, large extent of erosion prone area, large amount of light and degraded land, uncertain and fragmented rainfall, increasing uncertainty in the agricultural sector, Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan was launched to overcome the scarcity situation. It was implemented from 2015-16 to 2018-19. Also Reference No. Under the above Government decision, it has been decided to implement Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan 2.0.
Under the Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan Phase-I, a total of 22593 villages have been covered in the campaign. Out of these, 6,32,896 works have been completed and 20,544 villages have been covered. About 27 lakh TCM has been achieved due to the work done under the mission.
By creating water storage capacity, protected irrigation facilities were created for about 39 lakh hectares of agriculture, bringing sustainability in agricultural productivity.
The life expectancy of the treatment undertaken in the villages where Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan Phase-I has been implemented, such as levelling/ deep levelling, diversion drain, graded bunding/ compartment bunding/ contour bunding, gabion structure, earthen drain bund, winding embankment, farmlands, etc., has been fixed from 5 to 23 years. Some of the works done under Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan Phase-I have taken more than 8 years. The farmers have got 100 percent benefit from the soil and water conservation works done in the Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan Phase-1. At present, the farmers are not getting the benefit of this structure as the life span of the structure is over. Therefore, the possibility of farmers being deprived of benefits cannot be ruled out.

Government Decision No. JASHIYA-2023/ PR. No. 302/ JAL-7 The Government was considering to include maintenance, repair and restoration of capacity of soil and water conservation works done through various schemes through convergence in Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan Phase-I in Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan 2.0.
Government Decision: In order to ensure efficient utilization of the remedial schemes implemented in the villages under the Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan Phase-1 and to restore the water structures therein, the Government is approving the inclusion of maintenance/ conservation and capacity restoration of the remedial schemes under the Department of Soil and Water Conservation in the Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan 2.0.
The funds earmarked for maintenance and repair should be utilised on priority for taking records of works done in the entire catchment area, removal of encroachments and widening of nullahs, enumeration through land records for removal of encroachments, demarcation of nullahs/ nullahs.
The value of labour is also considered in public participation. Priority should be given to take up maintenance and repair works under MNREGA. If the skilled cost of MGNREGA is more than 40%, then more amount should be spent from Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan 2.0.
4. Since it has been a long time since the works of Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan Phase-I were completed, it is necessary to preserve, repair and maintain these works. It is expected that 10 percent of the funds will be made available from the respective Gram Panchayat funds for the area where the work has been done.
5. The expenditure incurred for the treatment/ maintenance of soil and water conservation works in the villages where Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyaan Phase-I has been implemented will be made available under Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyaan- 2.0 from the account head 4402 2781.
