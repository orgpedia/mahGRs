the Government Circular
Complaints received by the government regarding schemes / works being implemented by the Soil and Water Conservation Department are forwarded to the respective offices of the Regional Vigilance and Quality Control Officer, Regional Vigilance and Quality Control Team, Nagpur, Pune, Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, as per this jurisdiction. The documents / records required for investigation of these complaints / inspection of works are not immediately made available by the concerned field offices (Regional Water Conservation Officer, District Water Conservation Officer, Sub-Divisional Water Conservation Officer) to the vigilance teams without any ASA reason. This is highly objectionable and disruptive to administrative discipline. Moreover, it has come to the notice of the government that this is delaying the submission of the preliminary vigilance report by the vigilance teams to the government. Against this background, the following suggestions are being made: -
1. Except in cases where there is reasonable cause to be satisfied from the receipt of a letter from the Regional Vigilance B Scale Control Officer, Vigilance B Scale Control Team, Nagpur, Pune, Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar Offices (Vigilance Team), the records / documents relating to the inquiry / inspection shall be made available to the vigilance teams by the Head of the concerned field office within one office day.
The concerned vigilance teams shall submit to the Government a proposal for disciplinary action as per rule 10 of the Maharashtra Civil Services (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1979 against the concerned field office heads for not furnishing records relating to vigilance / investigation within the prescribed time.
3. Submit a preliminary inquiry report to the Government within 30 days (15 days if the complaint is serious) after inquiry by the concerned vigilance teams in accordance with the complaints received for vigilance from the government level. Also, in cases where directions have been given to file a draft charge sheet, the draft charge sheet along with supporting documents should be submitted to the government within 15 days.
