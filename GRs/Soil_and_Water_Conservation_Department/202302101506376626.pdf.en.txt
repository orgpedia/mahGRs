In order to restore the irrigation potential by preserving and repairing the completed water conservation schemes in the state, the Chief Minister's Water Conservation Scheme is being implemented under the relevant Schedule No. 1. K.P. Bandhara Belura Ta.
The Bhokardan-Jalna project was completed in 2016. The landslide occurred due to outflanking of land and arrows on the right side of the river Tira in Bhokardan taluka. Agricultural land on the upper and lower side of the key wall has been damaged. As a result, the farmers have not been able to irrigate their fields for the last couple of months. Hence, the proposal has been put on hold. This scheme is in priority 1 of the Chief Minister's Water Conservation Plan. With the revision of the scheme, the original envisaged water storage is 780 cft and the original irrigation potential is 151 hectare.
Therefore, the matter of giving administrative approval to these repair works was under the consideration of the government.
The government has taken the following steps in this regard:
