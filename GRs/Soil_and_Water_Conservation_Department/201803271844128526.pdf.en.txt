Preamble: Pazar Talav Dodma under Zila Parishad Nagpur, M.A. The mountain As per the decision of the Civil Court in LAC No. 181, 195, 243 and 268/2005 in the land acquisition case of the land acquired for the project Kuhi, the proposal for the demand of funds was submitted to the Government through Reference No. 3 submitted to the government. In fact, the compensation for land acquisition for the projects approved by the Zila Parishads has to be paid by them from their own financial sources.
However, since the government had already provided funds on this project and the Law and Justice Department was of the opinion not to appeal against the order of the Civil Court, the matter of disbursing funds under the head of accounts of the scheme was under the consideration of the government. Since the project has incurred expenditure beyond administrative sanction, it requires revised administrative sanction. However, the government has not yet responded. As per the circular dated 21/02/2018, the remuneration in respect of court cases has been decided to be paid from the available funds every financial year, subject to revised administrative approval. In view of all these aspects, the following decision has been taken on the proposal of the Superintending Engineer, Minor Irrigation (Water Conservation) Board, Nagpur, in accordance with the instructions in the relevant circular of the Finance Department.
Government Decision: Pazar Talab Dodma, Mou.
