The proposal has been submitted to the government. Near the village of Ner, a canal, Mauje Kalsa Ta. The village is located near the Phulwadi river. Drain widening and deepening work near Yavatmal village and Mauje Ghui Taner G. Yavatmal, Mauje Kati Ta. Digras G. Yavatmal, Mauje Kalsa Ta. The construction work is proposed to be carried out for a drain at Yavatmal with UCR masonry pointing. Every year, the river overflows its banks, causing massive flooding in the villages and villages on the banks of the river. Due to the sloping nature of this river/ nullah, the erosion of the river/ nullah has been greatly reduced by accumulating silt. As a result, the discharge capacity of the river has decreased. The heavy rains have caused extensive damage to crops and crops in some areas. For this, the government was considering widening and deepening of the canal on a trial basis. Similarly, a causeway with gates has been proposed so that after the end of the rainy season, water can be blocked from the gate and the farmers can use the causeway to go from one bank of the canal to the other. This deepening will increase the water available by increasing the water storage of the existing dam.
