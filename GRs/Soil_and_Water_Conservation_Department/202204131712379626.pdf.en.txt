They have to obtain water availability certificates and all types of water.
It is also necessary to take the recommendation of the Chief Engineer under Water Resources of the concerned area for the availability certificate. It is experienced that while receiving the water availability certificate from the Chief Engineer Water Resources, there is a delay in submitting each proposal to the concerned Chief Engineer, to correct the error. Chief Engineer Hydrology, Nashik. As on 23.03.2020, for Water Availability Certificate Rs. 7,70,200 per proposal to the Department of Water Resources.
In the absence of water availability certificate, proposals of small schemes of soil and water conservation department are also pending in large numbers. This leads to delay in the implementation of such schemes.
The water availability certificate from soil and water conservation departments is available, however, the schemes are not being implemented or cancelled due to farmer protests, court cases, land acquisition process and other reasons.
In the above case, the schemes of the Department of Soil and Water Conservation which have received water availability certificate for the disposal of such pending schemes, however, since the said scheme is inoperative or being cancelled, the matter was under the consideration of the Government to authorize the Additional Commissioner Water Conservation and the Chief Engineer, Soil and Water Conservation Regional Area to use the sanctioned water for other schemes of the Department of Soil and Water Conservation in the same valley. A circular has been issued in this regard.
Circular:
Keeping in view the nature and scope of minor irrigation schemes under Soil and Water Conservation Department, it is advisable to change the approved scheme site as per Water Availability Certificate at the time of actual scheme implementation. The location of the scheme has to be changed according to the regional situation and demand. In such a situation, the water availability certificate has to be obtained again from the Water Resources Department for the new proposed site-specific scheme. This process takes a lot of time. Due to which time is wasted in completing the schemes under the soil and water conservation department. So this needs to change.
The following action should be taken:
If the scheme which has received water availability certificate from the Water Resources Department has to be cancelled as per the regional situation, then the available and sanctioned water can be used for other newly proposed schemes in the same river basin/ sub-basin.
