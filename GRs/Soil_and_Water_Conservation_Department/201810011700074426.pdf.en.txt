INTRODUCTION: While selecting the dam site for the work of embankment with Kolhapur type/ by, in the district of Vidarbha, the site of the proposed dam in the river basin should have suitable rock (Core Recovery 70%) for foundation. According to the government circular of 1, about 7.50 m. It needs to be in the room. However, in eastern Vidarbha, hard rocks are generally 7.50 m high. It is found in more than one room.
The body wall and pier of the dam are 7.50 m when conceptualized as Kolhapur type/ gate type embankment. If taken to a depth of more than that i.e. to a hard rock, a very large amount of bonding costs and is not feasible. As an alternative solution to this, raft has to be provided on soft ground for the foundation while conceptualizing the CoP dam. It has been observed at the field level that the work done according to the concept proposed by Raft has been well organized and leak-proof.
The Kolhapur type barrage works do not require land acquisition and these works benefit the farmers by creating irrigation potential at a lower cost and in a shorter period of time compared to minor irrigation schemes. Therefore, there is a huge demand for such works from the people's representatives in eastern Vidarbha.
In line with the above, the concept of soft ground was prepared by V.N.I.T. Nagpur and referred to as Reference No. As per Section 2 of the Act, the Chief Engineer, Minor Irrigation (Water Conservation), Pune submitted the proposals to the Central Sankalp Chitra Sangathan, Nashik for vetting. According to section 3," The concept of a CP bond with a soft-bottomed base was not known to V. N.I.T./ WAPCOS or Government recognized technical institute informed to take decision on the concept

Accordingly, the following guidelines should be followed when designing this specific location.
Government circular:
1. Before preparing the budget for the project of the dam, the government decision was taken by the Water Resources Department. Detailed survey should be conducted as per the provisions of 10.08.2011.
Bore holes should be taken as per the provisions as per MI manual at the project site and water intake test for permeability should be conducted. Based on the findings of bore holes and water intake test, the geotechnical report should be certified by a senior geologist. If the strata certified as Impervious/ Semi Impervious, there should be no objection to proposing embankments. However, if the stratified crust is found to be a pervious or sandy layer, then embankments should not be proposed.
3. The Executive Engineer/ District Water Conservation Officer after validating the geological classification as per the report of the Senior Geologist, should prepare the concept of soft bedded embankment by adopting the procedures prescribed by V.N.I.T./ WAPCOS or Government approved technical institutions.
The Chief Engineer, Minor Irrigation (Water Conservation), Pune, the Superintending Engineer and the Regional Water Conservation Officer, Nagpur and the Superintending Engineer and the Regional Water Conservation Officer, Amravati, shall make a detailed study of the above survey, the results of various tests, the geological classification and the contents of the concept in detail and in technical terms. The decision has to be taken collectively.
The appropriate concept should be approved by the competent authorities and only then administrative approval, technical approval and tender proceedings should be carried out.
6. Since the embankments are concrete storage structures, the authorities concerned should ensure that there is no leakage from the foundation of the embankment.
7. While implementing such works, special supervision should be given at the field level to ensure quality and excellence of work. The concerned field officers will be held responsible if any defective quality and standard is found at any level.

8. The said Circular shall be applicable to the districts of East Vidarbha as well as to the specific places mentioned in the Preamble where the height of the 7.50 m is specified. Hard rock falls on the deeper side. It will be applicable for Kolhapur type/ gate type embankments at such places.
The guidelines should be implemented immediately.
