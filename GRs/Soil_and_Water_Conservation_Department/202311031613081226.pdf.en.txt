The proposal was submitted to the government. The right side of the river near the village of Darva G. Yavatmal. The work of widening and deepening of the left side drain of the river near the village of Darva G. Yavatmal is proposed. Every year, the river overflows its banks, causing massive flooding in the villages and villages on the banks of the river. Due to the sloping nature of this river/ nullah, the erosion of the river/ nullah has been greatly reduced by accumulating silt. As a result, the capacity of the river has been reduced.
The heavy rains have caused extensive damage to crops and crops in some areas. Similarly, a causeway with gates has been proposed so that after the end of the rainy season, water can be blocked from the gate and the farmers can use the causeway to go from one bank of the canal to the other. This deepening will help in meeting the objectives of flood protection as well as water conservation by increasing the water storage available in the existing embankment and by adding additional water for recharge.
These works are being taken up on a pilot basis in Arvi, Ashti and Karanja taluks of Wardha district on the lines of works sanctioned under various government decisions. The estimated cost of the work is Rs.
4,97,29, 074/- was under consideration of the Government for grant of administrative approval for the said work.
