Approval is subject to the following conditions.
1.It will be mandatory to fill the water table in time and install a water meter as per the existing government decision.
2. In case of water shortage, a storage tank of minimum 60 days capacity should be constructed at own cost to meet the water requirement of the institution. Also, if water is not available in the scheme during this period, the Soil and Water Conservation Department will have no responsibility.
3. If there is shortage of water at the source, the institution cannot ensure the availability of reserve water.
Generally, the planning of minor irrigation projects is for eight months. Therefore, the water is drained in the summer. (No water at all) Therefore, in exceptional circumstances, water supply schemes are permitted where no other source of water is available. However, it is not guaranteed that such sanctioned water supply scheme will get water in summer. For this, it is necessary to have a stock.
Most water supply schemes take a gestation period to start.
Generally, the organization avoids signing any contract or agreement with the organization during this period.
Even after signing of the non-irrigation agreement, the government is not getting any water.
