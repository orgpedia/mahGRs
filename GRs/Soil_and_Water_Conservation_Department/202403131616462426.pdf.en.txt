Read: 1. Department of Soil and Water Conservation Government Decision Sibanka-2022 / Q. No.212 / Jal 1, D. 17.04.2023 2.

The Proposal -
Mauje Zirpurwadi, Mahagao, Wai, Sevdas Nagar, Malhiwara, Khandapur Ta. Digras G.
The deepening and widening of the Causeway FARINAS drain at Yavatmal is proposed.
The river / rivulet flowing in and around the village in the catchment area is getting heavy floods every year due to which the river is spreading on both sides causing flood water damage to the embankments on the bank as well as the village on the bank of the river. The river / rivulet erosion has been greatly reduced due to the very slow slope of the river / rivulet as well as the accumulation of silt.
This has reduced the discharge capacity of the river / rivulet. Heavy rains have caused extensive damage to the village and agricultural crops, with reports of farm losses in some areas. Similarly, the ENYA Cause Way has been proposed so that after the end of the monsoon season, it will be possible to block the water by opening the gate and the cause way will be used for the shooters to go from one end of the drain to the other. This deepening will help meet the objective of water conservation along with flood protection by augmenting the water storage available from the existing dam to replenish it. These works are proposed on an experimental basis. The estimated cost of the work is Rs. 4,97,94, 315 / - was coming and the government was considering giving administrative approval to the work.
