Preamble: Pazar Talav Dodma under Zila Parishad Nagpur, M.A. Dodma. As per the decision of the Civil Court in LAC No. 142, 143/2006 in the land acquisition case of the land acquired for the project Kuhi, the proposal for the demand of funds is referred to Reference No. 3 submitted to the government. In fact, the compensation for land acquisition for the projects approved by the Zila Parishads has to be paid by them from their own financial sources. However, since the government had already provided funds on this project and the Law and Justice Department was of the opinion not to appeal against the order of the Civil Court, the matter of disbursing funds under the head of accounts of the scheme was under the consideration of the government. Since the project has incurred expenditure beyond administrative sanction, it requires revised administrative sanction. However, the government has not yet responded. As per the circular dated 21/02/2018, the remuneration in respect of court cases has been decided to be paid from the available funds every financial year, subject to revised administrative approval.
Accordingly, on the proposal of the Superintending Engineer, Minor Irrigation (Water Conservation) Board, Nagpur, the following decision has been taken in accordance with the suggestions in the circular of the Finance Department.
Government Decision: Pazar Talab Dodma, Mou. Dodma. Nagpur The amount of increased cost as per the demand statement in the above LAC for land acquisition of this project is Rs. The Government is granting approval for disbursement of funds to the extent of Rs. 17,35,815/- (Rupees Seventeen Lakhs Thirty Five Thousand Eight Hundred and Fifteen only) subject to the following conditions and conditions.
