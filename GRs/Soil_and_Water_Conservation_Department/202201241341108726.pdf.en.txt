2. Letter from the Additional Commissioner Water Conservation and Chief Engineer, Soil and Water Conservation Regional Area, Pune No. P.S. 1/3040, d. 20.10.2021
Introduction: K. P. Bandhara Kirlos, T. The Malvan G. Sindhudurg scheme was physically completed in 2006 and has been collecting water since December 2006. Most of the iron needles installed on the embankment are completely damaged due to corrosion, theft, bending, overflow, etc. The side channels have also been damaged. Therefore, there is no water in the well. Also, the bottom of the bridge is damaged. Also in this plan, the side channel and gate need to be repaired. Strengthening of the slab has also been proposed. It is proposed to store water through FRP gates instead of iron needles. Due to these factors, the FRP gate has been replaced by a corrected iron gate to store water. Therefore, these plans need to be revised. Therefore, the matter of administrative approval of the repair works was under consideration of the government. The government has taken the following steps in this regard:
Government Decision: Co. P. Bandhara Kirlos, Ta. Rs. 2,70,17, 361.00/- (Rupees Two Crores Seventy Lakhs Seventeen Thousand Three Hundred and Sixty-one only), as per the proposal of the Finance Department, Govt. The administrative approval is being granted subject to the following conditions, taking into consideration the notification dated 10th November, 2020:
