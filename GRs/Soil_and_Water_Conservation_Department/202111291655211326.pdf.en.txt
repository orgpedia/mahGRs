The Proposal:
Since the functions of the department are small and scattered, the need to be under the control of a single administrative department was felt in 1992 to successfully implement water conservation schemes aimed at providing permanent solutions to drought-prone situations.
Government General Administration Department No. This work was entrusted to the Department of Rural Development and Water Conservation through a notification ROB 1092/ CR- 10/92/ XVIll (O& M), dated 05th June 1992. It has been almost 39 years since the Water Conservation Department came into existence in the State.
As per the approval of the State Cabinet in its meeting dated 25th April, 2017, and in pursuance of the Government Decision, the Rural Development and Water Conservation Department No. Establishment 2016/ PR No.88 (Part IX)/ Water-II dated 31.05.2017 has created a new Department of Soil and Water Conservation. The target of Soil and Water Conservation Department has been increased from 250 hectares to 600 hectares and construction, maintenance, repair and management of schemes with limited irrigation potential of 0-600 hectares has been fixed. In the meanwhile. 'Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan' was launched on 05/12/2014. The

As the campaign progressed, various aspects were taken into account and to ensure effective implementation of the scheme, a water balance sheet was prepared for each village taking into account the rainfall, topography, strata, crops grown, number of animals available in the village and the population of the village. Based on the balance sheet, an' action plan' was prepared for various treatments to be carried out in each village so that water could be made available for protected irrigation and drinking water to the fields in the outskirts. Adequate funds and manpower were made available to implement the action plan. The villages that successfully implemented the scheme were termed as' Jal Paripoorna Villages'. After planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation, the process was decided to declare the villages as' Jal Paripoorna Gaon'. Follow all these steps. As on 14/02/2020, about 20,544 villages have been declared as' Jal Paripoorna Gaon' in the State.
The campaign, which was implemented for six years, received more than 600 complaints in the state. The Comptroller and Auditor General conducted an in-depth study of the work done by randomly selecting a total of 1128 villages from one district in each division, as well as the planning, implementation, control and evaluation process. Both of these points point to the need for further investigation into the quality of work and the process of implementation. So the. As of December 1, 2020.
The government has formed an investigation committee. Out of a total of 6,30,000 works, 74 per cent were found to be deficient.
Moreover, when the ministers of various departments hold a review meeting on the water conservation of their constituency or district, special suggestions are made to improve the quality of the works of the department.
At some places, it is also said that once SIT has been appointed to investigate the work of this department, such inquiry committees can be appointed again and again.
Since the department is newly formed, it takes action as per the decision of the Government of the Water Resources Department and Public Works Department in the tender process of the works and other matters. However, there is such negative talk about the quality of work of the Soil and Water Conservation Department. There is not as much dissatisfaction with the work of the other two departments by implementing the same government decision. When the reasons are analyzed, it is said that the work of this department is small and scattered and due to insufficient filling up of the posts of junior and deputy engineer in the department, adequate inspection cannot be done.
At present, the annual budget of the department is Rs. 3,000 crore and will continue to grow.
The department is in the process of filling up various posts. From the experience of other departments, it is clear that usually 70 to 80 percent of the posts are filled. In the coming time, this sector will also reach that level. However, it is not expected that enough officers will be available for inspection to satisfy the officials of the department. Therefore, there is a need to work on quality sensitivity and awareness.
