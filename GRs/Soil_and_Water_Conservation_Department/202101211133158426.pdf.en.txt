Introduction Irrigation Lake Visroli, Ta. Chandur Bazar, G. Amravati was completed in 1977-78. As per the observation given by the Executive Engineer of the scheme and District Water Conservation Officer, Amravati, the construction of the irrigation tank Visroli is 42 years old. The irrigation capacity of the lake is 100. In 2003, a large hole was created by pressing soil into the main release chain of the dam wall. At that time, the pit was temporarily repaired. But this part of the chain gets submerged every year in the rainy season. Therefore, water is being released from the main reservoir to prevent the water level from rising and threatening the wall of the lake. In 2007 and 2010, due to heavy rains, a large amount of water flowed through the sewerage, which led to a 10 m drop in the sewerage from Sandwa Bar to D/ S. There is a huge pothole in the distance. The depth of the hole is 9.0 m. That's so much. No permanent repairs have been made to the dam since its construction. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out a complete repair of the pond from the point of view of its safety and to provide water for irrigation to the farmers. The project will irrigate an area of 100 hectares and the proposed water storage capacity is 625 cusecs. Therefore, the matter of administrative approval of the repair works was under consideration of the government. The government has taken the following steps in this regard:
