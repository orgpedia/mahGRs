Read: 1. Department of Soil and Water Conservation Government Decision Sibanka-2022 / Q. No.212 / Jal 1, D. 17.04.2023 2. Additional Commissioner Water Conservation and Chief Engineer, Soil and Water Conservation Regional Area, Nagpur No. PRASA - 2/266 Yavatmal Division, 2023 / Amravati Division / Budget / D. 05.02.2024
The Proposal -
Mauje Devnala, Ajni, Jodamoha Ta. Nallah deepening and widening work is proposed with Causeway Dam at Kalamb District Yavatmal. The river / rivulet flowing in and around the villages in the catchment area is getting major floods every year due to which the river is spreading on both sides causing flood water damage to the fields on the banks as well as the villages on the banks of the river. The river / rivulet erosion has been greatly reduced due to the very slow slope of the river / rivulet as well as the accumulation of silt. This has reduced the discharge capacity of the river / rivulet. Heavy rains have caused extensive damage to the village and agricultural crops, with reports of farm losses in some areas. Similarly, a causeway with gates has been proposed so that after the end of the monsoon season, it will be possible to block the water by opening the gate and farmers will use the causeway to go from one end of the drain to the other. This deepening will help meet the objective of water conservation along with flood protection by augmenting the water storage available from the existing dam to replenish it. These works are proposed on an experimental basis.
The estimated cost of the work is Rs. 4,94,72, 382 / - and the Government was considering granting administrative sanction for the work.
Governing Decisions: Mauje Devnala, Ajni, Jodamoha Ta. The total cost of the canal deepening and widening works including the Yavatmal Yethil Causeway Dam in Kalamb District is Rs. 4,94,72, 382 / - (Rs. Four Crore ARM Lakh Seventy Two Thousand Three Hundred and Eighty Two only)
