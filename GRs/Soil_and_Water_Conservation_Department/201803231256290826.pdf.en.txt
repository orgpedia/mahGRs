The Proposal:
Soil and water conservation works take a lot of time as the site of the treatment has to be identified, surveyed, administrative and technical approval of the works taken, followed by tendering process and the actual works have to be done. Due to this, under the Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan and other places besides the Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan, soil and water conservation treatment works are being carried out. The extension of the tender period was under the consideration of the government in order to complete the compartment bunding, CCT, gabion embankment, cement embankment, repair works and other related works within the stipulated time.
