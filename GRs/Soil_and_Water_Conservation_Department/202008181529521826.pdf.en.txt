The government has issued a notification for the creation of this new department. The contours of this Department and the field machinery of the Department have been decided by the Government Order dated 31.05.2017.
As per the new format in the said Government decision, the posts of Divisional Accountant in the office of the former Executive Engineer at the district level have been abolished and in lieu of this, the posts of Accounts Officer Class-II (Gazetted) in the cadre of Maharashtra Finance and Accounts Service have been approved for accounting work in the office of the District Water Conservation Officer. In the Commissionerate of Soil and Water Conservation, the posts of Joint Director (Financial Services), Deputy Commissioner Finance, Accounts Officer, Assistant Accounts Officer for the Finance and Accounts Department have been created and filled through the Finance Department. Accordingly, the Finance Department has given postings to the officers in the concerned places to fill up the posts in the office of the District Water Conservation Officer and the Commissionerate under the Department and the process of giving postings is underway. As per 3.2.1 (b), there was earlier a provision to appoint a Divisional Accountant in each Divisional Office through the Office of the Accountant General to take account and collate the accounts of the department and submit the accounts of the department to the Office of the Accountant General through them. However, as per the Government decision dated 31.05.2017 of the Department, the posts of Accounts Officer, Class-II (Gazetted) in the cadre of Maharashtra Finance and Accounts Service have been created instead of the post of Divisional Accountant in the office of District Water Conservation Officer under this Department.
