NO. 23/ OFFICE. 6 Dated 15-03-2018 Preamble: Maharashtra Water Conservation Corporation, Aurangabad has very little funds available in every financial year within the limits of total projects sanctioned. Therefore, the Maharashtra Water Conservation Corporation has reduced the liability of the corporation by cancelling the approval of the projects for which work has not started. Even after this, due to lack of funds, recommendations are being made to the Tribal Development Department for the availability of funds from the Water Conservation Corporation to get funds from the Tribal Sub-Plan for projects undertaken in the tribal areas. Since the projects for which the Tribal Development Department is willing to take responsibility must be transferred to the Tribal Applications, the proposal on Reference 2 and 3 is being decided as follows.
GOVERNMENT DECISION: The Minor Irrigation Scheme, Boripada (Goaldari), Taluka, Maharashtra has been administratively approved by the Maharashtra Water Conservation Corporation, Aurangabad vide order dated 28/03/2013. It is hereby approved to transfer the project at Trimbakeshwar, G.
