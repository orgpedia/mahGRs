The Proposal:
In the general area of the state, large-scale land erosion, rainwater harvesting, and lack of adequate storage facilities are being implemented in the state under various state-sponsored schemes such as watershed-based water conservation and soil conservation. At present, various watershed-based soil and water conservation treatment works are being carried out in the state under schemes like Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan 2.0, Centrally Sponsored Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana- Watershed Development Component 2.0, Kinetic Watershed Development Programme, Chain Cement Dams Programme, Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY), Magel Tu Khettal, etc.

2. Subject to Government Decision. As of 11 April 2008, the technical and financial parameters of some of the soil and water conservation treatments under watershed development have been approved for mechanization. Considering the increase in the price of fuel for the machine, the government took a decision in this regard. As on 01.06.2012, 05.03.2013 and 15.10.2013, the economic parameters of various treatments were enhanced.
3. In the present situation, the prevailing economic parameters such as high wage rates, rising fuel prices, machine prices, flood in machine repair and maintenance costs and inflation, which has become the MHA, are falling short of the permissible economic parameters. As a result, the government was considering revising the economic parameters for mechanised execution of various watershed development works to be undertaken with funds under the Mrid B water conservation schemes.
The government's decision:
The government has taken a decision. As on 07.02.2012, a Committee under the Chairmanship of Commissioner Agriculture, Maharashtra State, Pune has been constituted for determining the technical and economic parameters of soil and water conservation treatment under various schemes of watershed development. The Committee met on 15th February, 2024 and in these meetings, the Committee recommended to the Government to revise the economic parameters as per the Common Rate Index of the Department of Soil Water Conservation (ID1) by maintaining the approved technical parameters of Soil Water Conservation Treatment and this recommendation has been proposed to the Government by the Director, Soil Conservation Watershed Management, Agriculture Commissionerate, Pune. After studying these recommendations, the government is taking the following decisions.
2. Government approves modification of financial parameters as indicated in the accompanying "Statement-A" for mechanization of the following treatment works of watershed based soil and water conservation:
is being provided.
(i) Graded bunding (ii) Compartment bunding (iii) Paddy trench bunding (iv) Farms (with / without silt trap digging) (v) Mud drain dam (v) Continuous level trench (vi) Deep level trench (viii) Cattle control trench (viii) Body repair / renovation (viii)
3. Subject to Government Decision for the above works. July 16, 2007, d. September 28, 2007 and d. The technical parameters set as on 23rd April, 2010 shall continue to be the same. No matter which method the soil and water conservation works indicated in the accompanying "Statement-A" are carried out, the economic parameters prescribed for the completion of the works by machines will remain admissible.
