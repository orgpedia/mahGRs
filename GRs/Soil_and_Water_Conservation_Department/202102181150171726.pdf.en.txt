2. Letter No. PRASA- 1/547 D 09-02-2021 of the Additional Commissioner Water Conservation and Chief Engineer, Soil and Water Conservation Department Regional Area, Pune.
Introduction: Under the Water Conservation Department, land acquisition is required for various works such as minor irrigation tanks, storage tanks, Pazar tanks, Upasana irrigation schemes. However, it has been observed from the implementation of the schemes so far that due to lack of funds or delay in land acquisition process, it is not possible to complete all the land acquisition processes before tendering the project/ taking up the works. This is delaying the project. The cost of the project is also increasing. There is a constant demand from the people's representatives to start water conservation projects immediately, considering this, the land acquisition process, tender process and the work to be undertaken simultaneously will also speed up the land acquisition. Also, considering the fact that the progress of the work can be maintained, if the policy on land acquisition of the schemes is decided at the government level, the land acquisition and actual implementation of the projects will be expedited.
Schemes of Soil and Water Conservation Department are less extensive and scattered in nature as compared to Water Resources Department, which generally take 2 to 3 years to complete. In the implementation of earlier schemes, it has been observed that administrative approval, technical approval and tendering process of the schemes along with land acquisition process in parallel, speed up the work of the scheme. During the last year, due to the outbreak of Corona, the work of the schemes could not be taken up due to the code of conduct of various elections.
There are strong demands of the local people's representatives and farmers to take up and complete these schemes, considering this, the government is issuing a circular to complete the land acquisition process in parallel with the work of the scheme in accordance with the schemes under the Soil and Water Conservation Department.
