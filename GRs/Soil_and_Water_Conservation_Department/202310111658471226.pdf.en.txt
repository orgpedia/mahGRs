The Proposal:
The metamorphic rock is found in Bhandara, Gondia, Chandrapur and Gadchiroli districts of eastern Vidarbha, the eastern part of Nagpur district and parts of Yavatmal district in Nanded and Amravati divisions of Marathwada. The characteristics of the soil are that no matter how much rain falls, very little water remains in the soil.

Therefore, in order to provide sustainable irrigation, a large number of ponds were built in Vidarbha keeping in mind the need to store rainwater in the ponds.
Paddy is the main crop grown in the Vidarbha region. The average rainfall is during the four months of June to September. But often when the rice crop needs more water, at the same time, there is often a big break in the irregular rainfall and there is a big impact on the rice production. Therefore, with a view to providing protected irrigation by overcoming the rain block, about 6700 ponds with an irrigation capacity of 31,900 hectares were constructed in this area during the period of Gond kings about 300 years ago. During the British period these lakes were owned by the Malgujars. In 1950, the government took over the lake from the Malguzas, and since then the lake has been referred to as the former Malguzas Lake.
Lakes with irrigation potential of 0 to 100 hectares have been transferred to the District Council and those with irrigation potential of more than 100 hectares to the Water Conservation and Water Resources Department.
The list of the beneficiaries of the distribution rights who have access to irrigation facilities from these former Malguzari tanks is available in the distribution letter and this document is available in the Talathi office. The water of the lake is used for irrigation of paddy crops in the kharif season. The right of disposal is with the holders as per the order of the Supreme Court.
The Government of Maharashtra, Rural Development and Water Conservation Department, Government Decision No. Mamat 2011/ Q.No.344/ Jal-3, dated 03.11.2011 vide Adv. The committee was headed by Madhukar Rao. The committee submitted its report to the government in 2012. According to the report, most of the former Malguzari lakes, which are currently under the management of the Zilla Parishad, are in a dilapidated condition and the lakes have been damaged and it was recommended to undertake special repair and rejuvenation work.
The Vidarbha Irrigation Development Corporation has already taken up the programme of renovation of 128 former Malgujari tanks having irrigation potential of more than 100 hectares. The government has issued reference No. The campaign was undertaken by the government decision of 8. Accordingly, 1833 former Malguzari lakes have been revived. Department of Soil and Water Conservation, Govt. Mamat-2016/ PR No. 123/ JAL-1, dated 16/05/2016 was under the consideration of the Government to issue guidelines regarding the revival and repair of the former Malguzari Lakes in the State. Accordingly, the government has taken the following decisions:

Government Resolution No: SANKIRN-2023/ PR No. 516/ JAL-1
Government Decision: Suggestions regarding the revival and repair of the former Malgujari lakes in the state: 1) The cost of the former Malgujari lake treatment to be revived and repaired is fixed by the Water Resources Department for minor irrigation lakes. 20% of the prevailing monetary standards as per norms 2017/ (452/ 2017)/ LPA-2, Ministry of Finance, Mumbai-400 032, dated 13th July, 2018 shall continue to apply.
2) The revival and repair works of the former Malguzari lakes under the jurisdiction of the Zilla Parishad and the State level should be taken up by that body as the implementing mechanism.
3) Administrative approval for the works of rejuvenation and repair of the former Malgujari Lake will be provided from the government level.
4. Proposal for Rejuvenation and Repair of Former Malgujari Lake: i. Repairing of earth work, remover, mould etc.
(ii) Desilting and deepening of ponds.
iii. To take ponds of maximum half hectare area and 2 to 3 meter depth in the submerged area of the pond as per the advice of the Fisheries Department.
The following terms and conditions shall apply to the said administrative approval: 1. The lakes which have undergone repair for 10 years or more shall be eligible for repair. The District Water Conservation Officer of the Zilla Parishad and the State Level Soil and Water Conservation Department should prepare a report by issuing comments mentioning the proposed rejuvenation and repair in the joint inspection note. However, in order to reduce the period of 10 years due to natural calamities, the Regional Water Conservation Officer should visit the actual work site and prepare a report by issuing a note mentioning the proposed rejuvenation and repairs in the inspection note.
Before commissioning of the work, the budget/ project should be certified by the competent technical officer and its photograph/ GIS based photographs should be taken.
Government Resolution No. 3: Gamudha-2023/ No. 22/ Jal-13, D. Sludge Free Dams and Sludge Free Sewers Scheme has been implemented in the State as per 20-04-2023. The government should take this decision into consideration.
4. Before starting the repair work, at all stages of the work, during the work and after completion, the said work should be inspected by the Regional Vigilance and Quality Control Team. Thereafter, the Regional Monitoring and Quality Control Team

Final payments for repair works should be made after receiving the certificate of satisfactory repair work.
5. Follow the extant instructions of the Finance and Planning Departments. However, the funds will be distributed by the government to the concerned Regional Water Conservation Officer. These funds should be distributed to the irrigation works for repair by the District Council and the District Water Conservation Officer (State Level) system.
6) The tender process should be adopted as per the e-tendering policy of the government.
Besides rejuvenation of these ponds, the responsibility of maintenance and repair of these ponds at the village level should be entrusted to the Village Disposal Rights Committee and for this purpose they should be suitably enlightened and empowered.
Step-by-step financial planning of lakes suitable for rejuvenation of former Malguzari lakes. The rejuvenation of these lakes should be planned on the basis of project-based planning.
9. After rejuvenation of these tanks, these tanks should be transferred for further maintenance by forming a" Disposal Right Water Utilization Society." However, if it is not possible to create a" Disposal Right" Water Utilization Society on a pond, the pond should be transferred to the Gram Panchayat of the village with the consent of the Disposal Right holders.
10. The revival of these tanks should be planned in such a way that the former Malguzari tanks constructed for the purpose of protected irrigation for paddy crops can be used for double cropping, especially by creating additional irrigation potential for rabi crops, vegetable and fruit crops.
The funds received for restoration of these ponds will be handed over to the concerned Regional Water Conservation Officer, Soil and Water Conservation Department. However, the authority to make inter-district reallocation of the fund after reviewing the system-wise available funds and the expenditure incurred will be vested with the Additional Commissioner Water Conservation and the Chief Engineer, Soil and Water Conservation.
12. Cost of treatment of former Malguzari Lake to be repaired for Minor Irrigation Lakes. The aggregate should be limited to 20% of the prevailing fiscal standards as per norms 2017/ (452/2017)/ LPA-2, Ministry of Finance, Mumbai-400 032, dated 13th July, 2018. Further, if the cost of construction/ treatment to be repaired is more than 20% of the prevailing financial parameters for minor irrigation tanks, the Regional Water Conservation Officer concerned will be required to inspect the site and ascertain the nature of work before submitting administrative sanction proposals for such works.

The jurisdiction of Soil and Water Conservation Department has been increased from 250 hectares to 600 hectares. The expenditure for the repair of the former Malguzari lakes under the control of the Zila Parishad, State Level, within the limits of the irrigation capacity, should be made under the head of demand ZH-5, 4702 Small Irrigation Schemes, 4702A073 (2) (4) Reconstruction and Strengthening of Old Malguzari Lakes (Programme), 53, Large Constructions.
The government's orders should be strictly followed.
