Varsha Multipurpose Mahila Prasarak Mandal, Bhandara for the academic year 2022-23. Petition No. 4086/2022 has been filed in the High Court, Bench Nagpur. In this case, the court The High Court has passed the following orders dated 07.06.2023.
As the situation stands today, there does not appear to be any discrepancy in the proposals, which are rejected and which proposals are recommended by the University. The petitioner did cure the lacunae, if any, by submitting the completion certificate of the buildings on 13/06/2022. In this view of the matter, we find no justification in the stand of the State Government that the proposals submitted by the petitioner-institution cannot be approved, particularly since even according to the affidavit in response filed on behalf of the State, the proposals now do satisfy the conditions prescribed in Appendix-B to the Government Resolution dated 12/10/2017.
We, therefore, quash and set aside the impugned communication dated 29/06/2022 and direct respondent 1 to issue / grant approval to the proposals submitted by the petitioner-institution for starting new colleges in the Bhandara District with effect from next academic year.
The petition is allowed in the aforesaid terms. Rule is made absolute with no order as to costs.
In pursuance of the order dated 07.06.2023 passed by the Hon'ble High Court, the Statement' A' attached to the new colleges of the petitioner institution
