The proposal:
The Finance Department 01.04.2010 and D. As per the Government decision dated 05.07.2010, the Scheme of Assured Progress under Services, which was earlier applicable to State Government employees and employees of Zila Parishads in lone posts and who have the opportunity for promotion respectively, has been revised and renamed as Assured Progress under Improved Services Scheme. The Sixth Pay Commission was implemented with effect from 01.10.2006.
2) The Finance Department. 01.04.2010 and D. The provisions of the Government Decision dated 05.07.2010 are as follows: 15.02.2011 and D. As on 28.12.2010, the same has been made applicable to non-agricultural universities and affiliated colleges. As per the decision of the government, eligible employees of non-agricultural universities and affiliated colleges under the Directorate of Higher Education have taken advantage of this scheme. However, the government decided against it. 15.02.2011 and D. The approval of the Finance Department was not taken prior to issue on 28.12.2010. The decision was taken by the Finance Ministry. 01.04.2010 and D. The Finance Department directed to cancel the Government decisions issued without the consent of the Finance Department with retrospective effect as the Assured Progress Scheme under the revised services implemented under 05.07.2010 is applicable only to the State Government employees and the employees of the Zilla Parishad. The government has taken the decision. 15.02.2011 and D. 28.12.2010 respectively. 07.12.2018 and D. The Government Decision dated 16.02.2019 is hereby revoked with retrospective effect.
(3) The decision of the Government. 07.12.2018 and D. Against 16.02.2019. The High Court, Bench at Aurangabad filed Writ Petition No. 5363/2021 (Sh. Meghraj Pandit and others v. Government of Maharashtra

Government Resolution No: Parichay-2016/ P.No. 262/16/ Vishy-1
and others) and 39 other cases. The High Court. Final Order passed on 20.01.2022. The operative part of this final order is as follows:
The petitioners are entitled to presume that the procedure prescribed in the Rules of Business have been properly observed and adhered to. The internal requirements of adhering to the rules of business have been fully complied with. There is no reason for the petitioners who have been accommodated the benefit under the Government Resolution expressed in the name of the Governor to suspect about non adherence to the Rules of Business and/ or that the concurrence of the Finance Department before issuance of the Government Resolution was not obtained. The petitioners would be alien to the internal working of the department of the government. The only exception to the doctrine of indoor management is fraud or the suspicion of irregularity. The Apex Court in a case of M.R.F. Ltd. v. Manohar Parrikar and Ors. Reported in 2010 (11) SCC 374 has observed that protection of doctrine of indoor management is not available where the circumstances surrounding are suspicious and therefore invite enquiry. In the present case, the Government Resolution extending the benefit of Pragati Yojana to the petitioners is expressed in the name of the Governor. The said benefit was already accorded to the Government employees under earlier Government Resolution dated 01.04.2010 and similarly the petitioners were extended the said benefit. The prelude to the Government Resolutions dated 28.12.2010 and 15.02.2011 also affirm that it was under contention of the Government to extend the benefit accorded to the Government employees as per the Government Resolution dated 01.04.2010 issued by the Finance Department to the non-teaching employees of the non-agricultural Universities and affiliated colleges to the non-agricultural Universities and pursuant thereto the decision was taken to extend the said benefit" as it is" to the non-teaching employees of the non-agricultural Universities and affiliated colleges to the non-agricultural Universities under the Government Resolutions dated 15.02.2011 and 28.02.2010 In view of that, it would be too late in the day now to take away the benefits already accorded to these petitioners by applying the impugned Government Resolutions retrospectively. The same would also be inequitable.
....22) In the light of that, though we uphold the impugned Government Resolutions revoking the earlier Government Resolutions dated 28.12.2010 and 15.02.2011, we hold that the said impugned Government Resolutions would apply from the date of issuance of the Government Resolutions and not prior to it. We would read down the impugned Government Resolutions in a manner that they would apply from the date they are issued viz. from 07.12.2018 and 16.02.2019 respectively and would not apply to those who have already been accorded the benefits as per the Government Resolutions dated 28.12.2010 and 15.02.2011.
8. as well. The Nagpur Bench of the High Court has reserved its order on the petition. In 2894/2021
The following orders have been passed on 10.02.2022:
Accordingly, while partly allowing the petition, we uphold the validity of the impugned Government Resolutions and hold that these GR's would apply from their respective dates of issuance which are 7.12.2018 and 16.02.2019 respectively, and they would not apply to those who have already been accorded the benefits as per the Government Resolutions dated 28.12.2010 and 15.02.2011.

ii) The respondents Nos. 3, 4 and 5 shall consider the entitlement of the petitioners for grant of benefit of pay revision as per recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission
5. also. The High Court of Bombay, vide Petition No. 3033/2020 and other petitions. Based on the court's order. Orders passed on 11.04.2022 are as follows:
We therefore partly allow the petition and uphold the validity of the impugned Government Resolution and hold that these Government Resolutions would apply from their respective dates of issuance i.e. 7/12/2018 and 16.02.2019 respectively and that they would not apply to those who have already been accorded the benefits as per Government Resolution dated 28/12/2010 and 15.02.2011.
