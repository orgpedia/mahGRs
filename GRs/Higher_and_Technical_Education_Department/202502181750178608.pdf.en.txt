03. Ma. High Court Writ Petition No. 2492/2024 (Petitioner Mr. Nishant Gatkal)
The functional parts of the order passed in the case dated 23rd October, 2024 are as follows:
It is: -
"5. Time and again, we have cautioned the State Authorities not to entertain the applications filed by social workers or bystanders or persons unconnected with the organization and who have not suffered any personal legal injury.
6. In several cases, we have noticed that the persons describing themselves as social workers, lodge complaints against teachers and professors working in schools, Colleges and Universities and hold out threats to the education department to compel them to commence roving inquiries against such employees. We have directed that such complaints should not be entertained. In some matters, we have also held that, Writ Petitions filed by such persons who intend to settle a personal score or pray for roving inquiries, should not be entertained.
7. The learned Senior Advocate appearing for the Petitioners submits that Respondent No. 5 herein, has lodged several complaints against the Petitioner Institution and has also started filing RTI applications seeking personal information about the employees and the management of the Institution, though he is completely unknown and unconnected with the institution.
8. Respondent No. 6 - Dr.Bhausaheb B. Chavan, who is the Deputy Director of Education, Nashik, has tendered an affidavit in reply from page 101, along with several documents, upto page 155. He has tendered an apology and has categorically stated that the impugned orders and the impugned notices issued by him, stand withdrawn, forthwith. He further submits that after noticing several orders passed by this Court, which have been referred to herein above, he has stopped entertaining the complaints filed by strangers or bystanders and would not entertain such complaints anytime in future.
9. We were contemplating suo moto action against Respondent No.6, since we find that though he was aware of our earlier orders referred to in the above paragraphs, for reasons best known to him, he has wholeheartedly entertained the applications of Respondent No. 5 and has highhandedly issued an order to register an FIR against one senior member of the Management.
10. Respondent No.5 appears to be habituated to holding out threats of self immolation, before various Deputy Directors of Education. Some of such complaints are placed before us by Respondent No.6, along with his affidavit in reply. These threats are aimed at terrorising the Government Officials. In view of such circumstances, we permit Respondent No.6 to lodge police complaints against Respondent No.5, whenever he holds out a threat of self-immolation or any such precipitative action or threat of fasting, etc., more so, in the light of the judgment delivered by this Court [Coram: Abhay S Oka (as His Lordship then was) and
