the prelude
The culture of establishing multidisciplinary higher education institutions based on innovation, research and development is growing rapidly at the international level. As most of the higher education institutions in India are single-discipline, there is a lack of multidisciplinary teaching-learning in these institutions, therefore, the National Education Policy-2020 aims to take the Indian higher education system to greater heights by providing new opportunities for innovative teaching and research by establishing multidisciplinary higher education institutions instead of a single-discipline educational institution or grouping several higher education institutions. Such single faculty higher educational institutions and multidisciplinary institutions can come together to provide innovative inter-disciplinary courses of training to enhance the learning capabilities of the student and address emerging challenges. The University Grants Commission (UGC) has issued guidelines for Transforming Higher Education Institutions into Multi-Disciplinary Institutions in September, 2022. The concept of Cluster of Colleges scheme has been elaborated in 03. This scheme is very important from the point of view of effective implementation of National Education Policy-2020.
The state has a large number of single faculty and multidisciplinary higher educational institutions in rural, urban and metropolitan areas. Conversion/ formation of such higher educational institutions into cluster colleges will benefit all the stakeholders and add to the pace of development of higher education in the State.
