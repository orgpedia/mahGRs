GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: RASEYO-2020/ P.No. 58/20/ SASHI-7
However, since these students are under self-employed units, they will not receive any kind of grant from the Central Government or the State Government. In this regard, the Government of the State should take recourse to the Government Resolution No: Sanyukt-2010/ (132/2010)/ Sashi-7, Mantralaya, Mumbai-400032, dated 9th December, 2010. The universities are to allocate grants at their level from the fees collected by the universities for this number of students. (There will be no subsidy from the state or central government.) The universities should submit separate accounts of self-sustaining units to the government by the end of the year.
Universities/ Institutions shall not admit more students than the sanctioned strength of the above mentioned Universities/ Institutions. The number of students for the academic year 2020-21 will also be decided.
Every university/ institution shall send a copy of the number of students allotted to them to the Government by making category wise allocation to all the colleges affiliated to them. The number of students actually enrolled by the universities should be intimated by 31st October, 2020.
