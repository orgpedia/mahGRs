In order to provide better educational facilities to the children of grandmothers/ ex-servicemen in the state of Maharashtra, 5 percent of the admission capacity and a maximum of 5 seats are reserved for the children of grandmothers/ ex-servicemen for admission to diploma and undergraduate professional courses under the Department of Higher and Technical Education.
