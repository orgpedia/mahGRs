The proposal:
For students belonging to Economically Backward Classes under Higher and Technical Education Department
Rajarshi Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj Education Fee Scholarship Scheme.
From applying for the benefit of eligible students under the' Punjabrao Deshmukh Subsistence Allowance Scheme' to depositing the amount directly into the bank accounts of the beneficiaries, all the procedures have to be done on the state-level MahaDBT portal developed by the Directorate of Information and Technology. The academic year 2017 has been made compulsory from 18th as per the Government decision dated 15.04.2017.
However, since the online process of providing the benefits to be paid to the students after registering their application on the said MahaDBT portal is in progress through MahaDBT, the same will be paid to the students.
Eligible students were facing difficulties in getting benefits under the scheme. Therefore, the Rajarshi Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj Tuition Fee Scholarship Scheme under the Directorate of Technical Education under the Department of Higher and Technical Education and Dr. Punjabrao Deshmukh Niveshan Allowance Scheme and other scholarship schemes under the Directorate of Higher Education have been implemented for the academic year 2017-18 by excluding them from the MahaDBT system as per the earlier system, provided the benefit of the scheme is credited directly to the Aadhaar linked bank account of the student.
