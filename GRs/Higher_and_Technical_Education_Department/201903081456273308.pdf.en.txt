The Research score for research papers would be augmented as follows:
Peer-Reviewed or UGC-listed Journals (Impact factor to be determined as per Thomson Reuters list):
i) Paper in refereed journals without impact factor 5 Points
ii) Paper with impact factor less than 1 10 Points
iii) Paper with impact factor between 1 and 2 15 Points
iv) Paper with impact factor between 2 and 5 20 Points
v) Paper with impact factor between 5 and 10 25 Points
vi) Paper with impact factor >10 30 Points
a) Two authors: 70% of total value of publication for each author.
b) More than two authors: 70% of total value of publication for the
First/Principal/Corresponding author and 30% of total value of publication for each of
the joint authors.
Joint Projects: Principal Investigator and Co-investigator would get 50% each.
Note:
Paper presented if part of edited book or proceeding then it can be claimed only once.
For joint supervision of research students, the formula shall be 70% of the total score for
Supervisor and Co-supervisor. Supervisor and Co-supervisor, both shall get 7 marks each.
*For the purpose of calculating research score of the teacher, the combined research score
from the categories of 5(b). Policy Document and 6. Invited lectures/Resource Person/Paper
presentation shall have an upper capping of thirty percent of the total research score of the
teacher concerned.
The research score shall be from the minimum of three categories out of six categories.
