Complaints are being received from various teachers' organizations at the state level about the large number of pending cases of the In-Service Progress Scheme (CAS) of teachers in the state.
The government also issued a notification. In view of the provision regarding date of promotion as on 10.05.2019, the CAS cases of teachers are required to be disposed of without delay after holding qualification and eligibility.
7.3 (vi) of the Government Preamble. In view of the provision mentioned in clause (i), the teachers are required to be promoted by completing the process of promotion on the date they fulfill the eligibility and qualification of the In-Service Advancement Scheme (CAS). Also, the date of completion of the teacher qualification and qualification is regularly reviewed by the universities and the Joint Director's Office and the government decides for CAS. As per the provision of 08.03.2019, the CAS process needs to be completed by forming a committee. Keeping in view the delay in the promotion of teachers so that the teachers do not suffer, a schedule should be fixed for CAS or a meeting should be held for CAS on a particular day, preferably in the last week of every month. As CAS meets every month, the number of cases will also be limited and there will be no pendency of cases.
