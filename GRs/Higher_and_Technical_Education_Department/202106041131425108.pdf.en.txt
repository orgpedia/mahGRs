Government circular:
Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj is the best example of how to govern the interests of the people. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was the first king in the history of India who gave orders not to pay attention to the vegetable stalks of the farmers. He fought many battles with the oppressive rulers, both foreign and private, and fought many battles with the landlords and created Swarajya in this land of Maharashtra. To end the tyrannical rule, eighteen brave men of all castes and religions, the mavels of Jivabhava gathered together and fought this battle. He set an example for the people on how to govern. Many ordinances were passed for the people and farmers of our state.
Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj had created a state-run bank in Marathi language. In this text, Sanskrit words are given for the reference of Persian words. Through this book, Maharaj tried to Marathiize the transaction.
Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj is not only the king of Maharashtra but also the king of Gujarat. An important day in the welfare of the people, the great nation-builder's Swarajya, is 6th June, 1674 i. e." Shivrajyabhishek Day." On this day, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was crowned as Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. On the same day, the sovereignty of Swaraj was declared from the royal palace of Raigad. It is on this day that Shri Shivarajyabhisheka Shakya was created and became Maharaj Shaktikarte, which is an auspicious day. On this day, the auspicious festival of Lord Shiva begins.
The coronation day of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj is a day of inspiration for Swaraj, sovereignty and independence. There is a demand from various quarters to celebrate this day as' Shivswarajya Day."
