The petitioner in his affidavit filed under Rule 7 of the Bombay High Court Public Interest Litigation Rules, 2010 given an undertaking to pay cost as shall be ordered by this court, if it is ultimately held that the petition is frivolous or has been filed for extraneous consideration and lacks bonafide. We fail to understand as to how the department is concerned with the benefits granted to the teachers working under the colleges/ institutions run by the education department of the state government. The mujahideen claims to be an active social worker and we are not satisfied about the bonafides of the mujahideen. Apart from the fact that the Public Interest Litigation cannot be entertained in service matters. We, therefore, dismiss this petition. "
