Read:- Library Directorate Letter No. 32/2023-24/ 2696, dated 27/06/2023.
The Government of Maharashtra recognizing the importance of public libraries has passed the" Maharashtra Public Libraries Act, 1967." The Maharashtra Public Libraries (Subsidiary Grants and Sanctions for Building and Equipment) Rules, 1970 have been framed in accordance with the provisions of the said Act.
At present, grant-in-aid is disbursed to the government-recognised public libraries in the state through the offices of the District Library Officers under the Directorate of Libraries.
This subsidy distribution system needs to be computerized to make it more accessible, effective, transparent and dynamic over time. As a step towards e-governance, the government was considering to process the grant-in-aid of government-recognized public libraries through the Library Grant Management System and deposit the grant of libraries directly from the Directorate of Libraries through the bank accounts of libraries through ECS.
Government Decision: Preservation grant is given annually to the government approved public libraries in the state.
The grant is distributed by the government from the library director and the library director to the district library officer. There exists a mechanism for disbursement of grants to public libraries in the district by the respective District Library Officer offices. The Government has decided to provide grants to Government recognized Public Libraries through Library Grant Management System (LGMS) from 2023-24.
(2) The general procedure in respect of the system shall be as follows: (1) The Library Number of a Government recognized Public Library shall be the User ID of that Library. The link, password and OTP of the system will be sent to the official e-mail and mobile number of the respective libraries by the library management. The libraries concerned will login and upload the documents wherever required by filling in the information in the Annual Report and all the information in the Audit Report for that year. It will be the responsibility of the concerned public library to carry out these proceedings within the time given by the Directorate of Libraries.
(2) The Directorate of Libraries shall issue detailed instructions to all the Assistant Library Directors/ District Library Officers regarding the functioning of the system.
