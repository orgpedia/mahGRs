they are spending. A university is funded by the public, either through the government or through other sources. Such funds are expected to be utilised as per the norms prescribed by the government.

Also, the possibility of the university administration purchasing such vehicles in the future cannot be ruled out.
Therefore, the Finance Department has decided to purchase vehicles for the universities. Considering the provisions of the Government Decision dated 28.07.2020, the matter of formulating a uniform policy was under consideration of the Government.
