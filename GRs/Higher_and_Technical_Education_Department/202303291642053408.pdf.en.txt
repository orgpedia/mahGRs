The proposal:
Department of Science Technology (DST), Government of India has launched an umbrella programme for development of ideas and innovations (knowledge-based and technology-driven)" NIDHI (National Initiative for Development and Harnessing Innovations)" in the year 2016. This includes Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute, Mumbai, an autonomous institute of the state government. Accordingly, in pursuance of the Government decision dated 25.10.2018, it has been approved to set up VJTI Technology Business Incubator (VJTI-TBI) Trust on Not for Profit basis for the funds received from the Central Government for setting up of Incubation Centre in Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute, Mumbai.
The Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute, Mumbai, has received a grant of Rs. A sum of Rs. 3.00 crore has been sanctioned. As per NIDHI guidelines, the fund provides for soft loans to various start-ups for business growth, royalty sharing or purchase of minority equity stake of the start-up. However, since VJTI-TBI is registered as a charitable trust, the charitable trust cannot acquire minority equity stake as per the provisions of Section 13 (1) (d) of the Income-tax Rules, 1961. However, a company established under Section-8 of the Indian Companies Act, 2013 under the Income Tax Rules, 1961 can buy a minority equity stake. Therefore, the matter of registering VJTI-TBI as a Section-8 company in the Companies Act, 2013 was under consideration of the Government.
The government's decision:
In view of the above, the order approves registration of VJTI Technology Business Incubator (VJTI-TBI) as a company under Section-8 of the Indian Companies Act, 2013, established on Not for Profit basis for receiving funds from the Central Government for setting up of Incubation Centre at Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute, Mumbai under the umbrella programme NIDHI National Initiative for Development and Harnessing Innovations (NIDHI) funded by Department of Science Technology (DST), Government of India.
