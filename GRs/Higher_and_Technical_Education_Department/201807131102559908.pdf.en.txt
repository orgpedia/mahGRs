A decision was made to provide a living wage. Also, a provision has been made in this government decision to run hostels by registered institutions. By the Government decision dated 16.06.2018 in Reference No.5, the income limit of the scheme is Rs. 8 lakh. The scholarship will be provided to eligible students from the academic year 2018-19. Out of this, a limit of 500 beneficiary students per district has been fixed for students having income between Rs. 1.00 lakh and Rs. 8.00 lakh. There is no ceiling on the number of beneficiary students for students earning up to Rs. 1.00 lakh.
A proposal is under consideration of the Government to provide a grant of Rs. 5.00 crore per district to the registered institutions for construction of hostels for students belonging to economically weaker sections admitted to professional courses. It will take some time to finalise it. Also, after giving this grant to the concerned institution, it will take a lot of time to actually build the hostel facility.
At present, various hostel schemes are being implemented in the state for the students of various backward classes. However, no hostel scheme is being implemented for students belonging to economically weaker sections. It is necessary to provide separate hostel facilities so that students from economically weaker sections who take admission in professional courses are not inconvenienced due to lack of space and are not hindered in pursuing their education. The decision regarding Maratha reservation and other demands was taken in the context of the Government decision dated 04.10.2017. The Cabinet Sub-Committee under the Chairmanship of Minister (Revenue, Relief& Rehabilitation, Public Works) met on 11/07/2018. In the meeting, Dr. It was also approved to lay down the general procedure and rules for leasing out government and other buildings for running hostels to the registered societies under the' Punjabrao Deshmukh Hostel Maintenance Allowance Scheme'. Accordingly, it was under the consideration of the government to formulate general procedures and rules for leasing out government and other buildings for running hostels to institutions registered under the Dr. Punjabrao Deshmukh Hostel Maintenance Allowance Scheme.
Government Decision: The Government is approving the implementation of the scheme for leasing out buildings owned by Government/ Local Bodies/ Boards to registered institutions for running hostels under the Dr. Punjabrao Deshmukh Hostel Maintenance Allowance Scheme from the academic year 2018-19.
