Preamble: The Government has approved to bring the colleges in 10 taluks which do not have any aided college on grant basis under the Government decision dated 17th June 1995.
Thereafter, a permanent no-subsidy policy has been adopted in the State from the academic year 2001-2002.
Due to the increase in the number of new taluks in the state, there was a demand for sanctioning on a grant basis in those taluks where there is no aided college or faculty. In pursuance of this demand, it has been decided to sanction 100% grant-in-aid to one college/ faculty in each taluka. The decision was made on February 4, 2008.
The proposals received from the concerned agencies in pursuance of the above Government decision are referred to vide No. Scrutiny was done by the Task Force Group constituted under Government Decisions 6 and 7. After considering the recommendations of the Task Force Group and as approved by the Cabinet in its Report dated 28.04.2022, the Government was considering bringing the existing faculties mentioned against the name of the college in Form-A and Form-B of the Government Decision on 100% subsidy.
