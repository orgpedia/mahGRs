Introduction: As per the decision of the Government dated 7th October, 2017, the Rajarshi Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj Tuition Fee Scholarship Scheme was implemented from the academic year 2017-18 for eligible students belonging to economically weaker sections. The income limit under the scheme has been increased to Rs. 8.00 lakh from the academic year 2018-19.

However, the government has received information that in the academic year 2018-19, some institutions have charged 100 per cent tuition fees from students. The first instalment of the tuition fee amount payable to eligible students under this scheme will be credited to the bank account of the beneficiary students in October, 2018.
Circular: If the institutions have taken 100 percent of the fee amount from the students eligible for the Rajarshi Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj Tuition Fee Scholarship Scheme in the academic year 2018-2019 at the time of admission, this amount should be returned to the student immediately.
