From the academic year 2017-18 onwards, the reimbursement of 50% of the tuition fee will be credited directly to the bank account of the eligible students.
Many educational institutions in the state insist on paying 100 percent tuition fee at the time of admission while admitting students from economically weaker sections or do not admit students without paying 100 percent tuition fee. At the time of actual admission, such students are expected to take only 50 per cent of the amount accounted for by the educational institutions. The remaining 50 per cent of the scholarship amount will be deposited directly into the bank accounts of the students by the government and thereafter the students will have to pay it to the educational institutions. Accordingly, it is hereby informed that all the concerned educational institutions while admitting students belonging to economically weaker sections should not insist on payment of 100% of the tuition fee or full amount at the time of admission by the eligible students. Students belonging to economically weaker sections who are entitled to 100% reimbursement of tuition fees should not be forced to pay tuition fees at the time of admission. Also, 50 per cent fee reimbursement will be given to the students who have paid 50 per cent of the tuition fee.
