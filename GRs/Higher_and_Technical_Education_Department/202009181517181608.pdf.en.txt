The satellite centre can be set up within a radius of 200 km from the main centre of the college. (In exceptional circumstances, this limit may be increased to 300 km.) However, the satellite centre cannot be outside the purview of the university.
In exceptional circumstances, if such a Centre is to be established outside the jurisdiction of the University concerned but as a special case for a special research or extension project within the limits of the State of Maharashtra, prior approval of the University in whose jurisdiction the site of the proposed Centre falls shall be required. However, the condition of prior approval of other universities will not be applicable to the satellite centres proposed by Kavi Kulguru Kalidas Vishwavidyalaya Ramtek. Also, if a satellite centre of a college affiliated to Shrimati Nathibai Damodar Thackersey Women's University, Mumbai, is to be set up in another state, prior permission of that state will be required.
Along with the proposal, the organization should submit a five-yearly clear project plan with the purpose and plan of setting up the satellite center. The application form to be submitted in the prescribed manner should be prepared by each university according to the local conditions. Also, the university should frame adequate rules in terms of laboratory materials, books, etc. required for the proposed course or project.
Under the concept of Aspirational District, priority should be given to start satellite centers in rural and tribal areas.
At least one skill certificate course must be started in the satellite center. As satellite centres can be used to increase the use of online and Open Distance Learning (ODL) methods as suggested in the National Education Policy, it is mandatory to make available the necessary information technology, systems in the satellite centre.

A college will initially be recognized as a single satellite center. Approval for additional satellite centre will be considered after at least 3 years of operation of the satellite centre.
The affiliation of the Satellite Centre should be renewed once in every 3 years in the prescribed manner and the half-yearly work of the Satellite Centre should be submitted by the College to the University in the prescribed format. Also, the college should keep a separate financial account of the satellite centre.

During the first five years of regular conventional courses, research, extension programmes and academic courses in satellite centres, co-curricular programmes, continuing education programmes, certificate in skill education and development, diploma, advanced diploma courses, post-doctoral activities and social welfare activities and industrial projects can be approved. Since satellite centres are expected to be set up primarily for skill development of youth, priority should be given to skill-based courses.
National Service Scheme (N.S.S.), National Cadet Course (N.C.C.) C.C.) and the Satellite Centre should be considered as the point of contact for sports, skills, research extension, programmes and projects.

Also, financial assistance can be provided by the District Planning Development Board under the Minimum Skills Programme with administrative approval at the district level.
If a course in the Modular Employment Scheme List is to be run by a satellite center, the criteria under the relevant mission will remain applicable.
19 above. Verification Committee as prescribed in 1.4. The number of Expert Committees as prescribed in 1.8 shall be decided by the Universities taking into account the scope of the Satellite Centres to be established in that year and shall ensure that the work is carried out within the prescribed time frame.
