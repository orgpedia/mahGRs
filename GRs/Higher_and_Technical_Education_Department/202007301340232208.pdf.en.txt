Reference- 1) Letter from the Director, Higher Education, Pune No. Ushisham/ 2018/1863/ Chashim/ Prasa-3/ D. 15.02.2018 2) Department of Higher and Technical Education, Government Resolution, No. DBA-2008/ (86/2008)/ Coordination, dated 18.10.2009 Introduction Many great personalities and social reformers of Maharashtra have played an important role in the social, political, educational, ideological formation and development of Maharashtra. The literature written by these great personalities and social reformers and the literature written by the scholars on the lives of these great personalities brings to the fore the life story of such people, their struggle, their sacrifice for the society and the nation, and taking inspiration from this, the present generation contributes to the development of the nation and the state. Based on this and recognizing the importance of such personalities and reformers, in order to reach the general public as well as the students, under the Department of Higher and Technical Education, the Charitra Sadhan Publication Committees of the great men Rajarshi Shahu Maharaj, Mahatma Jotiba Phule, Bharat Ratna Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, Sahityaratna Lokhandhir Annabhau Sathe, and Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad are working.
In the above new context, the ideals of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's activism and political and social experiments are equally important. The biography and work of this king, who brought progressive changes in Indian governance and social reforms, is an inspiration to the new generation and rulers, but the experience, experiments and documents of the Maharajas political career can be of great use to the civil servants, advanced scholars of management, architects, legal scholars and scientists, so the government was considering the formation of the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Charitra Sadhan Prakashan Samiti to undertake a comprehensive program of collection, editing and publication of documents and reference materials of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's career.
