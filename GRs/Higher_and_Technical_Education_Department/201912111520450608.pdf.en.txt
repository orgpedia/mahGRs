The High Court in Public Interest Petition No. 85/2018 dated 7.11.2019 as follows:
"It appears that the petitioner is in Government service and there is no averment in the petition that for filing the present Writ Petition for public interest, permission of the Competent Authority was obtained as required by the rules. The petitioner in his affidavit filed under Rule 7 of the Bombay High Court Public Interest Litigation Rules, 2010 given an undertaking to pay cost as shall be ordered by this court, if it is ultimately held that the petition is frivolous or has been filed for extraneous consideration and lacks bonafide. We fail to understand as to how the petitioner is concerned with the benefits granted to the teachers working under the collages/institutions run by the education department of the State Government. The petitioner claims to be an active social worker and we are not satisfied about the bonafides of the petitioner. Apart from the fact that the Public Interest Litigation cannot be entertained in service matters. We therefore, dismiss this petition."
