Setting up of a committee to study the rationale for converting the CGPA into a percentage for determining the quality of students and to allocate equal grades to all students.
The Government of Maharashtra
Department of Higher and Technical Education
GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: SRIKH- 2021/ PR No. 49/ VISHI- 3, Mantralaya, Mumbai 400 032,
Date is February 22, 2021
The proposal:
All non-agricultural universities in the state have been directed to implement the Choice Based Credit System in the state from the academic year 2015-16 as directed by the Central Government. Accordingly, the universities have issued circulars at their level. Grades are given by the university as per CGPA, but there is a variation in the formula of converting grades into marks by each university. Similarly, a certain category cannot be converted into a certain set of attributes. In the B category, 50 to 55 points are indicated.
However, there was confusion as to how many marks the students should score in 50 to 55 packs. Also, in some cases, the eligibility of the students cannot be determined.
As a result, there is a lot of confusion and misconception among the students about the CGPA and its equivalent percentage. In order to remove this disparity and to allocate equal grades to all the students, the government was considering the formation of a committee of experts to conduct a study.
The government's decision:
A committee of the following experts is being constituted to study the issue of converting the CGPA into a percentage to determine the quality of students and to allocate equal grades to all students according to their scores.

The Committee shall submit its report to the Government within one month and the University in which the meetings of the Committee are held shall pay the honorarium and allowances of the non-official members. Also, is it possible to have a uniform formula for converting the CGPA into percentage to address the disparities? This should be considered by the committee.
