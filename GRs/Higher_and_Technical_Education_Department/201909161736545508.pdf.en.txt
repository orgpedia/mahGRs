The Government of Maharashtra
Department of Higher and Technical Education
Governing Decision No.: Parochial- 2019/110/19)/ Special-4
Hutatma Rajguru Chowk, Madam Cama Marg
Ministry, Mumbai: 400032.
The date: September 16, 2019.
The proposal:
" Swachh Bharat Abhiyan" is being implemented with great enthusiasm at every level across India.
" Swachh Bharat Abhiyan" is moving towards cleanliness from villages to big cities. From children to the elderly, everyone takes part in it. The state of Maharashtra has done a commendable job in the' Swachh Bharat Abhiyan."
The population in Maharashtra has been increasing at a fast pace. Cities have become cities and towns have become cities. This is leading to an increase in the amount of garbage and filth, which is turning into a serious problem. This has a direct impact on the health of the people and the environment of the state.
Therefore, along with the" Swachh Bharat Mission," there is a need to establish a" Swachh Bharat Vishwavidyalaya" for research, education and permanent solutions to sanitation related problems.
The government is planning to set up a Swachch Bharat Vishwavidyalaya at Sevagram in Wardha to commemorate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
GOVERNMENT DECISION: In pursuance of the establishment of Swachh Bharat Vishwavidyalaya, Sevagram, Wardha, a Study Committee under the Chairmanship of Shri Vinod Tawde is being constituted as follows.
