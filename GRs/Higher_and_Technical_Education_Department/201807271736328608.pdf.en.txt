Subject:- Regarding the visit of all the boys and girls taking admission in the first class of the university to the local self-government institutions.
Our country has adopted a three-tier democratic system and the Constitution has given the right to all persons above the age of 18 to vote and stand for the members of various institutions.
After the amendment of 73rd and 74th constitutions, during the elections to local bodies (Municipal Corporations, Municipal Councils/ Nagar Panchayats, Zilla Parishads/ Panchayat Samitis, Gram Panchayats) through the State Election Commission, the following issues have come to the fore: i) Children are not aware that their names are expected to be registered in the electoral rolls after crossing the age of 18 years and ii) Children under the age of 18 years do not have special knowledge about" Democracy,"" Election and Good Governance.
In the last two years, the State Government has taken several steps as per the instructions of the State Election Commission on these two issues.
(1) Amendments in the admission form of the first class of the University- All the boys and girls taking admission are required to give a certificate of the following items in the admission form:
On completion of 18 years of age, I will register my name in the electoral roll.

Department of Agriculture and Padum No.-37/ Mafsu, dated May 5, 2017)
(ii) Mandatory introduction of Module on" Democracy, Elections and Good Governance" in the Foundation Course of all subjects for all boys and girls taking admission in the first class of the University.
All universities, colleges under them and all election related machinery (e.g. The Collector, Municipal Commissioner, Voter Registration Officer, etc.) should have initiated action. It is believed that children who enter the first class will get a little information about" democracy, elections and good governance."
As a next step, it would be appropriate to inform all the children about the conduct of elections by visiting their nearby local bodies. In this regard, the government has issued the following orders:
Government Order:
(i) The Universities and all the colleges affiliated to them should prepare a plan of visit in consultation with the District Council, Municipal Corporation, Panchayat Samiti, Municipal Council, Nagar Panchayat, Gram Panchayat etc. and all the offices under them so that all the boys and girls taking admission in the first and corresponding classes of the University (including Medical Engineering, Polytechnic, ITI etc.) can visit their nearby local bodies.
(ii) For this purpose, the Vice-Chancellor/ Registrar shall hold a meeting with the Divisional Commissioner, Collector, Municipal Commissioner, Chief Executive Officer and prepare a plan of action.
It should be organized in such a way that the children can easily visit the local bodies near their homes.
(iv) Through this visit, all the boys and girls should be given an opportunity to see the provisions of the Constitution and the Local Self-Government Act, as well as the actual proceedings.
The Divisional Commissioner and Vice-Chancellors of the universities should take the initiative to make this programme a success.
