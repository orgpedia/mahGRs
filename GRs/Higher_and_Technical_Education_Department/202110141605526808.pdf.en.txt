Introduction: National Service Scheme (NSS) is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme under which the number of students is sanctioned by the Central Government every year to the Universities/ Institutions for two activities, namely, regular programmes and special camps. However, since the Central Government has sanctioned 3,27,700 students for the State of Maharashtra and 65,500 students for the newly created Universities in 2021-22, it was under consideration of the Government of Maharashtra to allocate the total number of students to the State of Maharashtra University/ Institution wise, by sanctioning the number of students from the approved Universities but less than the number of students actually enrolled in the previous year.
GOVERNMENT DECISION: As mentioned in the foregoing, regarding the approval of the number of students for the year 2021-22 for the National Service Scheme, 65,500 students have been approved for the regular programme and 32,750 for the special camp programme, with a category-wise distribution of 11.8 per cent for SCs, 9.4 per cent for STs and 78.8 per cent for others, with 7,729 for SCs, 6,157 for STs and 51,614 for others.
