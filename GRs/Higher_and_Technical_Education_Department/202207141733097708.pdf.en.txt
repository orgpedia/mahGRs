Accordingly, a Scrutiny Committee was constituted under the Chairmanship of Director, Higher Education, Maharashtra State, Pune vide Government Order dated 22.11.2018.

In the interim period. The Court in the said PIL vide order dated 23.01.2019 and dated 20.3.2019, has awarded a total of 101 teachers under CAS in the form of grant of Grade Pay of Rs. The report had stated that there is no need to check the eligibility of API score as per the provisions of the University Grants Commission for determining the 9000/- and the eligibility of the remaining 27 teachers needs to be checked. Accordingly, a total of 128 teachers have been given post-facto recognition under the Government Decision dated 05.8.2013 by convening a meeting of the Committee constituted under the chairmanship of the then Secretary, Higher and Technical Education and 27 such teachers who have completed 3 years of service before 01.01.2006 and have been eligible for placement after verification of API marks. Out of total 08 faculty members remaining 06 and 02 who have been left out, the placement of Dr. Lakshman Kashinathrao Moharir as Associate Professor is dated 23.9.2010 i.e. after 30.6.2010, as per rules, his API score needs to be checked and his proposal for placement needs to be placed before the constituted selection committee. Therefore, since the remaining 07 teachers are completing 03 years of age from 01.01.2006 to 30.6.2010, the matter of post-facto approval of the placement done at the zonal level was under consideration of the Government.
