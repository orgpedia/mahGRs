The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared tobacco as a global health problem. About 50 lakh people die every year in the world and about 10 lakh people in India due to diseases caused by tobacco. Tobacco use is the cause of heart disease, lung disease and other non-communicable diseases. Tobacco use at a young age makes it difficult to quit the habit and can lead to various non-communicable diseases. As the increasing rate of tobacco consumption among school/ college students and youth is a matter of concern, the concerned schools/ colleges/ educational institutions should lodge a complaint with the police if tobacco is being sold within 100 yards of the school/ college campus to make it a tobacco-free area.
The Government of India has enacted the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) Act, 2003.
