However, while allocating 25% of teaching positions to regular teachers at a surcharge, the total workload of each regular occupancy should not be more than 1.5 times their regular workload (i.e. not more than 18Ã— 1.5= 27 hours).

| number of students (9) | Necessary positions for the second turn | Accepted positions (50%) | Residential (25%) | Posts for taking additional charge from the working teacher cadre in the first shift (4) | Educational Charges to be borne as surcharge (Hourly) (6) |
| 180                    | There are 9 posts                       | 4.5 Posts                | 2.25 Posts        | 2.25 Posts                                                                               | 18x 2.25= 40                                              |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As per RACANA 6, the academic workload of additional 25% posts (2.25) from the first shift teaching cadre for the second shift is 40 hours.
Suppose, if the workload of 40 hours is taken equally by the available 5 teachers of the first shift (8 hours each), then the one month remuneration of a teacher should be fixed as 25% of the salary (salary+ grade pay) and above dearness allowance as follows.
For example, the prevailing Dearness Allowance would have been 119%,= 8/18 [(Earned Salary+ Grade Pay) x 25/100+ 119/ 100 (Earned Salary+ Grade Pay) x 25/100]= 8/18 [(Earned Salary+ Grade Pay) x 25/100] x 2.19.
This additional salary is for a total of 32 hours in a month i.e. 4 weeks. The ratio of theory to practical workload for each additional assignment will be 1:2. If a teacher is on leave/ absent for a period of one week or more, he/ she should be paid for that month in proportion to the attendance.
