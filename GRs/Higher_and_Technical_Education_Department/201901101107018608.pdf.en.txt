FRA/ Sh. Letter/ 2019/12, dated 07/01/2019
Circular:
While the Tuition Fee Committee was in existence to fix the fees for professional courses, as per the directions of the Committee, after the first year fee is sanctioned for the courses under the Directorate of Technical Education, from the academic year 2012-2013 to 2015-16, an increase of 8% fee is given from the second year and the increased fee is applicable till the completion of the course. The increase was expected in educational and developmental charges. After the Fee Regulatory Authority comes into existence under the Maharashtra Unaided Private Professional Educational Institutions (Regulation of Admission and Fee) Act, 2015 with effect from the academic year 2016-17, the fee as approved by the Fee Regulatory Authority under Section 14 (6) of the Act shall be applicable to the candidates admitted in that unaided institution during that academic year and shall remain so till the completion of the course of such students in the institution concerned.
While verifying the fees paid by the institutions in the MahaDBT portal, many institutions did not increase the fees in the educational fee as well as the developmental fee as per the directions of the then Education Fee Committee. If the fee paid by the institutions is less than the fee fixed by the then committee/ authority, the said fee has been approved by the Authority. However, now many organizations are demanding that the fees they have paid on the portal should be revoke or rejected by the authority as they are low or incorrect. At present, the online applications of the students for the relevant scholarship schemes for the academic year 2018-19 have been scrutinized by the Institute and the applications have been scrutinized by the Divisional Offices and Divisional Offices of Technical Education

The directorate is receiving and accordingly, the process of preparing its online payment is underway and the process of disbursing the benefit has also been done.
In view of the above, the Government has decided not to allow any change in the tuition fee paid by the institution under the Rajarshi Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj Tuition Fee Scholarship Scheme in the academic year 2018-19, even if it does not pay the tuition fee on the MahaDBT portal, taking into account the 8% increase payable in the academic year 2016-17 as approved by the previous Tuition Fee Committee. However, before disbursing the second installment of the scholarship, the institutions which have demanded the change of fees, the Joint Director of Technical Education will check how much the institutions have actually charged from the students and give them the opportunity to make changes on the MahaDBT portal. Further action in this regard should be taken by the Director, Technical Education and Secretary, Fee Regulatory Authority.
