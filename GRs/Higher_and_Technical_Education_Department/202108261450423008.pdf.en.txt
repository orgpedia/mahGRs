circular
It has come to the notice of the government that non-teaching posts in non-agriculture universities affiliated and recognized non-government aided colleges under the Directorate of Higher Education in the state are not being filled by adopting the method of recruitment. The colleges do not fix the point numbers while conducting the recruitment process. Therefore, the certificate is not issued by the department concerned. Also, the age, experience, qualification, etc. of the candidates are not taken into consideration. Such cases come up when the department is in the process of determining the grant-in-aid of a college under the control of the Joint Director. The employees appointed during this period continue to work in government-approved posts for a long time and demand the government to regularize the services over time and if they are informed that the said appointments are invalid, they file an appeal in the court against this order. The court decides against the government because the appointed employee has been working in a government-subsidized post and has paid the salary in the government salary subsidy. Therefore, it is time for the government to regularize the services of such ineligible candidates and give them service benefits and in case the conditions of service entry rules have to be relaxed to comply with the court order.
In this regard, the provisions of the Government Order dated 04.01.1989 and 08.8.1991 are self-explanatory. However, as mentioned above, such irregularities occur frequently and the affected employees approach the court. As a result, it is seen that decisions are being taken against the government due to lack of proper action by the concerned in time. In order to prevent such anomalies in future, the concerned Divisional Joint Director (Higher Education) and the Non-Government Aided Colleges under his control shall strictly follow the following procedure:

Government Circular No. Parichay-2021/ PR No.96/ MC.5,
(a) The educational qualification, qualification, experience, age criteria and technical qualification prescribed for the posts are to be strictly considered while carrying out the process of appointment to the Government recognized grant post.
(b) The point number of the year of appointment shall be determined by the concerned authority in the first instance while carrying out the process of appointment to a Government recognized grant-in-aid post.
e) While implementing the process of appointment to the government-funded post, a certificate of appointment should be obtained from the concerned Divisional Joint Director for recruitment to the post as per the point list.
(e) If there are several colleges of the same institution on the same subject on grant/ non-grant/ permanent non-grant basis and a post is made admissible in a grant-in-aid position on the basis of the number of students in a fixed workload, then no appointment/ transfer of staff on grant-in-aid basis shall be made without conducting any selection/ recruitment process by the college.
In case of such illegal appointment/ transfer, if the Government grants are disbursed by the concerned Divisional Joint Director without checking the validity of the post in the same selection year, the concerned Divisional Joint Director shall be liable and disciplinary action shall be taken against him accordingly.
f) Even if the salary of the employees has been disbursed on the account of the grant college as per the pay sheet submitted by the college, the college should take action to pay the salary from the government salary grant only after obtaining the necessary approval from the office of the concerned Divisional Joint Director.
(h) However, in case of such irregularity, the salary from the Government Salary Grants will not be applicable to the appointed employees under any circumstances. In such a situation, if the college pays the salary, the entire responsibility of the salary will remain with the concerned college.
(l) The General Administration Department shall strictly comply with the provisions made by the Government in the circular dated 25th August, 2005 and the instructions issued thereunder from time to time while filling up the posts of non-teaching staff in the non-agricultural universities affiliated and recognized non-government aided colleges under the Directorate of Higher Education.
