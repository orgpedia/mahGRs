International Women's Day was established in 1975 by the United Nations as International Women's Day. International Women's Day is a global day celebrating the cultural, political and social achievements of women. The day is observed globally to raise awareness of the women's rights movement by bringing attention to issues such as violence and abuse against women in support of action against gender inequality around the world.
