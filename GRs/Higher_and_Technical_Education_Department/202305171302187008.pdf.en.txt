Government of India, Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, Shastri Bhawan, New Delhi G 20011/2/2023-NSS, dated- 17.04.2023.
Introduction: National Service Scheme is a 100% Central Share Scheme and every year the Central Government grants the State of Maharashtra the number of students for two activities under the National Service Scheme, namely, Regular Activities and Special Camps, along with category wise break-up of SCs 11.8 per cent, STs 9.4 per cent and other categories 78.8 per cent. The percentage of self-employed students sanctioned is at least 20% of the total number of government-aided students and the maximum number of self-employed students can be more than that.
Proposals for affiliation of new universities and recognition of increased number of students in the year 2023-24 have been received and the Government was considering to allocate a total of 1,62,000 number of self-employed students for the State University/ Directorate/ Institution wise by sanctioning them from the sanctioned strength of other universities but the actual enrolment is less than the number of students distributed in the previous year.
GOVERNMENT DECISION: As mentioned in the Preamble, in the year 2023-24, for the National Service Scheme, the total number of students sanctioned for regular activities is 1,62,000 for regular activities and 81,000 for special camps (50% of the sanctioned strength for regular activities), with category wise break-up of regular activities as ST-1, 199, 116116, ST-15, 228 and OBC- 1,27,656.
