is necessary. The new school year is going to start soon. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to hold back the future of students, their career for such an unlimited period.
Considering the actual situation in the state, it is very important to check the feasibility of meeting arrangements and other arrangements for conducting the final year examinations of the university due to the large number of students coming and going from different parts of the state for the examination. At present, many college buildings and hostels in the state are being used as quarantine centres. The decision regarding the conduct of these examinations is necessary as it is practically not possible to conduct the final semester/ final year examinations of the universities in such a situation as the outbreak of Corona virus (COVID-19) is on a large scale in the state.
As per the prevailing procedure, the examination system involves a number of processes, including preparation of question papers, arranging sittings for the examination, checking answer sheets, preparing mark sheets, declaring results, revaluation, police bandobust for the examination, etc. It requires a large administrative machinery and manpower and if one of the participants in the process gets infected with COVID-19, it cannot be ruled out that a large number of other participants may also get infected.
This can pose a serious threat to the health of students, teachers, police and other stakeholders in the administration of the university/ educational institution.
In this background, the State Level Committee appointed for planning on the basis of the guidelines of the University Grants Commission in the context of rescheduling and publishing the results of the academic year 2019-20 and 2020-21 in all non-agricultural universities and affiliated colleges in the state has submitted its report to the government. The report was submitted to the government on May 6, 2020. It was approved on May 8, 2020. Based on the recommendations of this committee, plans have been made regarding educational programs in non-agricultural universities and affiliated colleges in the state. However, in the given circumstances, it has become necessary to take effective measures and take decisions regarding the conduct of final semester/ final year examinations as per these recommendations.
In view of the COVID-19 pandemic situation in the State, the final of the undergraduate/ postgraduate courses of conventional (non-professional) courses for the academic year 2019-20 has been postponed.
