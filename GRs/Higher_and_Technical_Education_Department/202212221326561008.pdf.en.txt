The proposal:
The general policy of the government is to ensure balanced educational development in all departments of the state. In the last few years, not only in the country but also in the Naxal-affected areas of the state, the government has noticed that the ratio of college education of girls is very low. In view of the above, the proposal for filling up of teaching and non-teaching posts in five Women's Colleges in the Naxal affected areas was placed before the Sub-Committee of the Finance Department in its meeting dated 18.10.2022 as it is very essential for the overall development of the personality of the girl students in the Naxal affected areas by bringing them into the mainstream of education. Earlier, the posts of principal, physical education director and librarian were isolated and they were given 100 per cent recruitment.

have been approved to do. However, the posts of physical education director and librarian have not been approved yet. Therefore, since the Principal is a responsible post as an administrative as well as a drawing and disbursing officer, the matter of filling up 50 per cent of the posts excluding the said posts and accordingly getting the Naharakat certificate for filling up the said posts was under the consideration of the Government.
The government's decision:
As the overall development of the personality of the girl students in the Naxalite affected areas is essential for their educational and social development by bringing them into the mainstream of education, the following sub-committee constituted to approve the filling up of vacancies in the post of teachers and non-teaching posts in five women colleges in the following two institutions of the Naxalite affected areas under the Directorate of Higher Education is being approved:
