The High Court in Public Interest Petition No. 85/2018 dated 7.11.2019 as follows:
It appears that the petitioner is in Government service and there is no averment in the petition that for filing the present Writ Petition for public interest, permission of the Competent Authority was obtained as required by the rules. The petitioner in his affidavit filed under Rule 7 of the Bombay High Court Public Interest Litigation Rules, 2010 given an undertaking to pay cost as shall be ordered by this court, if it is ultimately held that the petition is frivolous or has been filed for extraneous consideration and lacks bonafide. We fail to understand as to how the department is concerned with the benefits granted to the teachers working under the colleges/ institutions run by the education department of the state government. The mujahideen claims to be an active social worker and we are not satisfied about the bonafides of the mujahideen. Apart from the fact that the Public Interest Litigation cannot be entertained in service matters. Therefore, we dismiss this petition. " Ma. The High Court passed the above order in Public Interest Litigation No. 85/2018 has been resolved. Therefore, considering the report of the Screening Committee constituted under the Chairmanship of Director, Higher Education, Pune vide Government Resolution dated 22.11.2018 and the recommendations made by the Committee constituted vide Government Resolution dated 5.8.2013 in its meeting held on 17.7.2019, the Government was considering the matter of determining the grade pay of Associate Professor in Government Colleges/ Institutions under the Sixth Pay Commission.
