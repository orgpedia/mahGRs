Preamble: The Maharashtra Public Universities Act, 2016 has been enacted by the Government of Maharashtra to enhance the quality of higher education in the state. Section 109 (4) of the Act provides for time-bound approval of new courses of study, subjects, faculties, additional batches. Also, Section 109 (9) provides that the Government shall prescribe procedures for carrying out the implementation of these provisions. Pursuant to the above provisions, the procedure for approval of AGM course of study, subject, faculty, additional batch from the academic year 2018-19 has been laid down in the Code of Conduct No. 2 The government decision here was prescribed under the date 13.09.2017. In this Government Decision, Paragraph No. 1.7. Universities have mentioned about accepting applications through online system.
Accordingly, some of the 12 non-agricultural universities in the state have developed an online system for accepting applications for new courses of study, subjects, faculties, additional batch approvals. However, as there is no uniformity in the online system developed by these universities, a "New College Permission System (NCPS)" has been developed at the government level for new courses of study, subjects, faculties, additional batch approvals from this academic year.

It is hereby clarified that the due date for submission of proposal by interested institutions to the University and submission of the proposal by the Universities to the Government after scrutiny shall be the date of the next office day if it is a public / local holiday on the date specified in the Maharashtra Universities Act, 2016.

The number of expert committees prescribed in section 13 shall be decided by the universities taking into account the scope of the faculty, curriculum, subjects and additional faculty additions to be undertaken in that year and shall ensure that the work is carried out within the prescribed schedule.
2. From this academic year onwards, action should be taken as per the criteria prescribed further for sanctioning new courses of study, subjects, faculties, additional batches.
The criterion:
The University shall not forward to the State Government an application from an existing college or ecosystem of higher education for introduction of a new course of study, subject, faculty, additional batch, as specified in section 109 (6) of the Maharashtra Public University Act, if, - (a) it has not been either accredited or re-accredited by the National Assessment Council or the National Board of Accreditation (NBA), even if it is qualified and expected to be accredited or re-accredited as per the NAAC ratings; and (b) it is not compliant with the standards prescribed by the State Government.
Similarly, in the case of those who already have colleges, applications from further unrecognised institutions should not be recommended to the government.

Government Decision Number: NGC-2025 / E-1319878 / MASHI-4
The approval of new courses of study, subjects, faculties, additional batches, as per the prevailing policy of the Government, shall always be on a non-subsidised basis.
While recommending a new course, such course should not be recommended to the Government without the approval of the apex body / bela governing body if such course requires approval.
Proposals should be recommended only after ensuring that the existing courses of study, subjects, faculties, batches in the college for which new courses of study, subjects, faculties, additional batches are proposed are approved by the government, basic and physical facilities are available as per the norms prescribed by the government.
2.5 The colleges which have proposed new courses of study, subjects, faculties, additional batches, are required to attach with the application documents certifying the availability of additional physical and basic facilities as per the norms prescribed by the Government for the additional courses of study, subjects, faculties, additional batches and the University shall certify the same.
2.8 The Divisional Joint Director, Higher Education shall submit to the Government within the next 06 months a certificate stating that regular non-teaching staff has been appointed as per the prescribed norms for the college for which a new course of study, subject, faculty, additional batch has been proposed.
3. When universities send proposals to the government, they should be categorized into new courses of study, subjects, faculties, additional batches.
v. Universities should ensure that the proposals meet the prescribed criteria while forwarding the proposals to the government. Previously, universities have recommended proposals at the government level even if they do not meet the prescribed criteria when sending proposals. Hence, the government has had to face an unprecedented court case in such a recommended case. Then, if the proposal is submitted to the government without meeting the prescribed criteria, it is the sole responsibility of the government. The Vice-Chancellor and the President shall be the Board of Governors.
