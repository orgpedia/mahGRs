Government Resolution No. Parichay-2022/ P. No. 91/ Vishy-4

The proposal:
Self-financed universities are established for the development and promotion of higher education in the state. No fee concession is given by the government to the students studying in these universities. Considering the comparative educational facilities and the fees charged in self-financing universities, it was difficult for the economically weaker students to pay the fees charged while taking admission in self-financing universities. Against this backdrop, the government had received a request for exemption from academic fees for economically weaker students in self-financing universities in the state. Considering all the factors related to this and the need for a student-centric education system in the new National Education Policy, the government is taking the following decisions in this regard.
Government Decision: For a total of 10 percent of the students admitted to all self-financed universities in the state, who are economically weak according to the government criteria, 50 percent discount in the education fee will be given by the respective self-financed university according to merit, regardless of caste category. In addition, if the remaining students are to be exempted from the academic fee on the basis of financial infirmity or other criteria, the decision will be taken at the level of the concerned university.
The said educational fee shall include all fees charged by the University in any name and the exemption shall be applicable for the period from the date of admission to the course concerned till the completion of the course. The self-financed university will not receive any grant or other financial assistance from the government in this regard.
3. The procedure for grant of exemption from tuition fee as aforesaid shall be implemented by the respective self-financing university at the time of actual admission of the students. The self-financing university will submit a report to the government along with the details of the students who have been given the relevant concession within one month from the last date of the admission process. This will be reviewed by the government in a month. The orders will come into effect immediately.
