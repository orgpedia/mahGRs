Preamble: Guidelines have been issued under the Government decision dated 29th May, 2013 for the establishment of self-financing universities in the State, regulation of their functioning and their matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. A two-member committee under the chairmanship of Shri Arun Bongirwar, former Chief Secretary was constituted on 25th August, 2015 to revise the guidelines. The Bongirwar Committee had recommended that if the necessary land is not available to set up a self-financing university in the Mumbai city district, then the Vertical University Campus should be allowed in the Mumbai city district on the same lines as the Vertical University Campuses have been set up in New York, Washington and Tel Aviv.
The revised guidelines have been issued with the approval of the Cabinet under the Government Resolution dated January 19, 2019, accepting the recommendations of the Bongirwar Committee on necessary land, construction, endowment, financial matters, extension of the letter of intent, etc. However, the guidelines do not include the criteria for setting up a vertical university campus.
There is a demand from various sponsoring bodies to start a vertical university campus in the state. Therefore, a committee under the chairmanship of Mr. Jayant Banthia, former Chief Secretary, State of Maharashtra was formed under the Government decision dated February 27, 2020, to include in the guidelines for the establishment of self-financed universities in the State, after conducting a thorough study of the Vertical University Campus as suggested by the Bongirwar Committee. Based on the recommendation made by the committee and considering the suggestions and objections sought by it, the government was considering issuing a decision on the establishment of a vertical university campus.
