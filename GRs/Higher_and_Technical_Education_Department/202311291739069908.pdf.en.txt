The flagship college will be an academically high performing college/ institution with requisite infrastructure, trained faculty and faculty capable of guiding and coordinating the activities of the group university which will guide the constituent colleges/ institutions of the group university towards academic excellence and holistic development with a shared vision, act as coordinators, mobilize necessary resources, build capacities and develop professional outlook of the staff.
Under these guidelines, all colleges under the proposed group universities are to merge into a unified education system with emphasis on coordination, collaboration and holistic development. As part of this significant transformation, principals of colleges under group universities will be seamlessly adjusted to the administrative and academic responsibilities of their posts in line with the growth of a unified leadership approach. The policy aims to create a powerful network of educational institutions, bringing together resources, skills and innovative ideas to provide a holistic and holistic learning experience to students.
