Preamble: The guidelines have been issued under the relevant Government decisions regarding charging of registration fee and fixed deposit in the joint account for proposals for starting new institutions of diploma, degree, post-graduate/ diploma courses on non-grant basis, starting new courses in an existing institution or changing the approved intake capacity of the course. After the closure of an educational institution, there is a delay or non-payment by the institution regarding the payment of salaries and other financial benefits due to the employees there. As a result, court cases arise. Considering all these factors, various Government decisions mentioned above have been revised from time to time in respect of Fixed Deposits under the relevant Government decisions. Accordingly, in respect of opening of new institutions/ courses/ changes in the sanctioned intake capacity, the Directorate of Technical Education, Maharashtra State, Mumbai is following the procedure of allowing the interest on fixed deposits in the joint account of the Director, Directorate of Technical Education and the educational institutions to be credited to the accounts of the institution while renewing the term only after the expiry of the said term.
However, some of the educational institutions have approached the government seeking payment of interest for diploma courses even before the expiry of the term limits jointly held by the Directorate of Technical Education and the institutions. However, there is no explicit provision in the relevant Government decisions to credit the interest on fixed deposits to the accounts of the institutions before the expiry of the term. However, the possibility of demand for payment of premature interest in future from other private unaided institutions cannot be ruled out.
