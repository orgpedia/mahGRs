6) Department of Higher and Technical Education, Government Decision No. 248/ VC 3 dated 7/03/2019.
The proposal:
The National Mission on Higher Education (NMHE), a flagship programme of the Government of India, aims to ensure quality, equity and opportunity in higher education in Maharashtra. The decision has been taken in the Cabinet meeting held on 21/04/2015. In pursuance of the decision taken by the State Cabinet, the State Project Directorate has been established by the Government Decision of the above Reference No. 2 for effective implementation of the scheme in the State.
In the present scenario, it has become challenging for the existing big universities like Mumbai and Pune to control the large number of affiliated colleges. Universities are finding it difficult to conduct academic evaluation of colleges, to check whether the colleges provide the required physical facilities to raise the standard of higher education in the state.
In such a situation, if 3 to 5 colleges of the jurisdiction of the universities are combined and different faculties are formed and a group university is formed, then the available human resources and other available resources will be better utilized. Also, the group universities will be able to offer job-oriented courses in the fast-changing globalization trend. Group
