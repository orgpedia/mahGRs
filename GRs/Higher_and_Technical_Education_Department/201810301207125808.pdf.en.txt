The college offers three professional courses. The Government has decided to withdraw the notification dated 05.07.2018.
At present, there are 651 unaided diploma institutes in the state. Since these institutions were earlier declared as professional courses, the fees for these diploma courses were being determined by the regulatory authority constituted under this Act. However, now that these Diploma courses have been de-notified as Professional Courses vide Notification dated 5th July, 2018, the fees for non-aided Diploma Courses from the academic year 2018-19 cannot be assessed by the Regulating Authority. However, to ensure that these institutions do not charge exorbitant fees and do not cause undue financial burden to the students, it was necessary to create a business for determining the fees of these diploma institutions.
The government's decision:
In exercise of the powers conferred on the State Government by the provisions of Section 22 of the Maharashtra Unaided Professional Institutions (Regulation of Admission and Fee) Act, 2015, the Government hereby directs that the Fee Regulatory Authority shall determine the fee of the Unaided and Perpetually Unaided Diploma in Engineering and Technology, Diploma in Pharmacy and Diploma in Hotel Management and Catering Technology courses under the Directorate of Technical Education in the State, up to the academic year 2018-19, only if such institutions demand more fee for the academic year 2019-2020 or for the subsequent period.
