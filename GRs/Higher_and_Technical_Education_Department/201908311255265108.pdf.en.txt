Further, out of the proposals submitted by Shivaji University, Kolhapur and Punyashlok Ahilyadevi Holkar Solapur University, Solapur (01 Proposal) and Shivaji University, Kolhapur (06 Proposal) have been recommended under Fast Track Additional batches for the second and third year natural growth batches. However, as these proposals are not intended to be approved at the Government level under the Fast Track batches, the proposals for the additional natural growth batches (proposed by the Universities as Part-II and Part-III) mentioned in the Statement-B are being rejected under the Fast Track batches. However, these proposals have been separately communicated to Punyashlok Ahilyadevi Holkar Solapur University and Shivaji University, Kolhapur for examining them as per the procedure prescribed in the Government Resolution dated 31.05.2002 and 14.03.2011 and taking necessary action as per rules.
