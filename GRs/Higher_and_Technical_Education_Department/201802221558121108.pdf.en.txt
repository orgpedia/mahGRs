Introduction: The above. According to the above government decision, the reserve amount and the rate of admission fee charged by the individual members and institution members of the government departmental libraries and government district libraries in the state were as follows:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| A.A.      | Details             | Individual Member    | Member of Society (Registered Society) |
| 1         | reserve amount      | Rs. 100/-            | Rs.500/-                               |
| Entry fee | Rs.20/- (Bi-annual) | Rs.150/- (Bi-annual) |
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
However, since 1998, there has been no increase in the amount of reserve and admission fees for individual members of libraries and institution members. The price of books has increased in the last 20 years. Because of the increasing price of books, the number of members who cannot afford to buy books, the books become insufficient. Hence, the number of members has to be limited for the convenience of libraries and the smooth functioning of libraries. Considering all these aspects, the government was considering a proposal to revise the reserve amount and admission fee rates of individual members and institution members of government departmental libraries and government district libraries.
Government Decision: The Government is approving to revise the reserve amount and admission fee rates of individual members and institution members of Government Divisional Libraries and Government District Libraries as follows:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| A.A. | Details                     | Individual Member                  | Member of Society (Registered Society) |
| 1    | Refund amount               | Rs.500/-                           | Rs. 2500/-                             |
| 2    | Application Fee (bi-annual) | Rs.100/-+ Rs.10/- (Total Rs.110/-) | Rs.750/-+ Rs.25/- (Total Rs.775/-)     |
