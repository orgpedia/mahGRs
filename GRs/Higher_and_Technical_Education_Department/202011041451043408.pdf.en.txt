The millions of people living on the coast get a lot of benefit from the coast for employment and business. But the local youth are not getting the required scientific knowledge and education. There is not a single oceanographic university in India that offers high-quality education and research on oceanography. However, the government was considering setting up a committee to decide on the criteria for setting up a university in Konkan for subjects such as marine biology, marine geology, fisheries, technology, tourism, ecology and conservation.
The following committee is being constituted to recommend to the Government regarding the establishment of Maharashtra Ocean Applied Sciences University (MOASU) at Ratnagiri for the development of Konkan.
