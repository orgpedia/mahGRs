the Government Order
The Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) has launched the National Vocational Education Qualification Framework (NEQF) in 2011.
Accordingly, the Finance Department of the Central Government has implemented the National Skill Qualification Framework. Accordingly, the University Grants Commission (UGC) has decided not to grant recognition to business courses and community colleges through Deen Dayal Upadhyay Skill Centre based on higher education. Under this scheme, 1 year Diploma, 2 years Advanced Diploma and 3 years B.Sc. VOC degree will be awarded. Accordingly, the University Grants Commission has issued Guidelines for introduction of Bachelor of Vocation (B.Voc. Programmes in universities and colleges under the National Skills Qualifications Framework (NSQF) have been issued.
As per the eligibility criteria, the colleges affiliated to the university had submitted applications to the University Grants Commission (UGC) for recognition of courses offered by the Deen Dayal Upadhyay Skill Centre. These colleges are recognized by the University Grants Commission as B.Voc. The course has been approved. However, as per Section 109 of the Maharashtra Public Universities Act, 2016, these courses need government approval.
In order to achieve the objective for which the University Grants Commission has approved the B.Voc courses and community colleges under NSQF, it has been decided to establish a common control of the university and to ensure the norms and procedures to bring uniformity in the functioning of all the universities. A board of directors was formed. As per the suggestions given in the meeting of the committee, the concerned universities have resubmitted the proposals pending for government approval so far.
