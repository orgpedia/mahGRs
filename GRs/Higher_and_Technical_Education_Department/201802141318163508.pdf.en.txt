Introduction: It has been developed by the Directorate of Information and Technology from the academic year 2017-18 to provide the benefit amount under the Central and State Government sponsored scholarship/ tuition fee/ examination fee schemes to the eligible students. Some students are facing difficulties in registering their applications on this MahaDBT portal. Further, as the colleges are facing difficulties in forwarding the complete applications of the students to the government offices and the portal is yet to be fully operationalized for the first semester of 2017-18, it has been observed that it will take some time to make the amount of scholarship, tuition fee, examination fee etc. provided by the various departments to the students through the DBT portal.
Accordingly, the Cabinet in its meeting held on 21/11/2017 has decided to delete the Central and State Government sponsored scholarship/ freeship schemes from the MahaDBT portal for the academic year 2017-18. The proposal was submitted through the Social Justice and Special Assistance Department. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has approved the delisting of the schemes of the Department of Social Justice and Special Assistance, Department of School Education, Department of Tribal Affairs and Department of Minority Affairs from the Maha DBT system for the academic year 2017-18.
