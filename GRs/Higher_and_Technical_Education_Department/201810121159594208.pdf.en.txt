Preamble: The Maharashtra State Board of Technical Education Act No. 38, d. It came into force on 6 August 1997. The Maharashtra State Board of Technical Education (MSBSHTE) conducts the examination for admission to various engineering courses in the state. Under the Act of 1997, No. As per the provision in section 3, after the commencement of the Act," the Maharashtra State Board of Technical Education shall be constituted. 1.4.1999, Reference No. 1 here.

GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: TANVEYA-2018/ (P.S. 229/18)/ TANSHI-5
(3) The salaries and allowances of the employees on deputation shall be paid out of their funds in accordance with the rules prescribed by the Maharashtra State Board of Technical Education. The Board will bear the financial burden arising out of the acceptance of the said figure of 183 posts.
(5) The expenditure on deputation, salary, allowances of certain Gazetted Officers on the Board shall be carried forward in accordance with the existing procedure. "
The government decision No. As per the provisions of section 5, the Board has so far been receiving grants from the Government for the salaries and allowances of the officers working in 43 sanctioned technical posts in the Board. However, Section No. 3 and No. 5 are somewhat contradictory. The Maharashtra State Examination Board is an autonomous board and there is no provision in the Act that the government should bear the entire burden of salary and allowances of government officials working with the board. Therefore, since the Maharashtra State Board of Technical Education is self-sufficient, the government's austerity policy, the instructions issued by the Finance Department from time to time to cut down on salary/ revenue expenditure, all these factors have been taken into consideration. In the Governing Decision dated 15th November, 2010, No. 5 The matter of cancellation was under consideration of the government.
Government Decision: Reference No. 2 here. In the Government Resolution dated 15th November, 2010, No. 5 has been removed. As a result, the salary and allowances of any post in the figure approved in the Maharashtra State Technical Education Board will not be paid by the government.
(2) However, since the officers and employees of the State Government are working on deputation in the posts working in the Board, the salary subsidy for the posts sanctioned for the Board shall be paid through the HTE-Service mechanism so that the salary of the officers/ employees working in these posts is paid on time and their government and other allowances are properly met. However, it will be mandatory for the Board to reimburse the salary subsidy given by the Government to the State Government within 1 month after the end of the financial year.
(3) This Order is issued with the concurrence of the Finance Department and in its informal reference No. 440/18/ Expenditure-5, dated 4/05/2018 are being issued as per the consensus arrived at.
