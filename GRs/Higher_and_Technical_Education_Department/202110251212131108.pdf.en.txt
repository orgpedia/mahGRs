Even today, a sample of Sayajirao Gaekwad's work and political and social experiments can be useful. The Government of Maharashtra should take up a special action-project to raise the identity of this great leader who inspired the state's progress, for this purpose, the Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad Charitra Sadhan Prakashan Samiti has been formed.
