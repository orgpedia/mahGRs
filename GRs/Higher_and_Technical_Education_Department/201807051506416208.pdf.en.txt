Therefore, considering the difficulties in obtaining the validity certificate mentioned above and the educational interest of the students belonging to the backward classes, the Cabinet on Wednesday decided to issue a notification to this effect. In the meeting dated June 27, 2018, it was directed that appropriate action be taken in respect of exclusion of diploma courses from the purview of the Admission Regulatory Authority. Immediate action needs to be taken on this.
