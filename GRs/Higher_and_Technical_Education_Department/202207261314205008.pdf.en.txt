Preamble: Under Section 82 (5) of the Maharashtra University Act, 1994, the Government has issued Reference No. A total of 09 colleges have been approved on permanent non-grant basis under the government decision from 4th to 9th.
The government's policy is to ensure balanced educational development of all departments in the state.
The proportion of women in higher education needs to be increased as the proportion of girls in college education in Naxal-affected areas has been very low in the last few years. It is very important from the educational and social point of view to bring the girl students of Naxal affected areas in the stream of higher education and develop their personality. The Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) of girls in the Naxal-affected areas is lower than the state average. The GER of women of the states is 28.02 per cent, while the GER of Naxal-affected areas, especially Gadchiroli, Gondia and Bhandara districts, is 15.23 per cent, 15.78 per cent and 22.03 per cent respectively.
As the enrolment ratio of women in the Naxal-affected areas is found to be lower than the state average, providing grants to these colleges will increase the rate of education of girls in these areas. Taking this into consideration, a total of 5 colleges running on permanent non-grant basis in Naxal affected areas and fulfilling the prescribed criteria will be brought on grant.
