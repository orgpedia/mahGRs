3. Heat-related diseases (mercury 5), although insignificant in nature, are of serious concern from a global public health perspective.
According to data from the National Disaster Management Authority, Government of India, 24,233 people have died due to heat waves between 1992 and 2015. AMARAs of death cause a wide variety of co-morbidities.
National guidelines guide the development of heat wave resolution and heat action plans (HAPS). However, the challenge of local risk practices and evidence-based local referencing remains. The 37 HAPs at the city, district, and state levels in the country have provided a narrow view of the heat hazard but different local contexts have not been reported.
In this context, it is necessary to enable local authorities to make informed decisions and formulate policy through research and archival information on the health impacts of heat waves on the aforementioned vulnerable factors, the rapidly growing population, inadequate infrastructure, as well as climate variability and the impact of heat. It was under the consideration of the Government to create awareness, management, policy and measures for collection of scientific evidence / information regarding adverse health effects of unsafe heat waves on various (urban and rural; coastal and inland; hilly and landlocked) residents of the State, adults, pregnant women, outdoor workers and sick persons.
