Read:- 1) Government Decision No.- Stamp- 2001/276/ Q. No. 102/ M-1D. 20.08.2001.
Government Memorandum No. D. 31.10.2001.
Letter No.4/ E-Registration and E-Filing Amendment/ 1670, D. 14/10/2022.
The Proposal:
It is observed that the e-registration/ e-filing will progressively increase and at the same rate, the amount of document registration/ filing through the traditional mode will be reduced and the amount of document handling fee received from the traditional document registration/ filing will be reduced.
Even though e-registration/ e-filing is an online facility, the expenditure on maintenance of software, its upgradation, expenditure on servers, storage and e-registrar hardware and connectivity, dissemination of information, publicity and publicity, etc. will continue to be incurred. Therefore, to meet this expenditure, document handling charges for e-registration/ e-filing services need to be levied.
Under the e-registration, the document handling fee of Rs 300 for the live and license agreement, Rs 1000 for the registration of the agreement for the sale of a flat through e-registration mode and Rs 300 for the e-filing services through e-filing version-1 was under the consideration of the government and the amount of fee charged for the e-registration/ e-filing services was to be deposited in the" Personal Property Account" (PLA) opened in the name of the Inspector General of Registration and Controller of Stamps, Maharashtra State, Pune at the state level and in the name of the concerned officers at the district level.
Government's decision:
For Live and License Agreement under e-Registration, for registration of sale deed of flats through e-Registration mode and for e-filing services through e-Filing Version-1
