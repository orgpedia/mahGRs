The Proposal: -
Under the Government Decision dated 19.04.2023 and dated 16.02.2024, the Government implemented a comprehensive policy on sand mining, storage and sale through online system. Under this sand policy, a total of 247 sand depots were created in the state. There are now 99 sand depots operational as per the sanctioned period of this sand depot. The remaining sand depots have expired.
However, these sand depots are yet to be closed as the expired sand depots are yet to sell some of the sand stored during the sanctioned period. Also, due to violation of the terms and conditions mentioned in the agreement by some sand depot holders, this sand depot is left with the sand deposited before closing the sand depot. Depot-wise proposals in this regard have been submitted by various Collectorates. Therefore, the matter of determining the modus operandi in the case was under the consideration of the government.
Government Decision: - 1. Removal of balance sand in respect of shortfall in revenue as a result of non-execution of exact quantity of sand stored in sand depots, sold from sand depots but not picked up by customers within the prescribed time period, but stored but unsold in sand depots excavated before the expiry of the approved period in the sand depots, which have expired or are about to expire, shall be dealt with as follows: -
A. The Depot holder concerned should be given 1 month extension to sell the above sand.
b. Domestic beneficiaries should be given preference while selling sand from sand depots.
The customer concerned will be allowed a maximum of 7 days after 1 month to pick up the sold sand.
1. The entire sand should be disposed of through auction process if it remains to be borne in the sand depot despite the above operations. The rate received in the tender for this

Amounts should be deposited under headings 0853 and recorded on the Treasury system.
8. The amount of sand stored from the sand depot which will be sold and auctioned will be paid to the deposit holder by the Government as per the provisions of the relevant policy.
F. The sand sold from the sand depot but not picked up by the customers within the prescribed time frame and since it is not possible to weigh the exact quantity, the balance of the sand as per the fluctuation in the price should be recorded twice on the firewood system separately.
2) If the sand depot is cancelled in violation of the terms and conditions mentioned in the sand policy or the agreement, the remaining sand in the sand depot should be disposed of by auction. For this, the rate received in the tender should be considered as the price of the hand.
Proceeds from the auction should be deposited under headings 0853 and recorded on the Great Britain system. The sand depot holder will not be paid any amount by the government in this regard.
3) In the event of minor difficulties / issues arising in the course of the above-mentioned proceedings, the policy

will remain.
4) Steps should be taken to close the sand depots by following the above steps.
