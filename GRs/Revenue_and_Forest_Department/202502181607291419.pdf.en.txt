Preamble: - The Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, 1966 does not contain a manual regarding the territorial authorities responsible for implementing the revenue system. A similar manual has been prepared by the Revenue Department of the Government of Gujarat in the year 2008.

Under the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, 1966, it was under the consideration of the government to form a committee under the chairmanship of Divisional Commissioner, Konkan to recommend to the government for the preparation of a manual for the functioning of the District Collector, Provincial Officer, and Tehsildar. After due consideration, the Government have decided to constitute the following Committee.
Government Decisions: - A committee is being constituted as follows to recommend to the Government the preparation of a Collector's Manual under the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, 1966 for smooth functioning of revenue administration, land, law and order, quasi-judicial as well as grievance matters of the people.
