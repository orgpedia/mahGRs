Government Circular No: APPEAL-2023/ PR No.72/ J-1A
If any documents required for processing the application are available online as they are public, the quasi-judicial authority shall obtain the same online itself or seek the same from the concerned authority.
Provided that in no case, justice shall be denied by disposing of the application merely on technical grounds without giving adequate opportunity for procedural fulfilment as provided in the Act.
(6) The quasi-judicial authorities shall record in writing that such opportunity has been given to rectify the defects and the same shall be reflected in the records and proceedings of the case.
7.The disposal of such cases shall be justified only on the ground that procedural lapses have not been rectified in the present case despite being given adequate opportunity or after it is clear that such fulfilment is not being done deliberately or mischievously.
The said writ petition No. 6861 of 2016 dated 01/03/2023 is annexed herewith. Accordingly, all the Divisional Commissioners, Collectors and Regional Revenue Officers and authorities should take immediate action as per these guidelines and submit a compliance report to the government.
