Preamble The Government had sought information from the Divisional Commissioners, all the Revenue Departments about the pending paragraphs of the internal audit and the outstanding component/ year. Accordingly, there are 37,578 paragraphs pertaining to deposits pending with all the Collectorates, out of which the recoverable amount is Rs. 3015.60 crore, while the pendency of expenditure is 14,189 out of which the recoverable amount is Rs. 57.32 crore. Further, the number of components of deposits pending with all the District Collectors is 3403 and the number of components of expenditure is 3149. In terms of expenditure, in some districts, not a single unit has been audited since the inception of the team in 2005-06. Also, the percentage of deposits and expenses settled in the last 6 months is only 0.78%.
It is very regrettable and disappointing to note that the pendency of the aforesaid audit component year, paragraphs and the disposal ratio of the pending paragraphs indicate that a large amount of internal audit work is pending and the revenue receipts of the Government have not been assessed and recovered due to lack of expeditious disposal of objections. the Office of the Actual Accountant General

Before the audit is done, the internal audit team of the concerned office must be inspected for the current year, so that the deficiencies in the concerned office are removed and there are less objections in the audit of the Accountant General's office. Therefore, it is very important to conduct an internal audit of all the components in a timely manner.
It has come to the notice of the Government that the purpose of formation of these teams has not been successful as they have not been functioning effectively due to other tasks assigned to the Internal Audit Team. Even in the surprise inspection by the Special Monitoring Team of the Ministry, the matter of audit of the large number of pending objections and components is brought to the direction of the concerned office heads as well as the District Collector and Divisional Commissioner. The audit objections regarding the non-effectiveness of internal audit by the Accountant General's office are taken up in the inspection of the Collector's offices. Further, the Annual Report of the Accountant General's Office submitted to the Maharashtra Legislature for the year 2003, 2018 and 2019 mentions the lack of effective and effective internal audit and consequently the same errors/ deficiencies are being repeated. Therefore, the issue of circular for effective internal audit was under consideration of the Government so that the internal audit could be effective so that all the amounts due to the Government are credited to the Government accounts duly following the fiscal propriety as laid down in the Bombay Financial Rules 1959. Also, financial irregularities in the department will be prevented. Therefore, the following instructions are being issued from the government level to ensure the effective functioning of the Internal Audit Team (Deposit and Expenditure) of the Department.

However, the internal audit team at the divisional commissioner's office will have to take the approval of the divisional commissioner for their annual visit.
