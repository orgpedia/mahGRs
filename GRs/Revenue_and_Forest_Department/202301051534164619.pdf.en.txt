Date: 30th of December, 2022.
The Proposal:
There are incidents of damage to mango, cashew, betel nut, coconut, jackfruit etc. fruit trees and bamboo and flower trees like pigeon pea, phulora, palvi etc. by wild animals in the state and at present there is no mechanism to fix compensation in such cases.
However, if this methodology is to be developed, it is necessary to firstly work out the modalities for assessment of the loss of fruit trees on the basis of factors such as the wildlife responsible for such loss cases, the area affected by the loss as well as the extent of damage caused to the fruit trees, the flowering, the foliage, the extent of damage caused by the wild animals, etc.
Accordingly, the government is considering the formation of a committee to discuss with the local public funds and determine the procedures according to their guidance.
Government's decision:
To determine the mechanism for assessment of damage caused by wild animals such as mango, cashew, betel nut, coconut, jackfruit etc. and bamboo and flower plants, flowers, flowers, palvi etc. on the basis of the area affected by the damage and the extent of damage etc. and to suggest preventive measures to prevent such damage. The committee is being constituted under the chairmanship of Principal Secretary (Forest), Revenue and Forest Department.
