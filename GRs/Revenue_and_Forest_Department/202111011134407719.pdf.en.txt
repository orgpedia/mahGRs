The Maharashtra Minor Mineral Exploration (Development and Regulation) Rules, 2013. The Maharashtra Minor Mineral Exploration (Development and Regulation) (Amendment) Rules, 2015. 11/05/2015
In exercise of the powers conferred by section 15 (1) (3) of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 (67 of 1957), the Government of Maharashtra hereby amend the Maharashtra Minor Mineral Exploration (Development and Regulation) (Amendment) Rules, 2015 and in the English and Marathi versions of the said Amendment, in the Second proviso to sub-rule (1), in English and Marathi respectively, provide as under: Provided further that, no royalty shall be required to be paid on earth which is extracted while developing a plot of land utilised on the very same plot for land levelling or any work in the process of development of such plot.
The word' EARTH' has been used in the English notification of this notification.
Also, the version translated into Marathi only mentions the word' soil'. Therefore, at the regional level, where the notification in English version is used, all minor minerals of soil, stone, acacia etc. are exempted from ownership, and where the notification in Marathi translation is used, only the minor mineral soil is exempted from ownership and the ownership of other minor minerals, excluding soil, is recovered.
In a review meeting of the Divisional Commissioners of the state, the government has come to the notice that due to the use of different words in the English and Marathi language in the notification, the action is being taken differently from the regional level.

Government Circular No.:- Gaukhani 10/1012/ PR No. 603/ B
Accordingly, after taking the opinion of the Department of Law and Justice, the Department of Law and Justice has given the opinion that the word' EARTH' includes all minor minerals like soil, acne, stone. It has also been opined that while interpreting the provisions in English and Marathi, the interpretation of the provision in English should be considered.
Similarly, Ma. A petition was filed in the Bombay High Court. 12206/2018. In the order dated 22/01/2020, it has been stated that the second proviso to section 46 of the Maharashtra Minor Mineral Exploration (Development and Regulation) Rules, 2013, covers minor minerals like clay, sand, stone etc. Accordingly, the use of the word in English and Marathi was under the consideration of the government to issue clarificatory directions to avoid different types of proceedings regarding minor minerals used in the development of the plot at the regional level.
Government Circular: As amended under the Maharashtra Minor Mineral Exploration (Development and Regulation) (Amendment) Rules, 2015, in the English and Marathi version of this amendment, in the second proviso to sub-rule (1) of the principal rule-46, the following clarificatory directions are being given regarding the levy of proprietary interest while developing a plot of land: 1) During the development of a plot, all types of minor minerals such as soil, acne, stone etc. shall be extracted and the minor mineral shall be used for the levelling of the same plot or it shall be used for any work in the process of development of such plot, at that time such minor mineral shall not be liable to levy proprietary interest.
(3) This Agreement shall come into force on the date of its entry into force.
