Preamble: As the population of some of the taluks in most of the districts of the State has increased substantially, proposals for bifurcation of such taluks are continuously being received by the Government. The regional structure is determined by considering the criteria set by the committee in accordance with the formula of 100 points set by the Kapoor Committee in 1975 for Talathi Sazha. However, a long time has passed since the criteria were fixed and the cabinet has approved the computerization of various services in the revenue department, the change in information technology, as well as the recently established or proposed additional tehsildar offices and new talathi samajes, mandal offices in some taluks of the state. Therefore, while dividing the taluka, the improvement in information and technology over time and the computerization of revenue services were all taken into consideration and accordingly the matter of revising the criteria for dividing the taluka was under the consideration of the government.
