Also, Revenue and Forest Department Notification No. Gokhani / 0321 / Q. No.109 / B-2, D. Under the 02.03.2022, "Provided that the Divisional Commissioner may, if deemed necessary, permit the excavation and transportation of minor minerals during the night for the purposes of such infrastructure or water resources project of the Central or State Government." "It is provided for.
It will be mandatory to excavate sand / sand from the river / basin from 06.00 in the morning to 06.00 in the evening. Excavation and transportation of the baby through the river / backwaters will be prohibited after 06.00 evening. The Sand / Sand Export Policy-2025 provides that the e-tp license issued for the sale of Mahakunj online WAST sand will not be generated after 6: 00 pm. Other than sand, gunny bags can be transported 24 hours a day.
However, sand traffic is prohibited in some cities due to the high volume of vehicular traffic during the day. In many places, the demand for sand has increased to complete the works of various projects within the stipulated time. Also, since there are sand dunes after 06.00 in the evening, the vehicles available are not well stocked. Also, sand coming into the state from other states is allowed to be transported 24 hours with a zero royalty pass. However, due to the ban on sand transportation in the state from 06.00 in the evening to 06.00 in the morning, the sand in the state is not used to its fullest extent. Therefore, the government was considering allowing the transportation of sand excavated during the day for 24 hours.
Government Decision: - The following guidelines are being issued regarding MARAT excavation and transportation: - 1) It will be mandatory to excavate sand within this period from 06.00 in the morning to 06.00 in the evening. Excavations carried out during other than this period should be treated as illegal and dealt with as per rules.
