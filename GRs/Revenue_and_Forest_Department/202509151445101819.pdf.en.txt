2) Revenue B Forest Department, Memorandum No. LBL- 2502/114874 Q. No.141 / J-2, D. 10.08.2004 3) Revenue & Forest Department, Memorandum No. LBL-2505 / P.No.348 / J-2, D. 06.10.2006.
The Proposal: -
Demands have been received from time to time to approve the installation of billboards on vacant government land in major cities of the state. There is currently no specific policy for the entire state regarding the number of permits to be imposed while permitting the installation of billboards on vacant government land in the state. Given the importance that advertising has gained in modern times and the increasing prevalence of advertising in rural areas, including urban areas other than municipal corporations, there has been a need to have a policy on permitting and levying SHAH on government land in other parts of the state, such as the city of Mumbai and the Mumbai suburban district. Considering all these factors, making open government land available for billboards in other parts of the state like Mumbai will increase the revenue of the state and this policy will also help in job creation in the state. Therefore, the government was considering a comprehensive policy to allow the installation of billboards on government land throughout the state and to levy a licence fee for the same.
The Government's Decisions:
Government Decision No. LBL- 2586/1723629 Q. No.200 / C-8, D. Under the 03.02.1988 policy, the city of Mumbai has been set up to charge a licence fee for the installation of billboards on government land. Accordingly, in addition to the powers conferred under Section-40 of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, 1966 and the Maharashtra Revenue (Disposal of Government Lands), Rules-34, 36, 41, 48, 49, 50 and other ancillary provisions of the Maharashtra Revenue Rules, 1971, all previous Government decisions / Government Circulars permitting or permitting the installation of billboards on open government land throughout the State are being amended to lay down the following comprehensive policy.
