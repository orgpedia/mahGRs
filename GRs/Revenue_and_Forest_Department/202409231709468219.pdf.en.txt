has been taken.
In the impugned judgment, the Division Bench adverted to the Maharashtra Deputy Collectors (Recruitment, Fixation of Seniority and Confirmation) Rules, 1977 (for short, the "Rules") and noted that the promotions were given promotion only on temporary basis and such promotions were made subject to the approval of the Maharashtra Public Service Commission. The High Court also accounted for the quota available for the promotions and noted that the promotion was way beyond the earmarked quota for the promotions, provided under the rules. Admittedly, the approval of the Public Service Commission was never obtained for regularising the promotion. The Division Bench also found that the promotion of the promotions were made de horses the procedure prescribed in the rules and it was made hastily.
5. In the seniority dispute, the High Court clearly noticed the illegal mode of entry for the promotees. Also, vacancies were not available for their legitimate entry into the cadre. Moreover, there was no concurrence of the Public Service Commission.
The promotions were in excess of the quota provided for the promotees.
6. The petitioner has raised the contention that inter-se seniority should be determined on the basis of continuous length of service as provided under Rule 13(5) of the Rules. This might be acceptable only if induction into the cadre was made in accordance with the Rules. The temporary promotion as can be seen was 3 hurriedly made just before the direct recruits were inducted into the cadre. Due process as envisaged by the Rules was not followed for making the promotion. This was a fortuitous promotion which does not confer seniority right, only by virtue of service. The promotions were never approved by the MPSC. Moreover, the order itself reflected that the promotees can have no seniority claim by such fortuitous promotion.
7. Having considered the above and the other reasonings of the Division Bench in the impugned judgment, the Special Leave Petition is found devoid of merit. The same is accordingly dismissed. But the State is bound down to their assurance to not to revert back the concerned promotees despite the irregularities in their promotion de-hors the Rules, notwithstanding the present order in the SLP.
3. Dates for the period 2004 to 2006 of the Sub-Collector's cadre.

Following objections / objections have been received.

4. Following are the objections / objections received in respect of the aforesaid Temporary Service Seniority List.
Direct Service / Promotion Quota and Cadre No. The Supreme Court, New Delhi in Special Leave Petition No. In 19870/2024. The Supreme Court in its Judgment dated 02.09.2024. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ a. 9 590 Dispute, the High Court clearly noticed the illegal mode of entry for the promotes. Also, vacancies were not available for their legitimate entry into the cadre. Moreover, there was no concurrence of the Public Service Commission. The promotions were in excess of the quota provided for the promotions. "AY Bea has passed.
Therefore, on the decision taken by Jhasna regarding the imposition of quota to the sub-collector cadre, Md. The Supreme Court has upheld it. Accordingly, a quota system has been adopted while preparing / finalizing this list.
Date of regular service: - Ma. The Supreme Court of India, Special Leave Petition No. In 19870/2024. The Supreme Court, in its judgment dated 02.09.2024, held that "5 the
Impugned judgment, the Division Bench adverted to the Maharashtra Deputy Collectors (Recruitment, Fixation of Seniority and Confirmation) Rules, 1977 (for short, the "Rules") and noted that the promotions were given promotion only on temporary basis and such promotions were made subject to the approval of the Maharashtra Public Service Commission. The High Court also accounted for the quota available for the promotions and noted that the promotion was way beyond the earmarked quota for the promotions, provided under the rules. Admittedly, the approval of the Public Service Commission was never obtained for regularising the promotion. The Division Bench also found that the promotion of the promotions were made de horses the procedure prescribed in the rules and it was made hastily. "Orders have been passed.
For this reason, Ma. The High Court and M. Since the Supreme Court order clarifies the quota applicable to the sub-collector cadre, the posts are also available in the service seniority list for the years 2004 to 2006 as per the selection list for that year.
If not, the date of the vacancies from the posts falling in that category by determining the services rendered in that cadre as non-service, the vacancies available as per the prescribed quota in that year.
A regular date of service seniority has been given in consideration.

Provisional promotion from Tehsildar cadre to Deputy Collector cadre under rule 10 by acting in accordance with rule 9 (7) in Rule 12 of the Sub-Divisional Entry into Service Rules, 1977.
The officers of the Sub-Collector cadre given the post after 3 years of service.
A provision for review (29595) has been made for eligibility / disqualification. As it does not appear that the provisionally promoted officers of the Deputy Collector cadre in the seniority list published on the current date 31.12.2020 have been reviewed as per rule 12, but the officers have been given the benefits of the assured progress scheme / senior position, promotion to the post of Deputy Collector (Selection Category) / promotion to the post of Additional Collector.
And since the officer has been given the benefit / promotion of a senior position, it has been consciously decided that these provisionally promoted Deputy District Collectors continue to be promoted in the Sub-District cadre assuming that they have been reviewed as per Rule 12.

The slogan "Avid Seva" was displayed in front of his name. Following that, Ma. In an order passed by the Maharashtra Administrative Tribunal dated 26.08.2022, 054 | 7 / 9
We deem it appropriate to direct the respondent no. 1 to delete the remark 'fortuitous service' against the names of the Deputy Collectors, whose names are included in the seniority list from sr.nos.582 to 700.
On behalf of the Government against the said order of the Hon'ble Tribunal, Mr. The High Court, Bombay Bench at Aurangabad in Writ Petition No. 11692/2022 (Government of Maharashtra & Others v. Mr. Shivaji)
Shieds and others) and Writ Petition No. 11762/2022 (Government of Maharashtra and Others v. Sriman Samiksha Chandrakar et al.) was filed. In response to these petitions, Shri. The High Court has passed the final order dated 08.08.2024 and in this order, Paragraph No. The following orders have been passed in 112.
112. Consequentially, when the challenge posed by the four Applicants had been rejected, the Tribunal could not have travelled beyond their prayers. Since we have concluded that both the Transfer Applications of these four Applicants deserve to be rejected, the suggestions put forth by the Tribunal below paragraph No.87 and the consequential order below paragraph No.88, deserve to be quashed. There was no reason, in our view, for the learned Tribunal to make suggestions when the impugned seniority list was not to be interfered with or set aside.
For this reason, Ma. The High Court and M. As the Supreme Court upheld the Department's decision regarding the applicability of quota to the sub-collector cadre, the vacancies available in the service seniority list from 2004 to 2006 were as per the prescribed quota in that year.
In view of the regular date of service seniority and the availability of posts as per the selection list for that year.
Unless done otherwise, the services rendered in that cadre are designated "Absent Services" and the officer's name is marked "Absent Services."
The Admission to Service of the Sub-Divisional Magistrate Class Rules, 1977, while finalising the said seniority.
Sample-2 prescribed under Rule 14 and Sample prescribed under Government Decision dated 21.10.2011 of the General Administration Department have both been taken into consideration.
Other incidental issues arising out of the objections received regarding the service merit list of the sub-collector category, e.g. Changes in name, corrections in date of birth, category, etc. These service records have been checked and correlated changes have been made as required.
