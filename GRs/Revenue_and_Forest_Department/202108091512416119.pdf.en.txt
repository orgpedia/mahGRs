Introduction: The extended area of Shirol Municipal Council has not been mapped due to the absence of town geodesy.
As the city geodesy has not been done, the extent and area of the plots in the extended area has not been determined, so the city geodesy of the extended area of the Shirol Municipal Council is required to be done.

Accordingly, the matter of preparing the map of the plot and the ownership document by giving the Town Geo-Evaluation and Town Geo-Evaluation Number of the extended area of the Shirol Municipal Council was under the consideration of the government. The government has taken the following steps in this regard:
