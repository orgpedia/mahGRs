The agricultural census is carried out every five years in all the states by the central government. The first agricultural census was conducted in 1970-71. Agricultural census is broadly a part of the scheme of collecting statistical information/ data on agriculture in the country. This information includes all current account holders in the country. The basic information of agricultural statistics is collected in the agricultural census by keeping the micro level statistical component of the drawee account holder for agricultural decisions. Agricultural census helps in developmental planning, social, economic policy making and national priorities. Agricultural census is the basis for determining the overall integrated national agricultural statistical system and is one of the pillars of the national statistical plan. This data is collected at different administrative levels like village, tehsil, district, state and across India.
Ten Agriculture Censuses have been completed so far and instructions have been received from the Central Government under the letter dated 15 th February, 2022 for conducting the Eleventh Agriculture Census in the State during the reference year 2021-22 from 01 st July, 2021 to 30 th June, 2022. In this enumeration, the computerized land record records of the state will be available in advance in the Agri Census 2021-22 app developed by the Central Government. This will reduce the scope of work compared to the previous agricultural census and will help in faster and accurate data collection. Detailed guidelines to the field machinery were under consideration.
Government Circular: The following guidelines are being issued for the agricultural census in the state.
The agricultural census is carried out in three stages. Statistically, the three stages are interdependent and provide information on various aspects of agricultural census.

Second stage- Specific details of the tenant account holders like crop structure, cropping pattern, different types of irrigation equipment, classification of area according to land use etc. are collected from selected villages.
This information is collected from 20 percent of the selected villages and the account holders in each taluka.
Third phase- In the third phase, the status of agricultural input consumption of the depositors is collected from 7 percent selected villages of each taluka.
(9) New initiatives in Agriculture Census 2021-22: As a new initiative in the 11th Agriculture Census, the use of computerized land records, collection of information through App/ Software, different reference period for each phase, etc. For this, the Central Government has developed an app/ software named Agri 21-22 (Phase 1) using the information of the computerized land records of the state for the agricultural census reference year 20 21-22.
(2) Method of collection of information/ data: 2.1 The data of the number of owners/ working account holders and area under tenancy as per the different size, social group, gender, type of account holders and tenancy status of the account holders in all the villages of the state will be collected and compiled after complete enumeration.
2.2 The data collection work on the basis of comprehensive land records will be prepared in the prescribed form using the Agri Census 2021-22 App based on the computerized land records data of the state and the remaining information is to be updated in this app based on the local knowledge of the field staff or through necessary local inquiries. The data should include all the survey numbers/ group numbers of each village and based on this, a list/ list of the current account holders should be prepared. As the land records have been computerized in the state of Maharashtra, the facility of completing the agricultural census through app/ software has become available. It should be ensured that the computerized land records of the area are updated before starting the work.
(iii) Training and Field Work: 3.1 The staff engaged in the primary work of agricultural enumeration as well as supervisory officers need to be given detailed training before the actual field work begins. The training of agricultural enumeration staff and officers should be organized at the district/ taluka level. Accordingly, training should be imparted to the officers/ staff at the taluk level.
Taluk level officers will impart training to Talathis and Mandal officers.

(https:// census. gov. in/) It should be used during the training conducted for field staff before the field work of agricultural census is actually undertaken. A guidebook of agricultural census in Marathi has been prepared and it is being made available at the regional level in online and offline format. Students should read the instructions carefully. This will make it easier for them to understand the terminology, definition and process of agricultural calculation. Also, doubts can be raised about the unexplained part of the guidelines. Based on the guidelines of the central government, detailed training should be given to the field staff after considering all the issues thoroughly.
The training should also provide detailed guidance on preparation of list of drawee account holders, type of drawee account (individual, joint and institutional accounts), consolidation of dispersed drawee area of drawee account holders, concepts and definitions for agricultural census, filling up of forms 1 to 7 in the app, etc.
4.1 Since the work of collecting information about the account holders of the entire village will be done using Android and web applications, all the talathis and mandals should be allotted villages with the help of agricultural officers by the concerned Tahsildar to complete the work according to the schedule and quality. In the State of Maharashtra, the computerized land records will be available in the app and then the field staff will have to update the rest of the information through their own knowledge or by asking the local level as per the requirement or by confirming it themselves.
4.2 The Talathi will submit the information compiled in the app/ software with the help of the Agriculture Assistant to the Board officials for scrutiny. Thereafter, the Circle Officers shall thoroughly scrutinize the data collected at the village level and if found satisfactory, agree for further processing/ action.

This cycle of data correction will continue until all the submitted data is error-free for further processing/ processing.
4.3 Thereafter, the prescribed charts of agricultural enumeration at village/ tehsil/ district/ state/ country level will be prepared through the software. Regional meetings of the states will be held to finalise the report in a time-bound manner. After the finalization of the information, the information will be disseminated through the portal and the information of the transacting account holders of Phase 1 will also be used for country level reporting.
