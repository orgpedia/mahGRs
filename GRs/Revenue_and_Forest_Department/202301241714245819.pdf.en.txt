The proposal for development of Computing System and disbursement of funds has been approved by the Departmental Project Implementation Committee in its meeting held on 04.11.2022. The government was considering a revised procedure to identify eligible farmers through Aadhaar number and credit the amount directly into their bank accounts.
Government's decision:
The Government is approving to disburse the relief amount to the eligible farmers who have suffered loss of crops and agricultural land in natural calamities, without further disbursement as per the prevailing procedure, on the computer system to be developed by MAHA IT as per the general procedure as follows.

The lists of beneficiaries made available by the Tehsildar on the computer system shall be approved by the concerned Provincial Officer or Resident Deputy Collector as authorized by the Collector. These lists will be approved within the limits of the district-wise funds sanctioned by the government for this purpose.
(2) The information provided by the Tahsildar shall be processed on a computer system. errors (e.g. Information such as duplication of beneficiaries, Aadhaar number being incorrect, etc.) will be displayed on the computer system to the Tehsildar to eliminate errors. This will prevent the payment of money to two persons in the name of the same person or to two persons for the same affected area. The Tahsildar can make necessary corrections in this information and this information can be uploaded again on the computer system. The Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Tehsildars and Provincial Officers or Resident Deputy Collectors will be made available on the website.
(3) Based on the information processed in this manner, a unique number list (VK List) showing the details of the beneficiaries such as name, affected area, amount of assistance, etc. will be generated on the computer system. The list can be downloaded from the website. This list will also be available gram panchayat-wise and will be publicly published in every gram panchayat. The concerned Talathi/ Gram Sevak will guide the farmers to read this particular number list.
