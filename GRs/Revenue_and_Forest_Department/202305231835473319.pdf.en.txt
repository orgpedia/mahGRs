Maharashtra Act No. 30 of 2017, dated 15/04/2017 2. Government Circular No. NAA-2017/ PR No. 115/ T-1, dated 19/08/2017 3. Maharashtra Act No. 12 of 2018, dated 17/01/2018 4. No.142/ T-1, dated 14/03/2018 5. Govt. No.118/ J-1A, dated 13/04/2022
The proposal-
Under Section 42 of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, 1966, prior permission of the Collector is required for any land used for agriculture for any non-agricultural purpose or for use from one non-agricultural purpose to another. Permission to modify the use of land situated in the area included in the draft or final development plan.
Non-requirement, provision for human conversion of land use for land included in the final development plan area as well as in the draft or final regional plan, and land use norms for residential purposes of land included in the peripheral area within 200 meters from the village boundary.
The provisions of conversion have been amended in this regard under section-42 (a), (b), (c) and (d) respectively and the procedure has been prescribed. Section 44A of the Code provides that no permission is required to alter the use of land for genuine industrial purposes. Under these provisions, landholders are required to obtain a certificate of non-human agricultural use, besides separately obtaining a construction/ development permit under the provisions of the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966. Citizens have to apply to two authorities for construction and complete the documents. The opinion of the Assistant Director, Town Planning has to be taken while taking both the permissions. Therefore, it is necessary to combine them.
An online system called" Building Plan Management System" (BPMS) is being used for issuing such construction/ development permissions.

The issue of issuing permits/ non-agricultural use certificates, construction/ development permits and other services online and in combination was under the consideration of the government.
The Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966 provides that when a building permit or drawing permission is granted by a competent authority on a land, it is ensured that the use of the proposed non-agricultural purpose in such land is permissible. That is, since no separate non-agricultural permission is required for such lands under Section 42-A, 42-B, 42-A, 42-D or 44-A of the Maharashtra Land Code, 1966, or since the lands are deemed to have been converted into non-agricultural use, the concerned landholder/ plot holder/ developer is not required to obtain separate non-agricultural permission if the construction permission is granted by the competent authority in respect of such lands.
If the land is owned by a Class-I tenant, the conversion tax will be collected in the Building Plan Management System (BPMS) system and a non-agricultural use certificate will be issued along with the development permit. If the land is of Class-II tenancy, the amount of Nijarana or overage and payment of other government amounts etc. should be considered and on payment of such amounts, it will be mandatory to grant development permission through the Building Plan Management System (BPMS) system after being certified by the competent revenue officer and in such cases also the non-agricultural use certificate as mentioned above will be issued along. The certificate will be system generated and in all such cases, a copy of the certificate will be electronically sent to the village office for registration and it will be mandatory for the permit holder to pay regular non-agricultural dues.
This should be noted by all the concerned government departments/ financial institutions etc.
