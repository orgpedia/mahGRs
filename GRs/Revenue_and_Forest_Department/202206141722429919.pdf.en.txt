Preamble: Provisions have been made regarding allotment of alternative land to eligible project victims under irrigation projects in the state under various government decisions as well as the Rehabilitation Act. Under this provision, alternative land has been allocated to most of the project victims in the state. However, the process of allotment of alternative land to some eligible project victims is still pending. In the meeting held on 05.04.2022, instructions have been given to work out the modalities for allotment of alternative land to the project victims. Accordingly, it was under the consideration of the Government to determine the priority/ modalities while allotting alternative land to eligible project victims.
Government Decision: The District Collector concerned should immediately take action to publish the land pool for the allotment of alternative land to the project victims in the irrigation projects in the state. Accordingly, after receiving the application from the eligible project victims to get alternative land in the concerned collector's office, the eligibility and payment area of the applicants will be verified by the district collector's office under which the affected area of the applicants falls. Accordingly, the modalities for allotment of alternative land from the land pool for rehabilitation of project victims are being worked out as follows.
I) The alternative land in the land reserve for rehabilitation of the project victims of irrigation projects in the state will be allocated in the following manner. Also, no land which is not included in the land pool for rehabilitation can be allotted to any project victims by any authority. Any land required/ proposed for rehabilitation will be included in the rehabilitation land pool first and then the process of land allotment will be carried out in the following manner.
(ii) On receipt of applications from the project victims for the land in the land pool for rehabilitation, the process of allotment of alternative land will be carried out as per the following procedure.
(9) If the project victim is a project victim of a project which has its own benefit area and land is available for allotment in that benefit area, then, a) if the project victim has applied for available land in the benefit area as per the rehabilitation plan of their respective project (i.e. if the project victim is in the notified submergence area for the land in the benefit area demanded as per the planned rehabilitation plan of the original project), then alternative land shall be allotted to them immediately.
