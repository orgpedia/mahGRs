The proposal: The Bombay High Court has issued a writ petition No. 3551/2021 and other petitions.
The High Court. In respect of difficulties arising out of determination of compensation for land acquired for National Highways in accordance with the directions issued on 21.10.2022
Guidelines issued regarding action to be taken by the competent authority and Land Acquisition Officer under section 3H (3), 3H (4) of the National Highways Act, 1955
The matter is under consideration of the government. The matter of issuing interim guidelines before issuing final guidelines in the above matter was under consideration of the Government. The important reason for this is that various court cases are likely to arise unnecessarily in the interim while the final guidelines are being prepared. Therefore, before issuing the final guidelines, the interim guidelines mentioned below are being issued to all concerned. The government has issued guidelines for this.
Circular to the Government: Section 3H (3), 3H (4) of the National Highways Act, 1955, regarding difficulties arising out of determination of compensation for land to be acquired for National Highways

3. In the meanwhile, the Competent Authority cannot act upon such determination and distribute the amount in accordance with the same. If within the period of four weeks of the receipt of intimation, referred to hereinabove, either all the claimants accept such determination or do not communicate in writing, after obtaining in writing the acknowledgment in that regard, of their dispute and/or disagreement of such determination, the Competent Authority ought to make payment in accordance with the same.
4. Whereas, if an objection and/or dispute is raised in respect of such determination by any of the claimants, within four weeks of the date of receipt of such intimation, the Competent Authority will have to refer it to the competent Civil Court in terms of sub section (4) of Section 3H of the Act.
5. The Competent Authority will have to give adequate time of at least four weeks to the claimants, either for agreeing with such determination or for disputing with the same.
