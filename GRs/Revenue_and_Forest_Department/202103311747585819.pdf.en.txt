Mantralaya, Mumbai- 400 032
Date: 31st of March 2021
Introduction: In the 16th meeting of the State Board for Wildlife, it has been proposed to declare the State Snake and State Sparrow as the State Nature Symbols among the additional issues raised by the members of the Board. Accordingly, the importance of the species to be declared as State Nature Mark in human life or ecosystem, the status of the species as threatened as per national/ international recognition, the possibility of extinction, the need for public awareness in that regard, the territoriality, the number, future threats, etc. have to be considered. Also, it is necessary to comprehensively consider the maximum number of nature symbols of the state so that the importance of nature symbols of the state remains intact.
The proposal to declare the State Snake and State Sparrow was under the consideration of the Government to form a comprehensive committee to examine the matter of declaring the animal as the State's Nature Mark and to decide the number of State's Mark and the criteria for declaring it.
Government Decision: In order to decide the criteria for declaring the State's Nature Mark, a committee is being formed by including experienced and expert persons from various disciplines of biodiversity, experts from the Zoological Survey of India, experts in entomology and botany, senior forest officials, etc.
