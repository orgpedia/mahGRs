The proposal-
As most of the districts in the state received below average rainfall during Kharif 2018, the government has declared drought in 151 talukas in 26 districts of the state under the Namud Sarkar decision.
As the drought situation in the state is likely to create serious issues regarding the availability of fodder and water for the livestock in the area in the near future, the measures to be taken to overcome the problem of fodder for the animals in the drought-affected areas. In the meeting of the Cabinet Sub-Committee held on January 3, 2019, interested farmers should be appealed to keep their animals by starting fodder camps in the cow protection institutions running in the state. Accordingly, if the willing farmers keep their animals in such cow protection institutions, such institutions should be given subsidy as per the rates prescribed under the SDRF as per the prevailing rules.
