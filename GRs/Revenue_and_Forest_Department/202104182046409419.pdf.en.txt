ORDER
Break The Chain
SOP for Long Distance Trains
In exercise of the powers conferred under Section 2 of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 and the powers, conferred under The Disaster Management Act, 2005, the undersigned, in his capacity as Chairperson, State Executive Committee, hereby issues the following directions, that will remain in force throughout the state of Maharashtra from the date of this order till the time it is retracted or till
COVID 19 stays notified as a disaster -
A. Standard Operating Procedure for travel to Maharashtra through Railways:
COVID APPROPRIATE BEHAVIOUR will form an essential part of all train travel from/ into/ within the State (except for local trains). It will be the joint responsibility of the Railway authorities and the local Disaster Management Authority to ensure the same. This will include without exception following.
a. All passengers to compulsorily wear masks in a proper fashion throughout the journey and at the railway stations.
b. All passengers to maintain proper social distancing while boarding/ alighting from the trains or when getting tested/ checked at the stations when needed.
c. Thermal scanners to be made available at entry/exit points at all stations.
d. Passengers to be advised to arrive at the Station well before time of train departure as to ensure no crowding for thermal scanning at the entry points.
e. e-ticketing/mobile ticketing should be promoted as it becomes easier to do the tracing of close contacts through mobile numbers. Fine system should also ideally be mobile based or allow e-collection.
B. Sensitive Origins:
Due to reasons that may lead to higher potentiality of spread of Corona 19 in State of Maharashtra, some
origins may be declared as sensitive origins by the MSDMA. For the trains that may be bringing in passengers
from these origin, the following protocol is to be followed in addition to protocol mentioned in A above:
1. Railways shall share data of the trains that are scheduled to be running between these origins and stations of Maharashtra with local Disaster Management Authority (DMA).

travel.
4. All passengers shall be compulsorily screened and only asymptomatic passengers shall be allowed to board the trains for Maharashtra. Social distancing should be ensured during boarding / de-boarding and travel.
5. Railways shall share the data with the local DMA of the passengers that are travelling on the said trains and who are scheduled to disembark at various stations of Maharashtra on each day at the earliest, at least 4 hours prior to departure from the origin.
6. Though data should contain information about all the passengers that may disembark at any station of
Maharashtra, it is, however, appreciated that in some cases, this data may not be completely available and thus local authorities should plan for 10% more than the expected dis-embarkment.
7. Railway authorities and local DMA should maintain a close coordination to exchange information about delays or schedule changes of trains and about number of passengers dis-embarking.
8. Railway authorities should announce on each station en-route, about the systems that have been put in place so that each passenger gets informed about the rules to follow. Railway authorities may also plan printing pamphlets in Hindi/ Marathi (bi-lingual) to be distributed to all the passengers informing them of Covid Appropriate Behaviour expected and dangers to themselves and their family members if they fail to do so. These should also carry information on fines, protocols at the destination etc.
9. To the extent possible, railway authorities should ensure that trains from these origins come to outer platforms where it may be easier to do thermal and other checking without affecting passengers from other origins and without mixing the two. Also, wherever possible, all passengers alighting from the said trains to be guided towards a single exit.
After dis-embarkation following must be followed: 1. All the passengers will be queued up with social distancing for screening by the DMA/ Health.

4. Every passenger with positive result of test or with symptoms or refusing to undergo screening as decided above by DMA shall necessarily be moved to quarantine centres by DMA. If a passenger however wants to move to a hospital of choice which has bed available, DMA may allow the same.
5. All passengers without symptoms and without needing to be moved to quarantine centres by DMA, without fail shall be stamped on their hands for compulsory home quarantine for 15 days.
This is required for those passengers also who are carrying negative RT-PCR test as well as who have tested negative in RAT at the station or otherwise.
6. Any person with a quarantined stamp found outside home except for medical emergency within the period of 15 days of stamping shall be fined with Rs. 1000/- and shall be moved to institutional
quarantine.
11. Local DMA should plan, along with local MSRTC/ local public bus transport officers about the buses that may ply to take these passengers for onward journey. It will be desirable that most of the person coming out of the station go through planned MSRTC / local public bus transport buses smoothly and come in least contact with other citizens. MSRTC / local public bus transport should plan routes that may cover most of the passengers or if possible have flexible routes.
12. Railways should decide on extra precaution to be taken by their employees while serving trains from these origins.
13. Covid Appropriate Behaviour in the trains we well as the stations must be enforced rigorously.
14. Currently not all exits have thermal scanners. It is expected that Railways will establish these at the earliest.
15. Concerned publicity department of the origin state must be informed of our decision to put the origin on sensitive list so they can publicise the decision and ready the passengers for requirements of boarding. They should be requested to publicise the advisory that travellers to Maharashtra should go for RT-PCR test within 48 hours of travel.
16. As trains are on the move for long times before they reach destination and also passengers are seated in an orderly fashion, Railways may think of using this time of travel to conduct some tests or carry some operations that reduces time required for protocols at the station after dis-embarkment.
17. Railway shall appoint nodal officer for the state level as well as various DMA level who shall be responsible for coordinating with SDMA and DMA for the purposes of these guidelines. SDMA and DMA shall ensure that all that is needed to be done to achieve the objectives of these guidelines is executed and may incur expenditure for the same as per the guidelines of expenditure on Covid 19
disaster management.
