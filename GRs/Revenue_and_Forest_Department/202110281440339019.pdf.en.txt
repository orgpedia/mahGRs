As per the Drought Management Code, 2016, a detailed methodology has been prescribed under the Contextual Government Decision, No. 1 and 2 for assessing the drought situation in the State. The second wave of drought has been imposed in 8 talukas of the state based on the situation in the Kharif 2021 season as per the criteria prescribed in the Reference Government Decision and the Drought Management Code. There is no question of declaring drought in Ulhasnagar taluk as the sowing area in the 8 taluks where the second wave of drought has hit is negligible. Ground truthing survey has been done in the remaining 7 taluks and based on the proposal received from the State Level Drought Monitoring Committee, the matter of declaring drought in the taluks of the state was under consideration of the government.

Considering the factors such as rainfall deficit, available ground water, remote sensing parameters, vegetation index, soft moisture, area under sowing and crop condition for the period from June to September, the State Government is declaring moderate drought in Nandurbar taluk of Nandurbar district.
The following relaxations are being approved by the Government in Nandurbar taluka where drought is being declared:
