Preamble: As per the notifications issued under the Maharashtra Rehabilitation of Project Affected Persons Act, 1976, 1986 and 1999, restrictions have been imposed on transfer transactions by inserting the words" Reserved for Rehabilitation" in the records of other rights in the 7/12 th part of the slab eligible account holders in the benefit area of irrigation projects in the state. Therefore, the beneficiaries of these projects have been facing difficulties in buying and selling their lands, forging accounts and dividing them according to inheritance rights for many years.
Considering the requirement of lands in the benefit area for rehabilitation of project victims, it is not possible to allow lifting of restrictions on all slabable lands in the benefit area. Therefore, it is directed to frame a comprehensive policy on the demand of the beneficiaries to lift the restrictions on their slab area. the High Court had said. Accordingly, based on the technical report submitted by the Project Mechanism after ascertaining that the lands of the account holders in the benefit areas of the irrigation projects in the State do not have access to irrigation facilities and are not likely to have access to irrigation facilities in the future, the Government Decision No. RPA/ 2019/ PR.No.151/ R-1 dated 05.08.2019 has been laid down regarding" Reduction of shares reserved for resettlement and lifting of restrictions on land transfer transactions" in the Record of Other Rights in Land 7/12 of the land holders in the benefit areas. As per the decision of the government, a time limit has been set for processing the applications of the concerned. The High Court has given.
In the case of the slab eligible account holders/ land holders whose lands in the benefit areas of irrigation projects in the state are or are going to be provided irrigation facilities, but the acquisition of these lands has not been done so far, there is also a demand from the concerned account holders to reduce the shares registered in the other rights of 7/12 as" Reserved for Rehabilitation," and also to reduce the share of the beneficiaries of the irrigation projects. Several petitions were filed in the High Court. However, since the said lands are/ will be provided with irrigation facilities, it is not possible to proceed in such cases as per the Government decision dated 05.08.2019.
