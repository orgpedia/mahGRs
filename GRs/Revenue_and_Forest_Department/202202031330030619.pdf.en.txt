As per the provisions of Section 40 of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, 1966 and Rule 27 of the Maharashtra Land Revenue (Disposal of Government Land) Rules, 1971, the government land has been provided to the concerned agencies at concessional rates by way of possession or lease, taking into account the demand and criteria for providing government land for residential purposes of the cooperative housing societies. The policy in this regard was decided by the Government Decision dated 09/07/1999. Thereafter, all the Government decisions issued from time to time in this regard have been compiled and issued together under the Government Decision dated 25/05/2007. However, in many cases, the cooperative housing societies on the lands provided by the government appear to have granted membership to some persons without obtaining permission from the competent authority. Also, in some cases, it has been found that the person who got the membership in such a manner has died or the membership has been transferred to another person. In such a situation, according to what criteria the action to be taken in accordance with the rule of breach of condition, subject to reference No. 1 As per the Government decision dated 07/07/2010, directions have been issued to the Regional Revenue Agencies. However, the aforesaid guidelines did not include the number of times the organization has changed members/ unlicensed transfers due to the resignation of a member, hence, it was pointed out by the Regional Office that there are difficulties in complying with such terms and conditions. The matter was under consideration of the government.
