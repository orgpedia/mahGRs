The proposal submitted by the Collector, Satara vide letter dated 25/05/2022 included the village of Kahar.

Now that the villagers had identified a place for resettlement, the matter of including it in the government decision was under the consideration of the government in order to give administrative approval for the permanent resettlement of this village.
