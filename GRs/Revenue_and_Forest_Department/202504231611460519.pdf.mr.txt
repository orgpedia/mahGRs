Z1. Therefore, in the larger public interest, we are inclined to issue the following directions, in addition to the directives issued by this Court in Redirections in the matter of demolition of structures (supra):
(1) While issuing the building planning permission, an undertaking be obtained from the builder/applicant, as the case may be, to the effect that possession of the building will be entrusted and/or handed over ८० the owners/beneficiaries only after obtaining completion/occupation certificate from the authorities concerned.

(ii) The builder/developer/owner shall cause (८0 be
displayed at the construction site, a copy of the approved
plan during the entire period of construction and _ the
authorities concerned shall inspect the premises periodically
and maintain a record of such inspection in their official
records.
(7717) Upon conducting personal inspection and being
satisfied that the building is constructed in accordance with
the building planning permission given and there is no
deviation in such construction in any manner, the completion/occupation certificate in respect of residential
/ commercial building, be issued by the authority concerned
to the parties concerned, without causing undue delay. If any
deviation is noticed, action must be taken in accordance with
the Act and the process of issuance of completion/occupation
certificate should be deferred, unless and until the
deviations pointed out are completely rectified.
(iv) All the necessary service connections, such as,
Flectricity, water supply, sewerage connection, etc., shall
be given by the service provider/ Board to the buildings only
after the production of the completion/occupation
certificate.
(v) Even after issuance of completion certificate,
deviation/violation if any contrary to the planning
permission brought to the notice of the authority immediate
steps be taken by the said authority concerned, in accordance
with law, against the builder/owner/occupant; and _ the
official, who is responsible for issuance of wrongful
completion /occupation certificate shall be proceeded
departmentally forthwith.
(vi) No permission licence to conduct any business/trade
must be given by any authorities including local bodies of States Union Territories in any unauthorized building
irrespective of it being residential or commercial building.
(vil) The development must be in conformity with the zonal
plan and usage. Any modification to such zonal plan and usage
must be taken by strictly following the rules in place and in
consideration of the larger public interest and the impact on
the environment.
(५777) Whenever any request is made by the respective
authority under the planning department/local body for co-
operation from another department to take action against any
unauthorized construction, the latter shall render immediate

assistance and co-operation and any delay or dereliction would be viewed seriously. The States/UT must also take disciplinary
action against the erring officials once it is brought to
their knowledge.
(ix) In the event of any application / appeal / revision being filed by the owner or builder against the non-issuance
of completion certificate Or for regularisation of
unauthorised construction or rectification of deviation etc.,
the same shall be disposed of by the authority concerned,
including the pending appeals/revisions, as expeditiously as
possible, in any event not later than 90 days as statutorily
provided.
(x) If the authorities strictly adhere to the earlier
directions issued by this court and those being passed today,
they would have deterrent effect and the quantum of litigation
before the Tribunal Courts relating to house / building
constructions would come down drastically. Hence, necessary instructions should be issued by all the State/UT Governments
in the form of Circular to all concerned with a warning that
all directions must be scrupulously followed and failure to
do so will be viewed seriously, with departmental action being
initiated against the erring officials as per law.
(x1) Banks/financial institutions shall sanction loan
against any building as a security only after verifying the completion/occupation certificate issued to a building on
production of the same by the parties concerned.
(X11) The violation of any of the directions would lead to
initiation of contempt proceedings in addition to the prosecution
under the respective laws.

निर्देश पुढीलप्रमाणे :-
90. In order to allay the fears in the minds of the citizens
with regard to arbitrary exercise of power by the officers/officials of the State, we find it necessary to issue certain directions in exercise of our power under Article 142 of the Constitution. We are also of the view that even after orders
पृष्ठ ७ पैकी 3
# Page 4
शासन परिपत्रक क्रमांकः संकीर्ण-२ ०२५/प्र.क्र.१९/म-६
of demolition are passed, the affected party needs to be given
some time so as to challenge the order of demolition before an
appropriate forum. We are further of the view that even in cases
of persons who do not wish to contest the demolition order,
sufficient time needs to be given to them to vacate and arrange
their affairs. It is not a happy sight to see women, children and
aged persons dragged to the streets overnight. Heavens would not
fall on the authorities if they hold their hands for some period.
91. At the outset, we clarify that these directions will not
be applicable if there is an unauthorized structure in any public
place such as road, street, footpath, abutting railway line or
any river body or water bodies and also to cases where there is
an order for demolition made by a Court of law.
A. NOTICE
1. No demolition should be carried out without a prior show
cause notice returnable either in accordance with the time
provided by the local municipal laws or within 15 days' time
from the date of service of such notice, whichever is later.
ii. The notice shall be served upon the owner/occupier by a
registered post A.D. Additionally, the notice shall also be
affixed conspicuously on the outer portion of the structure
in question.
iii. The time of 15 days, stated herein above, shall start from
the date of receipt of the said notice.
iv. To prevent any allegation of backdating, we direct that as
soon as the show cause notice is duly served, intimation
thereof shall be sent to the office of Collector/District
Magistrate of the district digitally by email and an auto
generated reply acknowledging receipt of the mail should also
be issued from the office of the Collector/District
Magistrate. The Collector/DM shall designate a nodal officer
and also assign an email address and communicate the same to
all the municipal and other authorities in charge of building
regulations and demolition within one month from today.
v. The notice shall contain the details regarding:
a. the nature of the unauthorized construction.
b. the details of the specific violation and the grounds of
demolition.

शासन परिपत्रक क्रमांकः संकीर्ण-२ ०२५/प्र.क्र.१९/म-६
2. a list of documents that the notice is required to
furnish along with his reply.
d. The notice should also specify the date on which the
personal hearing is fixed and the designated authority
before whom the hearing will take place;
vi. Every municipal/local authority shall assign a designated
digital portal, within 3 months from today wherein details
regarding service/pasting of the notice, the reply, the
show cause notice and the order passed thereon would be
available.
B. PERSONAL HEARING
1. The designated authority shall give an opportunity of
personal hearing to the person
concerned.
17. The minutes of such a hearing shall also be recorded.
C. FINAL ORDER
1. Upon hearing, the designated authority shall pass a final
order.
1171. The final order shall contain:
a. the contentions of the noticee, and if the designated
authority disagrees with the same, the reasons
thereof;
b. as to whether the unauthorized construction is
compoundable, if it is not so, the reasons therefor;
c. if the designated authority finds that only part of
the construction is
unauthorized/non-compoundable, then the details
thereof.
d. as to why the extreme step of demolition is the
only option available and other options like
compounding and demolishing only part of the property
are not available.
D. AN OPPORTUNITY OF APPELLATE AND JUDICIAL SCRUTINY OF THE FINAL
ORDER.
1. We further direct that if the statute provides for an
appellate opportunity and time for filing the same, or even
if it does not so, the order will not be implemented for a
period of 15 days from the date of receipt thereof. The order
पृष्ठ ७ पैकी ५
# Page 6
शासन परिपत्रक क्रमांकः संकीर्ण-२ ०२५/प्र.क्र.१९/म-६
Shall also be displayed on the digital portal as stated
above.
ii. An opportunity should be given to the owner/occupier to
remove the unauthorized construction or demolish the same
within a period of 15 days. Only after the period of 15 days
from the date of receipt of the notice has expired and the
Owner/occupier has not removed/demolished the unauthorized
construction, and if the same is not stayed by any appellate authority or a court, the concerned authority shall take steps
to demolish the same. It is only such construction which is
found to be unauthorized and not compoundable shall be
demolished.

be prepared by the concerned authority signed by two Panchas.

the concerned authority shall prepare a demolition report giving the list of police officials and civil personnel that
participated in the demolition process. Video recording to be duly preserved.
17. The said demolition report should be forwarded to the
Municipal Commissioner by email and shall also be displayed
on the digital portal.
92. Needless to state that the authorities hereinafter shall
strictly comply with the aforesaid directions issued by us.
93. Tt will also be informed that violation of any of the
directions would lead to initiation of contempt proceedings in
addition to the prosecution.
94. The officials should also be informed that if the demolition
is found to be in violation of the orders of this Court, the
officer/officers concerned will be held responsible for
restitution of the demolished property at his/their personal cost
in addition to payment of damages.
