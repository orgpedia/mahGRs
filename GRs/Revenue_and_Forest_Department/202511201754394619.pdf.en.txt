Read: Government Decision Revenue & Forest Department No. Land-1094 / P.No.58 / J-1, Dated 03rd March, 2007
Introduction: The State Government has decided to provide land / grounds on lease for a limited period of time for the purpose of exhibitions, related functions (marriage and reception), entertainment programmes, religious functions, circuses, etc. The policy has been framed under the Government Decision dated 03rd March 2007.
However, wild beast games have been discontinued in Circassia due to legal issues. A lot of information about the animal world is available on Discovery Channel and SAAS Planet, etc. Currently, only the gymnastics and juggling games of the circus are left in the circus, and so the general public / children are not much attracted to the circus. The closure of circuses due to the COVID pandemic since 2019 has, in turn, put the future of circus-dependent artists and entrepreneurs in the industry at risk.
As the circus form was on the verge of extinction, the government was considering exempting it for the purpose of keeping the circus art alive considering the quality of life of the artists dependent on the circus and the entrepreneurs in the industry.
Government Decision: Government Decision No.
