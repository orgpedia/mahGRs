Circular:
The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 mandates obtaining prior approval of the Central Government for non-forest use of forest lands. The Ministry of Environment, Forests and
Climate Change, Govt. of India has accordingly issued guidelines for implementation of the said Act from time to time. Chapter-4 of the Handbook of Guidelines and Clarifications issued by the Ministry lays down guidelines in respect of General Approval under section 2 (ii) of the said Act for Critical Public and Strategic Defence Infrastructure, which include underground
Optical Fiber Cables. Based on the same, the State Governments have been authorized to exercise powers under section 2(ii) on behalf of the Central Government to decide the cases of diversion of forest lands along roads within existing RoWs (trench size not more than two meter in depth and one meter in width), not falling in National Parks and Sanctuaries. Such general approval conceded by the Central Government is subject to certain conditions apart
from those stipulated in paragraph 4.1 of the Handbook of Guidelines referred above and all other guidelines issued in that behalf by the Central Government as well as the State Government.
2. The Central Government vide the letter referred above at Sr. No.2 has clarified that the powers under general approval for granting approval under section 2(ii) shall be exercised by the State Government only, which means such powers cannot be further sub-delegated by the State Government.
3. The Government of Maharashtra is committed to ensure robust and smooth telecommunication facilities across the State, which include bringing the remote areas under telecommunication network for better connectivity. Many a times, OFC alignments include forest-lands, making obligatory for moving proposals under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. However, such patches of forests are spread across the district and more often than not, stretching across talukas as well as across forest-divisions. Under such circumstances, the user agencies are compelled to prepare separate proposals for each alignment, which do not move

In case, the proposed area falls in the RoW of the road passing through National Parks and Wildlife Sanctuaries, as per para 4.2 of the Handbook of Guidelines and Clarifications, General Approval is subject to requisite permissions from the State Wildlife Board for wildlife shall be obtained and in case, the proposed area falls in the RoW of the road passing through Tiger Reserves, General Approval is subject to requisite permissions from the National Board for Wildlife /NTCA shall be obtained.
