4) Achieving this goal. It should be done before March 31, 2022. In order to keep a check on the target recovery, the monthly report of the previous month on the recovery should be sent to the Director, Directorate of Geology and Mining, Nagpur in the prescribed format by the 10th of the next month and a copy of it should be forwarded to the government. The District Mining Officers and the concerned Deputy Collectors of the districts from where the information will not be received in the prescribed returns will be held responsible.
The Revenue Officers while depositing the amount in the treasury shall mention the head of accounts along with the computer notation and complete details thereof as applicable. The concerned Controlling Officer will be responsible for recovering the deposits as per the new head of accounts.
(6) Records of accruals from ownership of minor minerals should be consistent with the records of the Treasury and the Audit Office. Also, the amount of deposit should be adjusted from time to time.
The Divisional Commissioner shall consider the monthly returns in accordance with the objectives given to the districts in his department, give due instructions to all concerned from time to time and ensure that no district in the department is left behind in meeting the objectives. Every revenue department will be required to meet the target of minor minerals in any case. For this, if necessary, the concerned Divisional Commissioner can revise the target of the district under the department as per the need, while maintaining the overall target of his revenue department.
Since the trend of illegal mining and unauthorised transportation of minor minerals seems to be on the rise, it should be strictly ensured that no more than the permitted quantity is mined.
Also, the excavation of minor minerals should be measured by ETS machines after periodic inspection of the excavation sites. Necessary strict measures should be taken to prevent the unlicensed transportation of minor minerals. Tahsildars and sub-divisional officers should form vigilance teams at the sub-division level and taluk level to prevent illegal quarrying and unauthorised transportation. A register should be maintained at the sub-division/ tehsil level to record the details of action taken by such teams, and all sub-divisional officers should review the work done by the vigilance teams every month.
