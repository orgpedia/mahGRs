Introduction: Major, medium and minor projects of various architectural regional departments in Maharashtra are carried out for the repair, cleaning, de-silting and removal of trees and shrubs.
Project Soil works mainly include desilting of minor and medium project ponds and land levelling related to rehabilitation of project victims.
Explanatory instructions have been issued under reference No. 7 that when all types of minor minerals such as clay, limestone, stone are mined during the development of a plot and the minor mineral is used for the levelling of the same plot or it is used for any work in the process of development of such plot, such minor mineral shall not be eligible for levy of proprietary tax.
There is a need to levy ownership charges when the maintenance of the canals is repair and removal of soil or silt from it is a regular maintenance and repair work and the silt is used only for surfacing, agricultural improvement, etc.

Government Resolution No: Gauhani- 31/1017/ Q. No.11/ Kh-2
No, the matter of issuing a government decision was under the consideration of the government in order to get more clarity through the department.
Government Decisions: Under the Water Resources Department, the Regional Department of Architecture carries out the work of repairing canals, cleaning, de-silting and removal of trees on large, medium and small projects, as well as project soil work, repair of embankment of Kolhapuri system, land levelling related to rehabilitation of project victims, etc. The canal cleaning and repair works carried out by the construction departments through external agencies with the help of contractor's machinery are not considered as mining activity as they are regular maintenance and repair works. Therefore, the ownership fee is not payable on the minor mineral produced by such work. Also, if the silt/ soil is reused by the farmers for agricultural improvement, then ownership charges should not be levied on such excavated silt/ soil.
(2) This Act shall come into force on the date of its promulgation.
