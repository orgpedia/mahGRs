The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 and Rules, 2008 and Rules, 2012.
2) Tribal Development Department, Government Circular No. Petition No.124/ K-14 dated 11/11/2016.
Section 3 (1) of the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 and Rules, 2008 and Rules, 2012 as amended, provides for grant of individual and collective forest rights or both. In order to ensure proper implementation of the Act and to ensure forest rights, Gram Sabha Forest Rights Committees, Sub Divisional Committees and District Level Committees have been constituted in the State under Rule 6 of the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Amendment Rules, 2012. The committees take action to determine forest rights after considering the evidence and other relevant provisions specified in Rule 13.
2. However, it has been observed that due to workload, the claims scrutiny process is getting delayed for a long time. The district level committee should take a final decision within a maximum of 6 months from the receipt of forest rights claims. 2 Government circulars have been issued.
In view of the complaints of eviction from forest land while the process of verification of forest rights claims is underway, it is directed that the provisions of Section 4 (5) of the Forest Rights Act be complied with if it is established that forest rights claims are filed on such lands.
