The Proposal: -
Government Decisions, Revenue and Forest Department, No. Land-2505 / Q. No.405 / J-2, dated 12/12/2012 prescribes a revised policy regarding renewal of expired lease on government land in Brihanmumbai (Mumbai City District and Mumbai Suburban District). The policy directs that while calculating the value of the land held by the lessee, the annual market value rate CHER to be published annually by the stamping department shall be calculated as the total value of the income at the rate of open land. Also, Ma. In view of the judgment of the Bombay High Court, directions have been issued under the Government Judgment, Department of Revenue B, dated 12/12/2012 to charge a lease at a fixed rate of 25% to the Government, taking into account the 25% shareholding of the land owner i.e. Government and 75% shareholding of the lessee.
However, in Brihanmumbai, some government lands are more than 30 years old (e.g. 90 years, 99 years, 999 years) are long-term leases that have not yet expired. The terms / conditions of some government land leases granted by the lessee for such long periods contain provisions for revision of lease rates after a certain period of time. In cases where such long-term leases have not expired, the rate is revised after the prescribed period of 30 years of lease.

There is a huge difference between the rate calculated and the rate calculated as per the provision in the Government Decision, Department of Revenue B, dated 12/12/2012 in cases of lease expiry. This creates a sense of injustice among long-term tenants whose leases have not expired. Thus, the Digha period in the Mumbai city and Mumbai Suburban district, however, does not have an expiry date (e.g. Leases (90 years, 99 years, 999 years) also require policy decisions to be made.
03. The Government is of the view that if the date on which the annual rate of the lease is to be revised is 01/01/2012 or later after the completion of the minimum period of 30 years of such long term lease, it would be appropriate to consider 25% of the total value of the relevant income from the date 01/01/2012 as the share of the Government instead of 100% of the total value of the open land rate. It would be advisable to fix and recover the revised lease amount at a rate of 25% as per the Government Decision Date 12/12/2012 and Government Decision Date 05/05/2018. If the policy is set in this way, equal justice can be given to all. If such a case is received by the government, there will be no difficulty in taking a decision. There will also be no court cases. Also, in some cases, if there are currently very low leases, fixing the lease at a revised rate is likely to increase revenue.
Hence, the Government decision, dated 12/12/2012. Considering the formula laid down by the Bombay High Court (Government's share of long-term lease), it is justified to fix the land rent after 30 years in the case of lessee individuals / entities who have been given government land on lease for a period of 90,99,999 years and whose lease period of 30 years has expired. The Cabinet has taken meetings dated 11/12/2025.
