New supply holders/ manufacturers are being made available for Covid Medicine/ Lab Kits- RT-PCR Kit/ Rapid Antigen/ Antibody. So, be aware of this every time you make a purchase. Market prices are falling as new supply holders become available. Therefore, it is not necessary to make a large purchase at once.

Antigen/ Remdesivir/ Flavipiravir/ N95 should be purchased in small quantities and for a short period. It should be purchased within 15 to 20 days.
Although the price is fixed, it should be checked every time. It will be necessary to include in the purchase order such a condition that the purchasing department gets the benefit of the reduced rate in case of a large order.
