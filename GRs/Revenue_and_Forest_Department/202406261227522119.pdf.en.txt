Re: Being released: -
1) The leave pay of the officers of the Indian Forest Service shall not be paid unless the payroll of the period of leave taken in payment of leave pay has been received by the Cost-Accounting Authority.
2) The leave sanction orders, their transfer of charge certificate and taking charge certificate shall be submitted together to the Government after the officer enters the office after enjoying the sanctioned leave. The salary for the holiday period should be drawn after receiving the Rajyotsava letter from the government on the basis of these documents.
3) It was also noticed by the government that some officers were drawing the salary for the period of leave by enjoying the holiday even before the leave was sanctioned. This is a serious matter. Therefore, the provisions of the All India Services (Leave) Rules, 1955 and the Maharashtra Treasury Rules, 1968 (Rule 259) should be followed while dealing with leave pay. Such anomalies should also be carefully avoided in the future.
