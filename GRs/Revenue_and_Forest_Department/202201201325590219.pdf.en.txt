Preamble: The revenues of the Sangli city owned by the Sangli State during the pre-independence period have been provided to the local residents by way of land rent from 1907 to 1914 or thereafter for residential or commercial use on terms and conditions. In this way, the rich government of the time has provided the land by manifesto, public auction and fixed price. Whereas, some of the lands have been provided for the purpose of constructing houses in safer places, which were damaged due to the 1912 flood, in lieu of their lands, in Sangli city/ area and for this purpose, a notification has been issued on 5.09.1914. Similarly, a declaration was issued on 24.10.1914 for construction of buildings for people, factories, shops and comforts on certain conditions. In this declaration, the land has been provided by fixing the price of the plot (land) after determining the area-wise plot and taking the prescribed amount as a lump sum or by charging rent per annum in lieu of not paying such lump sum price. As mentioned above, such income provided at one-time cost has been recorded as' F' power in the government records. Similarly, the income provided by way of annual ground rent has been recorded as' E' in the official records. It has come to the notice of the government that the' E" registered in the government records is incorrectly registered as the authority and requests are being made by the local property owners to cancel it and resume the closed transfer transactions of land in this authority. Accordingly, the Collector, Sangli, has submitted the report of the inquiry conducted by the Town Geo-Assessment Officer, Sangli, and the District Superintendent of Land Records, Sangli, to the Government through the Divisional Commissioner, Pune. The term' Bhooibhade Ground Rent' has been used in the sense of Non-Agriculture Cess and it appears that the income is given by ownership. When the opinion of the Department of Law and Justice was taken in this regard, the Department has agreed to the following proposal of the Department, by giving the opinion that Ground Rent is not a Non-Agriculture Cess.
Those who have constructed a building on the plot given by the declaration dated 5.9.1914 and 24.10.1914 in Sangli city, according to the terms and conditions of the declaration, have received the right to transfer this income without permission.

2) The draft agreement and the available agreement show that the income from the traders' sites is given by the ownership at ground rent. Considering the fact that the agreement does not mention permission for transfer, the transfer of income in the form of" e" from traders' sites does not require government permission.
It was under the consideration of the government to take a policy decision in this matter in accordance with the consensus given by the Law and Justice Department.
GOVERNMENT DECISION: 1. The revenue beneficiaries whose lands have been taken by the then Sangli Government and in lieu of which other lands/ plots have been provided and the existing' E' category record on such income should be reduced and replaced with' A' category.
There's no fee to do this.
The income which the then Sangli government has provided to the beneficiaries at a lump sum price and the existing' F' category record on such income should be reduced and replaced with' A' category. There's no fee to do this.
3. The existing' E' category records on the income which the then Sangli Government has provided to the beneficiaries by levying rent every year and for such income, the beneficiaries have paid rent for at least 30 years, should be reduced and replaced with A-type records. There's no fee to do this.
The Superintendent of Land Records shall submit the proposal of such receipts in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 to the Collector, Sangli, within two months from the date of this Government decision.
After that, the collector should examine the proposal and decide on the change of power within a month. If no decision is taken within this period, such undecided cases should be submitted to the Divisional Commissioner. The Divisional Commissioner will decide on the extension of time in such cases.
If the income which the then Sangli Government has provided to the beneficiaries by charging rent annually and the beneficiaries have not paid rent for such income for at least the first 30 years, then the existing' E' type record on such income should be reduced by charging 15% of the current market value of the land and instead the' A' type record should be taken. In such cases, the Sub-Divisional Officer shall be the competent authority to authorize the change of authority.
This Government Resolution is being issued with the concurrence received under the Informal Reference No. 300/2021/ Expenditure-9 of the Department of Finance, dated 26th July, 2021.
