Agriculture to check the "Generalized Distinction Plant Directory" (NDVI) criteria at the meeting of the subcommittee.

The government has now taken the following decision.
GOVERNMENT RESOLUTION: - 1) By partial modification of the GOVERNMENT ORDER dated 22.06.2023 mentioned above. Since 01.01.2025, the "Normalized Difference Vegetative Index (NDVI)" criterion is being applied to provide assistance for crop losses due to other natural disasters, except for calamities.
2) Department of Agriculture. 01.01.2025 will take action to create an updated system to check the criteria for the "Normalized Difference Vegetative Index, NDVI."
A committee of Principal Secretary (Agriculture), Principal Secretary (Relief and Rehabilitation) is being set up under the chairmanship of the Additional Chief Secretary (Revenue). The committee will study updating the cadastral map of the affected account holders' area as well as suggest necessary measures. Since this criterion has been applied in Madhya Pradesh, the committee will examine the procedure there.
