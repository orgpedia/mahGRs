The Proposal:
In the backdrop of global warming, climatic and climatic changes, collective efforts are required to maintain ecological balance and biodiversity sustainability. For this, several schemes are being implemented by the government. In order to increase the forest cover in the state, the forest department undertakes a large number of afforestation and soil and water conservation works under various schemes. Most of the works are being done under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS). In the meantime, under the Government Decision dated 30.03.2021 in reference No. 4 of the Planning Department, a policy has been decided to take the desired work in MNREGA through convergence, combination and labour donation and complete it whenever required. Accordingly, the government has approved to take 100 per cent of the permissible works under MNREGA through convergence.

There is a difference between the wage rate payable under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme and the wage rate payable under the scheme. The objectives of both the schemes will be maximized if the difference in the wage rates between the two schemes is eliminated through convergence. Considering this, the government was considering to approve the top-up model of paying the difference under the convergence scheme under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme and the schemes related to afforestation and soil and water conservation in the forest areas.
Government Decision: The Government has decided to converge the schemes under various schemes implemented by the Forest Department for afforestation and soil and water conservation works (on public land under the Social Forestry Department and in forest areas under the Forest Department) with the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. Similarly, it is also being approved to prepare the budget of the soil and water conservation works in the forest and forest areas under the Convergence Scheme as per the scheme rate of the Forest Department and to pay the wages under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme while paying the actual wages under the Convergence as per the said budget. This should be called the top-up model. The procedure for this procedure is as follows:
(a) Selection of Sample Estimates The selection of Sample Estimates for various works of afforestation and soil and water conservation in forest areas (except Campa and Eco-battalion), which are being done under various schemes under the Forest Department, should be done at the time of preparation of the Sample Estimates for various works under the said Convergence. The committee constituted under the chairmanship of Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Budget, Planning and Development), Maharashtra, will have the power to amend the existing model budgets as per the need or to prepare some new model budgets on technical grounds.
(b) Technical and Administrative Sanctioning of Budget and Issuing of Execution Orders The authorities who have been delegated the powers to grant technical and administrative approval as per the existing provisions regarding administrative and technical approval to various works to be carried out under the State Schemes of the Forest Department, are being declared as the competent authority to grant technical and administrative approval under the said Convergence Scheme.

Also, to carry out the work directly at the field level, work order should be issued by the competent forest officers declared under the Forest Department as per the provisions of the prevailing government rules.
(e) Preparation of Budget and Payment of Wages All the works related to social forestry and afforestation in the forest area under the purview of the Forest Department and for soil and water conservation in the forest area under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme and under the proposed Convergence Schemes of the Schemes under the Forest Department should be budgeted as per the scheme rates of the Forest Department. Accordingly, while paying the actual wages under the Convergence Scheme, the difference (top-up) of the prevailing wages under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme from the prevailing wages under the schemes should be paid by the Forest Department through the Convergence Scheme. For this, the expenditure under the schemes implemented by the Forest Department should be met from the approved budget of that year. Further, all the works to be carried out under various schemes related to afforestation and soil and water conservation (except Campa and Eco-Battalion) (intensive afforestation programme, plantation of trees on both sides of important roads, canals and roads, greening of hills on both sides of important roads, modernization and strengthening of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Government Nurseries, protection of sea coast through afforestation, construction of forest floor/ cement bund, etc.) should be done under this convergence scheme only. Under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, 263 works are permissible. All works to be carried out under the Convergence Scheme shall be carried out by ensuring that they are among those permissible under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme as notified by the Central Government from time to time/ as provided in the Act.
(e) Availability of funds for skilled work The afforestation works are expected to be completed within the stipulated time as it depends on the season. For this, timely availability of funds for skilled work is a must. Therefore, since the skilled work of nurseries under the forest department under the scheme needs to be started in a time-bound manner, these works should be completed only with the provisions available under the schemes.

e) Disciplinary action: If any irregularity is found in the implementation of the scheme, disciplinary action will be taken against the concerned by the competent authority of the forest department as per the prevailing service conditions of the forest department.
After completion of the works as per the budget of the various works sanctioned under the Convergence, out of the total amount of wages payable for the said works, the remaining amount of difference in wages (top-up) by paying the prevailing wage amount under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) shall be paid from the provisions available under the respective State Schemes during the year. The amount of difference shall be in accordance with the difference between the rate of wages payable under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme prevailing at that time and the rate of wages fixed for the scheme under the scheme (the rate of wages fixed by the Labour Commissioner, Mumbai). Further, since the efficient functioning of nurseries is required to be started in a time bound manner out of the afforestation works to be carried out under the said convergence scheme as mentioned in point number e), these works should be completed only with the provision available in that year under the said schemes.
(3) The decision of the Government. As per the decision taken by the Cabinet on 16th July, 2023 and as per the consensus reached on the proposal under Informal Reference No. 194/ Expenditure-10 dated 20.04.2023 of Finance Department and Informal Reference No. 127/1475 dated 13.04.2023 of Planning Department and Informal Reference No.6/ MGRRO-5 dated 18.04.2023 of Employment Guarantee Division.
