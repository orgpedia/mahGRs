Preamble: In view of the change in the jurisdiction of the Accountants General, Mumbai and Nagpur, the deposits/ expenditure of the Revenue Department, the Commissioner of Settlement and the Director of Land Records, Maharashtra State, Pune and their subordinate offices will be audited by the Principal Accountant General (Audit)-1, Maharashtra, Mumbai and the deposits/ expenditure of the Forest Department and Inspector General of Registration and Controller of Stamps, Maharashtra State, Pune and their subordinate offices will be audited by the Accountant General (Audit)-2, Maharashtra, Nagpur.
It has been consistently pointed out in various reports submitted to the Legislature by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India that the Department has not been responding to the audit objections received from the Accountant General's office. As a result, the number of pending cases is increasing. The Public Accounts Committee has expressed serious displeasure over the large number of pending paragraphs and has advocated the need for efforts in the form of campaigns. With a view to reduce the number of pending audit objections, all the Controlling Officers and all the Heads of Offices under the Revenue and Forest Department are being instructed as follows.
1. Audit Intimation Letter is usually sent to the concerned office two to three weeks in advance by the Accountant General regarding the audit of any office, according to which the head of the office should appoint the responsible officer of the office as the" Nodal Officer" for the audit.

The Head of the Office and all the Branch Officers should attend the discussion to be held before the audit is started as per the requirement in the specific form of audit by the audit team and discuss the audit in detail with the audit team.
All records required for the audit (registers/ receipts/ payments etc.) should be made available to the audit team immediately. The head of the office should ensure that there is no complaint from the audit team for not providing the records to the audit and if the complaint is received, the complaint is resolved.
Half Margin Memo (HMM) is issued by the Audit Team of the Accountant General's Office while examining the records of the office or to request some additional information. The head of the office should personally verify the issues raised by the audit team in the half-time letter and give self-explanatory point-wise compliance to it with his own signature at the same time, so that the objections are not included in the inspection report of the Accountant General after the completion of the preliminary stage.
On the last day of the audit, the draft inspection report is discussed by the audit team during the reading of the report. At that time, the head of the office along with all the concerned officers should discuss each paragraph of the accounting objection with the audit team on an issue-wise basis and if the objection is submitted at the same time along with the necessary documents for proper compliance, the objections can be excluded from the audit report of the Accountant General.
6. Efforts should be made to remove the irregularities and deficiencies in audit objections during the period till the receipt of inspection report from the Accountant General's office, so as to facilitate timely submission of compliance of audit objections. The head of the office should ensure that while submitting compliance of audit objections, they should be based on facts and the irregularities in the said objection will not be reversed.
7. In the ongoing audit, if the previous pending accounting objections are submitted in a proper manner, then those objections are also removed from the audit team on the spot. Therefore, compliance of pending paragraphs should be provided while the audit is in progress.
Thereafter, if the inspection report (IR) is sent by the Accountant General's Office to the concerned office/ its controlling officer and the government within one month and if the objections are submitted in compliance with it along with the draft and supplementary documents, then the objections are also excluded from the Accountant General's Office.
The Sixth Report of the pending paragraphs from the Accountant General's Office is sent to the Government twice a year and the Government sends it to the concerned offices and informs them about the compliance of the pending paragraphs with the Accountant General's Office with all relevant records.
