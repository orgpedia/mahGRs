Government Decision No: Establishment-2024 / P.No.101 / M-1,

Date: September 20, 2024.
Proposal- "
The Registration and Stamp Department, under the administrative control of the Revenue and Forest Department, is the second-largest revenue earner to the government. This department is also counted as the service department as well as the records department. There are currently 520 secondary registrar offices functioning in the state under the jurisdiction of the department, providing documentation and ancillary services to the public through these offices. With increasing urbanization and industrialization leading to a huge increase in the transactions of transfer of immovable income, there has been a huge increase in the number of documents filed for registration in various secondary registrar offices in the state.
Since the department is required to create a new secondary registrar's office within the jurisdiction of any secondary registrar's office where more than 8000 documents are generally filed for registration in a year, new secondary registrar offices have been created and designated accordingly from time to time. In the last few years, the cycle of development has not been limited to Mumbai, Thane, Pune but has accelerated in all parts of the state, with the number of real estate transactions increasing more or less in all parts of the state. As a result, there is a growing demand from citizens / public representatives for the creation of new offices as the number of documents in the secondary registrar offices is increasing and some offices are over-capacity. Accordingly, it was under the consideration of the Government to review the functioning of the Secondary Registrar's Offices in various districts of the State and fix the standard of enrolment in the Secondary Registrar's Offices in all parts of the State in a decentralized manner to facilitate proper service delivery to the people of the area. The government has taken the following decisions in this regard:
