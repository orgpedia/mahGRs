5. Not all farmers in drought affected areas are expected to be provided with TDS. Many farmers have wells and they cultivate on the water of the well. Therefore, the affected farmers who have suffered crop loss of 33% or more in the drought-affected areas should be given a fixed subsidy as per the SDRF/ NDRF norms. To determine the 33% crop loss, the area under the crops with less than 67% income should be made eligible for the subsidy and the subsidy should be distributed to the farmers based on the crop-wise income (before deducting the weighted average) as per the results of the crop harvesting experiment conducted in that gram panchayat area for the final payment in the kharif season. For this purpose, the crop-wise income derived at the gram panchayat level will be applicable to all the villages in that gram panchayat.
The input subsidy should be distributed to the account holders who have suffered a loss of 33% or more of the agricultural crop.
The allocation of this assistance should be made on the basis of the record of crops as on 7/12 of Kharif season 2021.
8.Agriculture-wise panchnama should be done to ascertain the loss of 33 percent or more of perennial crops. Photographs of the fruits should be taken with the panchnama (Global Positioning System (GPS enabled), so that the claim of damage can be verified.
9. The criterion for determining the loss of perennial crops will be 7/12 record. The panchnama will be the criterion for determining the severity of the damage. To determine the loss of perennial fruit crops, it is necessary to note 7/12.

Government Resolution No: SCY-2021/ PR No.117/ M-7,
1) The amount will be credited directly to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries. No cash or financial assistance will be provided to the victims.
2) No bank shall recover any amount from the account holders while crediting the amount directly to their bank accounts.
3) The amount to be distributed to the affected farmers should be provided through direct benefit transfer to the Aadhaar-linked bank account of the concerned farmers. But if a person does not have an Aadhaar number, then such a person should not be deprived of the benefit, so that he can get it on the basis of other alternative and viable identity cards (e.g. Aadhaar Card, Aadhaar Card, etc.). Aadhaar, Voter ID, PAN, Driving License, Passport, Bank Account Number, Passport, etc.
The expenditure for this purpose shall be met from the provisions available for the financial year 2022-23 under the head Demand No.C-6, Principal Accounts Head-2245, Assistance for Relief of Natural Calamities, 01 Drawback, (91) Expenditure as per State Disaster Response Fund norms, (91) (05) Assistance to farmers on account of crop loss, (2245 2434), 31 Subsidiary Grants (Non-salaried).
14. Funds distributed for distribution to the affected persons in natural calamities are transferred to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries by the Drawing and Disbursing Officers at the Taluk level. Some banks keep the returned funds in the Suspense Account due to technical reasons such as the beneficiary's name, account number does not match. Actually, the amount transferred to the bank has to be either credited to the account of the beneficiary or credited to the account of the withdrawal and disbursement officer. However, instead of depositing such amounts in the accounts of Drawing and Disbursing Officers, banks keep them in the Suspension Account. Over a period of time, such amounts remain unaccounted for and remain with the banks for which they are supposed to be credited back to the government.
To prevent this, it is important to balance these amounts over a period of time. However, all the Drawing and Disbursing Officers shall take action to reconcile the amounts transferred before and after every week.
