The Proposal: -
Section 37 (3) of the SAH Act, 2013, provides for fair compensation and transparency in land acquisition, rehabilitation and resettlement, with the Collector disclosing to the public the details of the land acquired in the final form, including the award to each person, the amount of compensation paid, and the summary of the entire action taken in respect of the land acquisition, and displaying it on the website created for the purpose.
However, it has come to the notice of the Government that as per Section 37 (3) of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, such final judgments are not displayed on the website for public viewing.
The issue of issuing directions in this regard was under the consideration of the government.
