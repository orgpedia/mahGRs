At present, the farmers registered in the e-crop inspection system have been approved by the government.
Instead, the crop inspection recorded by the farmers is considered to be self-certified and only
It is necessary to give instructions regarding the inspection of ten percent crop inspection by talathas.
In the background of all the above, due to the change in the method of taking the records of the previous crops by the concerned talathis, now the farmers will be able to get the e-pick from their smart mobile phones.
The recording of the crop has begun. Accordingly, the matter of amending the procedure for crop inspection under the provisions of Rules 29 and 30 of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Rights Records and Records (Preparation and Maintenance) Rules, 1971 was under consideration of the Government.
