First Floor, Main Building, Hutatma Rajguru Chowk, Madame Cama Marg Mantralaya, Mumbai-400032.
Date: 9th of May 2023
Reference:
(1) The Maharashtra Minor Mineral Exploration (Development and Regulation) Rules, 2013. 01.11.2021.
The Proposal:
In exercise of the powers conferred by section 15 (1) (3) of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 (67 of 1957), the Government of Maharashtra have framed the Maharashtra Minor Mineral Exploration (Development and Regulation) Rules, 2013 and published the same in the Gazette dated 19.08.2013.
Reference No. 2 The Government has been instructed by the circular that while developing a plot, all types of minor minerals such as soil, acacia, stone etc. will be mined and used for the levelling of the same plot or it will be used for any work in the process of development of such plot, at that time such minor mineral will not be eligible for levy of ownership charge.
But in some areas of the plot, while developing that plot, it is not possible to use the entire minor mineral extracted from the plot for the development of the same plot. It is examined whether the permission of the zonal machinery has been taken by the developer for the work of such a plot developer. If it is found that the developer has excavated more than the permissible limit, penal action is taken as per Section 48 (7) of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, 1966.

The fine and measurement was done by the regional officials. A petition is pending in the Supreme Court. Accordingly, considering the area to be developed by the developer, the amount of minor minerals that can be transported outside the plot in general and how many minor minerals will be used in the same place in general, the government was considering to determine the procedure for charging ownership fee on it.
