Introduction: In case of human loss due to attack by tiger, leopard, bear, bison, wild boar, wolf, hyena, jackal, crocodile, elephant, rhino (Dhol), rohi (Nilgai) and monkey/ monkey, the financial assistance is given to the concerned as per the category of death, permanent disability, serious injury, minor injury.
Many times in the attack of wild animals human does not die, but gets serious or minor injuries.
Every effort is made by the administration to ensure that the injured person gets proper and immediate treatment and is available at the government hospital on priority. Sometimes, a government hospital with useful resources is not available nearby and in such cases, the injured person has to go to a private hospital and get immediate treatment.
The government was considering increasing the existing financial assistance for death, permanent disability, grievous injury and minor injury. In response to the demand from the people's representatives to increase the financial assistance, the government has decided to increase the amount of financial assistance/ expenditure in the case of human death, permanent disability, serious injury and minor injury due to wildlife attack as follows.
