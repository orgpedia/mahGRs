The power conferred under the provisions of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, 1966 and the Maharashtra Land Revenue (Appeal, Revision and Revision) Rules, 1967 and other rules under the said Code shall extend to the administration of cases of quasi-judicial proceedings in respect of land. Minister (Revenue) During the hearing of such appeals/ revision applications before the Hon'ble Minister (Revenue), it has been observed that the Regional Revenue Officers have not been implementing the orders passed by the Additional Commissioner/ Deputy Director (Land Records) or the competent authority for several months or have not taken proper record of such orders in the official records. Even after such orders are challenged at the government level, such orders are not implemented at the regional level and are not recorded in the records of the authority.
However, after the hearing of the appeal/ revision application filed at the government level is conducted and the notice of the hearing is sent to the Collector's office for forwarding to all concerned, the process of implementing the order passed by the Additional Commissioner/ Deputy Director (Land Records) or the competent authority in haste is carried out at the field level. And that's not fair and right. Accordingly, the matter of issuing directions to all the revenue authorities and officers to implement the quasi judicial orders and to register the same in the register of rights was under consideration of the Government.
Government circular:
In exercise of the powers conferred by the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, 1966 and the rules made thereunder, the Regional Revenue Officer and the Authority are hereby directed to take appropriate action in respect of a quasi-judicial matter in respect of execution of the impugned order and to take proper record of the same on record: (1) The orders passed by the Additional Commissioner/ Deputy Director (Land Records) or the competent authority shall be governed by the provisions of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code Act, Rules and the State Government.
