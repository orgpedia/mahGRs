Government Decision No: Gokhani - 10/0125 Q. No.05 / B-1,
Martyr Rajguru Chowk,
Madame Cama Marg, Mantralaya Mumbai-32,
Date: 9th October, 2025
Read: - 1) Chapter V of the Maharashtra Minor Mineral Exploration (Development and Regulation) Rules, 2013.
2) Government Decision, Revenue & Forest Department, No: Gaukhani - 10/0125 Q. No. 05 / B-1, D. 08.04.2025
The Proposal: -
Under the sand / sand policy, it has been made mandatory for the auctioneers to provide a maximum of 10% of the sand mined by them free of cost to the eligible auctioneers for river / creek clearance under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana as well as to the households of the beneficiaries belonging to economically weaker sections. As a result, the respective auctioneers are overburdened with the sand that is made available to the housing beneficiaries. Hence, the government was contemplating to introduce a provision for auctioning 90 per cent of the quantity of sand being auctioned assuming the value of the sand at hand.
Also, as per the Government Decision dated 08.04.2025, the auction period for eco-permitted sand dunes in the riverbed has been fixed at 2 years and 3 years for backwater dunes. However, since the exact amount of sand storage is not known at the end of the first year when determining the sand group, the next year after the end of the first year may result in a loss of revenue for the government if more sand is stored in the next year after the end of the first year. Hence, it was under the consideration of the Government to revise the auction period for river / basin sand blocks to 1 year.
The government's decision:
Government Decision, Revenue & Forest Department, No.: Gokhani - 10/0125 Q. No. 05 / B-1, D. In Part IV of the 08.04.2025 - "Exit by Auction," the provision at serial number (iv) is being repealed and replaced with the following amended provision: -
(iv) Upset Price: - The amount of sand ownership as fixed by the Government from time to time and the amount after multiplying by 90% of the quantity of sand that can be quarried from the respective sand blocks should be fixed as the Upset price of such sand block. For this, the sub-divisional officer will determine the price of all the auctionable items under his jurisdiction.
