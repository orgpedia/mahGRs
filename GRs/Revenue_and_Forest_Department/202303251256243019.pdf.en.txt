The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 and Rules 2008 thereunder, as amended, 2012.
As mentioned in the Preamble of the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, the forest dwellers who have been living in the forest since historical times, whose livelihood depends on the forest, who have traditionally been dependent on the forest and have a major role in maintaining the forest, have been neglected during colonization. Also, since forest dwellers have not been registered in any government record on forest land even after India's independence, it is an injustice that the land or other rights of such forest dwellers have not been adequately recognized. The above mentioned Act has been passed to provide safe and long-lasting rights to forest dwellers who have been traditionally dependent on forest land due to the consolidation of forests in the intervening period and various sections of the Forest Conservation and Protection Act. The process of determination of rights in the claims received under the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 as amended in 2008 and Rules, 2012 is underway at the field level.
As per Rule 15 (6) of the Rules under the said Act, the Revenue and Forest Department of the State of Maharashtra vide its circular dated 2nd January, 2012, has made a provision for taking the records of the land claims recognized under the Forest Rights Act in G.No. 7/12 as" Other Rights" and the" Other Rights" of the forest rights holders recognized under Section 3 (1) (a) of the said Act. N. No.
7/12 are allocated.
As per the instructions of this circular, the records of forest land of forest rights holders are made in G.No. 7/12. In fact, the burden on the" other rights" mentioned above 7/12 includes the recording of debts, dismemberment, recording of the names of the holders of other rights, etc.
The Forest Rights Act provides for the rights to be protected and long-lasting.
Under the Recognition of Forest Rights of Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers Act, 2006 and Rules 2008 and Amendments Rules 2012, the Lien of the individual forest rights holders vide G.No. 7/12 is held by the said occupant class 2 (with new and indivisible condition)
