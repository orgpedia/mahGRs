Introduction: Since the formation of Panvel Municipal Corporation, the villages included in the corporation area have not been mapped due to the absence of town geodesy. As the extent and area of the plots in the gaothan area has not been determined, it is necessary to calculate the gaothan area in the revenue villages under the Panvel Municipal Corporation, it has been decided to calculate the gaothan area in these 24 revenue villages under the Panvel Municipal Corporation and to prepare a map of the plot and ownership document by giving the town geodetic number. However, the counting could not be completed within the stipulated time as the government imposed restrictions on the attendance of officers/ staff from time to time during the Corona transition period. Therefore, the matter of extending the time for counting the village area in the revenue villages under the Panvel Municipal Corporation was under the consideration of the government. The government has taken the following steps in this regard:
