(2) The consideration for refund of the proportionate amount of the auction shall be: -
(i) The bid amount b should be calculated as per the estimated sand stock in the auction as per the per capita or per metric ton price of sand as the case may be.
(ii) Average quantity of sand to be mined per day should be determined based on the estimated sand stock in the auction and the time available for sand mining.
The amount of sand that could not be excavated during the moratorium / closure period should be determined based on the period for which the auctioneer had to suspend / close the sand quarrying for a reasonable reason beyond his capacity and the average quantity of sand to be excavated per day.
(iii) The amount payable to the bidder at the rate of repurchase or per metric ton, as the case may be, for such sand, whichever is less, between the fixed sand reserve and the actual uncultivated sand reserve.
(3) The amount of the auction shall not be refunded for the following reasons: -
According to the terms and conditions of the sand / sand exit policy, as well as the terms and conditions of the auction notice, before participating in an AMAA auction, it is necessary to make sure that the baby site has the expected sand stock, or that the necessary roads are available for the bahtuko. Also, it is the responsibility of the auctioneer to excavate the sand with the help of permitted tools. Hence, a refund of the auction amount will not be admissible for any reason, such as lack of expected sand stock in the sand dunes, non-availability of roads required for bahtuko, water in the bahtuk, mud-bleed, suction pump not being permitted for bahtuko excavation.
If the bidder does not pay 1 ⁄ 4 of the amount on time, his reserve should be forfeited. If the bidder does not pay the remaining 3 / 4 in time after paying 1 / 4, he should forfeit 1 / 4 of the payment. The seized amount will not be refunded to the auctioneer under any circumstances.

(i) There should be a single road for sand transportation between each of the baby pits.
(1) CCTVs shall be installed at each ABTA location by the auctioneer for 2457 photographs. Also, at least one CCTV camera should be installed at the point where the baby is being loaded into the vehicle and all the vehicles transporting the child sand should be used for the photography of the place from where the child travels to and from the village.
The cost of CCTV installed at the sand dunes will have to be borne by the auctioneers / licensees. Also, CCTV cameras should be installed at places where there is a possibility of transportation to prevent illegal transportation of unsold sand, and action should be taken to provide funds for this from the District Planning Committee.
(1) It shall be mandatory for the auctioneer / licensee to make available the CCTV on the website designated by the Government for public survey.
(iv) The address of the CCTV installed by the auctioneer / licensee shall be required to be furnished to the Collector / Divisional Commissioner and the Revenue and Forest Department of the Government. It will be mandatory for the auctioneer to submit a CD containing photographs of sand quarrying and transportation to the tehsildar's office every 15 days. A CCTV control room should be set up in the tehsil office functioning 24X7 to control sand mining on the basis of CCTV installed in the sand pit by the auctioneer / licensee. The control room should be periodically inspected by the concerned Collector / Sub Divisional Officer. Also, access will be made available to the general public for controlling sand mining on the basis of CCTV installed in the sand dunes by the auctioneer / licensee.
(5) The Tahsildar shall examine the photograph in the said CD through his subordinate machinery. The concerned Tehsildar B Sub Divisional Officer should also inspect such photographs from time to time. If such an investigation finds that the CCTV camera is closed for a period of time, the CCTV footage of the sand pit in the control room shows unauthorized excavation, then CCTV at that rate will be calculated by calculating the WAST amount as per the auction amount assuming that the average excavation was done on the day the CCTV camera was closed, taking into account the day available for the excavation of the approved balsam b sand.
A penalty amount equal to the amount of sand excavated during the period when the camera is closed should be recovered from the auctioneer. No matter how long the CCTV is off on a given day, the penalty amount should be charged and recovered as above assuming that the CCTV is off for the entire day.
(vi) Every village labourer taluka shall be required to visit the children's group in its jurisdiction regularly. It will also be mandatory for the concerned auctioneer / licensee to keep a gift certified by the Tehsildar.

If it is found that illegal baby quarrying / transportation continues unabated in the jurisdiction of an officer even after investigation, a proposal for disciplinary action against the concerned should be submitted to the government through the departmental authorities assuming that the officer concerned is in connivance with the persons involved in the illegal quarrying / transportation.
Three - Action to be taken if the bidder / licensee violates the terms / conditions: - (i) If the bidder consents among themselves, no bidder comes forward to bid even after repeated bidding of certain sand blocks and hence no sand block auction can take place.
