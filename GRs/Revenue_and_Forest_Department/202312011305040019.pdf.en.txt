Government's decision:
In order to resolve the day-to-day problems of the general public and farmers related to the field offices under the Revenue Department quickly and to make the revenue administration more people-oriented, transparent, efficient and dynamic, the Government has decided to implement the ambitious program" Maharajaswa Abhiyan" throughout the state from January 1, 2024 to March 31, 2024.
(a) People-oriented components: Under the Maharajaswa Abhiyan, the following people-oriented components should be effectively implemented from the Collectorate to the village level under the leadership of the Collector/ Additional Collector:
(i) Disposing of the pending manipulations for more than one month and holding of manipulation adalat at the Mandal Headquarters for the same: The manipulation adalat should be held at the Tehsil and Mandal level by determining the number of simple and disputed manipulations pending for more than one month at the Mandal level. The District Collector/ Sub-Divisional Officer and Tahsildar shall supervise and ensure that the registered and unregistered simple records are not kept pending for more than 1 month and the disputed records for more than 3 months without any valid reason and the programme should be given wide publicity at the local level.
(The report in this regard should be compiled in the progress report- Form A-1 attached with the present Government decision.) (ii) Updation of Village Offices by preparing more or less sheets in cases of land acquisition and grant of agricultural permission: It has been observed that in some cases, the names of the original owners in the Village Offices have remained unchanged due to non-updation of all the records in the Village Offices by preparing more or less sheets even after the acquisition of private lands. Further, despite grant of non-agriculture permission/ development permission, there is no independent record of rights over roads, amenity areas, open spaces and developable plots, leading to illegal transfer transactions and wrongful record of rights leading to legal complications.
In order to prevent this, instructions have been issued to implement the campaign in this regard through a separate semi-government letter No. SANKIN 2022/ Q.No.584/ L-1, Dy. 08.12.2022 and D. 13.01.2023. Accordingly, as per the provisions of the Land Acquisition Manual and Maharashtra Land Revenue Manual, in the case of a judgment in a land acquisition case and in all cases of non-agriculture and development permits, more or less sheets must be prepared and their implementation must be taken in the village sample number 7/12, group map and other relevant village samples.
In this regard, the number of pending cases should be fixed on the preparation of" less and more sheets" after reviewing the land acquisition and non-agriculture permission cases of all the districts and the process of updating all the maps and village samples should be completed by planning the action on it.

Under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 Part VII, private lands have been acquired for industrial purposes for companies. Section 44A of the Act provides:
" No company for which any land has been acquired under this Part shall be entitled to sell, mortgage, donate, lease or otherwise transfer the said land or any part thereof, except with the previous sanction of the appropriate Government. " For such companies, the tenancy of land acquired for industrial purposes should always be kept in category-2.
Government Resolution No. Parivartan- 01/2017/ No. 11/ A-2, D. 11.01.2018 under Part VII of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, the policy for sale/ change of use of acquired land for industrial purposes has been prescribed for companies. In the Government Resolution No. SANKIRAN 2022/ Q.No.54/ A-2, Dy. This has been amended w.e.f. 29.06.2022. According to this policy, free recovery in the cases allowed by the government as well as the availability of up-to-date status of these companies is an important aspect of government revenue.
It has come to the notice of the government that no records have been taken on the land rights records, 7/12 and income tax returns. Therefore, without obtaining government permission, third party interests are created and court cases arise. In turn, the government loses revenue. Considering this fact, such land should be recorded as per the award 7/12 as well as in the income tax return. Further, as per the directions given in the Government Resolution No. 2021/ PR No. 10/ J-1A, dated 15.03.2021, separate data of land acquired in Village Sample Number C should be collected. The land records should be updated in order to increase the government revenue.
