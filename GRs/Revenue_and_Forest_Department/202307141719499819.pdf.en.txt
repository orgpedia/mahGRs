Preamble: The Housing Department has issued a Government Resolution dated 13.09.2019 on the recommendation of a High Level Committee constituted with a view to encouraging all registered cooperative housing societies on Government/ semi-Government/ private land in the State to undertake self-development of their buildings. Point number 9 (b) of this Government Resolution reads as follows:
Point No.9 (b):- No agreement is required to be entered into in a self-development project as there is no third beneficiary other than the existing cooperative housing society. Therefore, as the proposed houses are made available to the existing slum dwellers through self-development, the stamp duty should be levied from the members of the self-development cooperative housing society as per the stamp duty of Rs.1000/- levied from the beneficiaries of the project implemented under the PM Awas Yojana on the contract for such new slums. However, stamp duty at the prevailing rate should be levied on the agreement for plots available for sale in the open market in addition to the original member flats in the new building to be constructed after self-redevelopment.
2. In accordance with the provisions of the said Government Order, the following explanation is being given regarding the levy of stamp duty on the agreement between the registered cooperative housing society and the original tenant/ tenant/ member.
1) If the proposed houses in the self-improvement project of the registered cooperative housing societies in the state will be available to the original flats/ tenant/ members through self-improvement, then on the allotment letter/ agreement between the cooperative housing society and the tenant/ tenant/ member, Rs. 1000/- (Rupees One Thousand).
Stamp duty will be payable as per the provisions of Maharashtra Stamp Act on the agreement for flats/ flats available for sale in the open market other than the original flat/ flat holder/ member.
If a member of the society purchases additional area from the society in lieu of the original flat/ plot in addition to the free flat/ plot area in the self-improvement project, then stamp duty will be payable on such purchased area as per the provisions of the Maharashtra Stamp Act.
4) Stamp duty will be payable as per the provisions of the Maharashtra Stamp Act on the work contract between the contractor appointed for the self-redevelopment project of registered cooperative housing societies and the concerned cooperative housing society.
