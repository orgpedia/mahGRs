the prelude
Since cash is the primary and most important accounting record in any office, it is very important to write the cash book daily, accurately, so that there is no scope for any fraud/ theft related to the irregularities in the cash book.
Provisions have been made in the Bombay Financial Rules, 1959 and the Maharashtra Treasury Rules, 1968 regarding writing off of cash. The government has also issued guidelines in this regard. In paragraph 7 of this circular, the offices whose cash operations are incomplete. It has been ordered to complete by 31/12/2022 and submit its report to the Head of the Department, while the concerned Head of the Office and their Controlling Officer, if the cash operations as mentioned in paragraph 8 have not been completed, will be informed by the concerned Collector/ Divisional Commissioner/ Inspector General of Registration and Controller of Stamps, Pune/ Jamabandi Commissioner Director Bhoomi Records, Pune, to the Government Circular Revenue and Forest Department, Dy. The action was reported on 25.4.2005.
The quarterly report of the financial discipline regarding the balance in the bank account of the Drawing and Disbursing Officers under the Divisional Commissioner's Office is submitted to the Government. As per the said report, instructions are issued from time to time by the government to write the cash book regularly to avoid irregularities/ malpractices, to take a case-wise breakup of the balance in the cash book at the end of the month and to reconcile the balance in the bank and to review the unpaid amounts and pay such amounts to the government regularly. Instructions regarding cash withdrawal have already been issued by the Government through circulars/ letters to the offices concerned at that time. However, there seems to be no proper implementation from the Drawing and Disbursing Officer/ Controller.
It has been reported that some offices have been affected due to the non-compliance of the instructions regarding writing cash. Therefore, the following instructions regarding cash are being issued through a circular.
