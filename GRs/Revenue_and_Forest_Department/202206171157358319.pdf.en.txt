dated 17.06.2022.
GOVERNMENT DECISION, REVENUE AND FOREIGN DEPARTMENT NO. WLP- 03.08/ PS No. 87 (Part-I)/ F-1, D. 23.03.2018.
Preamble: Although the habitat of wild elephants is not found in the state of Maharashtra, provision has been made under the decision of the relevant government to provide financial assistance for the loss of agricultural crops and other property due to wild animals coming from other states. However, the prevailing Government decision does not include the provision for payment of compensation in case of damage to buildings/ houses due to wildfire.
Since there is a possibility of resentment among the villagers towards the forest department in connection with the damage caused to the building/ house, it is necessary to make a provision for compensation in such cases. Accordingly, it was under the consideration of the Government to amend the Government decision to include the matter of providing financial assistance in case of damage to buildings/ houses due to wildfire by superseding the relevant Government decision.
Government Decision: Provisions are being made regarding payment of compensation for loss due to wildfire as follows:
(a) Financial assistance for damage to other property.
