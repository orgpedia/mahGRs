As per the provisions of the Maharashtra Slum (Improvement, Eradication and Redevelopment) Act, 1971, if a slum rehabilitation scheme is to be implemented on privately owned land, there is a provision to take such encroached privately owned land for slum rehabilitation scheme after negotiating with the concerned land owner.
It shall be mandatory to pay 10% of the value of such land as may be mutually agreed upon/ negotiated/ agreed upon to the Government as consideration for acquisition of Wattan/ Inam lands for Slum Rehabilitation Scheme and such privately owned land for Slum Rehabilitation Scheme over Mahar Wattan lands.
