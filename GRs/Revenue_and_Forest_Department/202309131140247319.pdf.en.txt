Introduction: It has been decided to implement Dr. Syama Prasad Mookerjee Jan Van Vikas Yojana in the state under the Government Resolution No. 1 for the overall development of villages by ensuring sustainable development of the resources of people, water, forest and land in the villages adjacent to the forest, increasing productivity by reducing the dependence of the villagers on the forest, creating complementary linkages to agriculture, providing alternative employment, reducing human-wildlife conflict and thus raising the level of protection and management of forest and wildlife through the participation of the villagers.
Considering the incidents of human wildlife conflict, farm crop loss and livestock loss in the last three years, the villages of the White Fort Forest Division have been included in Reference No. As there are no villages within the Wildlife Sanctuary or the Wildlife Sanctuary identified by the Wildlife Institute of India, the inclusion of these 22 villages as a special case under the Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Jan-Van Vikas Yojana was under the consideration of the Government.
Government's decision:
Under Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Jan-Van Vikas Yojana, the following 32 villages in Pandharkawada forest division selected as sensitive areas in terms of human-wildlife conflict are being approved by the government.
