Proposal: - In case of loss of crops due to natural calamities such as heavy rains, floods and cyclones, the farmers are provided assistance at the prescribed rate from the State Disaster Response Fund at the rate of one time per season (105. Subsidy).
Also, assistance is provided at the prescribed rate for other sanctioned aspects of the State Disaster Response Fund.
Government Decisions, Revenue and Forest Department, Govt. 13.05.2015 and d. Criteria and rates of State Disaster Response Fund have been prescribed under 27.03.2023.
Ambegaon and Junnar taluks of Pune district. Due to Cyclone Nisarga on 3rd June 2020, assistance was sought from the Collector, Pune from Ambegaon and Junnar taluka levels for Hirada- 7066.79 Quital damage. Ginger trees grow naturally in scattered forms, mainly on privately owned land and dams owned by farmers, and the germ is derived from these trees. This makes it impossible to determine the affected area of the gum. As a result, aid from the State Disaster Response Fund could not be provided to the affected rescuers. Hence, the zonal system had calculated the trees and fruits and based on that, demanded the subsidy at the then local market price. There are no previous reports of damage from this type of disaster being of a rare nature in the district. Hirda is the main source of livelihood for the tribal shotkars of Junnar and Ambegaon taluks. A proposal in this regard was received from the Collector, Pune. It was put up for consideration in the Cabinet meeting held on 25 February 2024. The issue of issuance of the order was under consideration in accordance with the decision taken in the matter by the Cabinet.
