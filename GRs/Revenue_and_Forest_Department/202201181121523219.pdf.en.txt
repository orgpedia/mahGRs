Recommendation No. 1.43 of the Thirty-third Report of the Comptroller and Auditor-General of India, 2017-18.
Government circular:
To take action on priority in respect of pending paragraphs of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India and the recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee. Recommendation No. 38 of the Thirty-third Report of 2017-18. In 1.43 the following observations are made:
" When the Accountant General conducted a sample investigation of such cases under the Revenue and Forest Department, the department has raised serious objections such as under-assessment of consumption value due to imposition of agricultural price instead of agricultural rate, wrong assessment of consumption value due to imposition of wrong market price, non-recovery of consumption value due to non-issuance of final order of allotment, under-assessment of consumption value against cooperative housing society. In all these cases, it has been clearly established that there has been a defect and reduction in the calculation of the amount at the government level and the department has also recovered them. If the Accountant General had not raised these objections, the department would not have taken any cognizance of it
It is a very serious matter that the government would have to lose such a huge revenue and it has been proved before the committee that the officials of the department are not aware of the revenue received by the government and are making this assessment very irresponsibly and negligently. The committee strongly disagrees.
But the Accountant General has not examined all the cases in the state during the audit, but only after examining certain cases under the sample, such serious issues have come to light. The Committee is of the clear view that in other such cases in the State also, the levy has been reduced in a similar manner. Therefore, not limiting the recovery to the objections of the Accountant General, the Department has to deal with all cases regarding the difference in the occupancy value of such allotted space through a special team.

The committee has recommended that the audit should be conducted in a time-bound manner and if there is a shortfall in the charge, it should be recovered and strict action should be taken against the concerned officer and the action taken report should be given to the committee within months. "
It is clear from the above details that the revenue of the Government has been lost due to faulty assessment of consumption value as well as due to lack of supervisory monitoring of any act in respect of such assessment.
However, in view of the above background and on the recommendation of the Public Accounts Committee, all the cases of occupancy value of the land so provided to all the Collectors should be audited by a special team in a time-bound manner and if there is a shortfall/ gap in the assessment, it should be recovered and strict action should be taken against the responsible officers concerned. Similarly, such audit should be done in a time bound manner.
