Government Resolution No: Land-2018/ PR No.92/ (Part-1)/ J-1A Madam Cama Marg, Hutatma Rajguru Chowk,
Ministry, Mumbai- 400 032.
Date: July 30, 2021
The Proposal:
As per the provisions of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, 1966, Maharashtra Land Revenue Rulebook (Volume-IV) Part-II Revenue Accounting System at Village Level in the State of Maharashtra, the Maharashtra Land Revenue Rights Records and Record Keeping (Preparation and Maintenance) Rules, 1971, various village samples and secondary registers have been prescribed for maintaining revenue accounts at village level in rural areas of the State. Of these, Village Sample No. 7 is for" Record of Rights" and Village Sample No. 12 This relates to keeping a record of crops. In the above mentioned rule book, in the cases under the heading Disclosure regarding G.No. 7-12 (Record of Rights and Register of Crops), the general instructions on this consolidated model as well as the procedure for taking entries in the Crop Register are mentioned. According to the present model no. The records of 12 crops are to be taken by the concerned Talathi and if the records are found to be wrong after the visit to the village, the authority to correct them is the Board Inspector or an officer senior to him.
Also, at present, the concerned Talathis in the" Crop Records" of GN No. 12 take the records of the crop sowing report.
With a view to collect real time crop sowing report data from the field level, and to provide farmers with access to crop sowing information through a mobile app in G.No.12, the Tata Trusts have developed a Farmer Friendly App to bring transparency in the collection of crop sowing data, active participation of farmers in the crop sowing reporting process, ease of access to agricultural credit, simplify the process of settling crop insurance and crop inspection claims, ensure accurate compensation and proper assistance in case of crop loss due to natural calamities, etc. Accordingly, using this command on a pilot basis in Mauje Karanjpada, Taluka Wada, District Palghar, the eager farmers adopted the new method of crop reporting by installing the app in their smart mobile phones. So, now through Tata Trusts.
