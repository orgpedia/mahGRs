Introduction: Nature tourism considering the economic opportunities and employment generation potential of the tourism sector
The Maharashtra Nature Tourism Development Board has been set up for balanced and coordinated implementation of development, enhancing livelihood opportunities of local villagers dependent on forest and promoting nature education.

In this work, private architect consultancy firms are appointed for the work of planning the project, preparing project reports, preparing budgets, and monitoring the project works after the project is approved. Instead of running a separate tender process for each project for such appointments, the best companies providing such services were appointed to the architectural advisory panel of the Maharashtra Natural Tourism Development Board.
Since the term of the said Advisory Panel has expired, the matter of appointing a new Vastu Shastra Advisory Panel was under consideration of the Government.
