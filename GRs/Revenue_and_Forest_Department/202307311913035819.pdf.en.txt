Preamble: Considering the very low availability of government land owned by the state government and the large demand and the increase in the price of land day by day, the government has directed all the collectors to ensure that the condition of reviewing the lease rate every 10 years is fixed while leasing the land under the relevant government circular.
The Government have issued Government Resolution No. Land-2505/ PR No.405/ J-2, dated 12/12/2012 and Govt. The policy has been prescribed under Land- 03/2013/ PR No. 155/ J1, dated 01/08/2019. The policy provides for revision of lease rates after 5 years of renewal of lease.
Therefore, with a view to maintain uniformity/ uniformity in the period of revision of lease rates, it was under the consideration of the Government to take a revised decision by superseding the said Government Circular dated 23/01/1989.
Government's decision:
Circular No. Land- 1088/222336/ (2162)/ C-9, dated 23/01/1989 is being encroached upon.
The land rent of the government land to be granted on lease for more than 5 years to individuals or institutions for various purposes should be revised every 5 years. While making such amendments in the land rent, the land rent should be fixed taking into account the market value of the land at that time and the concessional rate for the purpose at that time, if such land is given at a concessional rate. It should be ensured that the condition of such a thing is fixed in the land grant order henceforth.
