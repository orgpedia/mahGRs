Preamble: Since the Rehabilitation Act does not exist for pre-1976 irrigation projects in the state, such rehabilitated villages have been facilitated through the respective implementing agencies. However, with the introduction of the principle of "Rehabilitation First Then Dam" in the wake of the National Rehabilitation Policy in 2003, these works are being carried out by the Relief and Rehabilitation Sub-Branch under the Revenue and Forest Department since 2003. Accordingly, the Department of Relief and Rehabilitation vide Reference No. 1, D. By Government Decision dated 01/08/2009 and Reference No. 2, D. The Government Circular dated 28/03/2011 prescribes procedure B criteria for the civic amenities to be provided in the rehabilitated villages.
Accordingly, when proposals for urban amenities to be provided to villages affected by pre-1976 irrigation projects were submitted to the Planning and Finance Department, these departments had given feedback to transfer the proposal to the Rural Development Department.
The long-standing question of which administrative department should take responsibility for the provision of statutory support and funding for providing civic amenities to villages displaced by irrigation projects before 1976, 1986 and 1999 outside the purview of the State Rehabilitation Acts, has been resolved and the Dhadak Action Programme has been included in the special Yoo Days campaign of the Department of Relief and Rehabilitation.
03. Ma. The meeting was chaired by the Chief Minister. At the meetings held on 27/01/2025, as well as at Ma. The Deputy Chief Minister (Finance & Planning) chaired the meeting. The said subject was discussed in the meetings held on 22/01/2025 and the Department of Relief and Rehabilitation was directed to jointly complete the pending works of the backlog of civic amenities in the rehabilitated villages affected by the pre-1976 irrigation project and transfer these works to the Department of Rural Development for maintenance and repair.
Accordingly, the government was considering an action plan to provide incomplete civic amenities in the villages affected by the pre-1976 irrigation project.
