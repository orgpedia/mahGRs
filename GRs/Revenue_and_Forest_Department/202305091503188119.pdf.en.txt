The Maharashtra Minor Mineral Exploration (Development and Regulation) Rules, 2013
In exercise of the powers conferred by section 15 (1) (3) of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 (67 of 1950), the Government of Maharashtra have framed the Maharashtra Minor Mineral Exploration (Development and Regulation) Rules, 2013 and published the same in the Gazette dated 19.08.2013.
The Government of Maharashtra has made a provision in Rule 71 to 78 of the Maharashtra Minor Mineral Exploration (Development and Regulation) Rules, 2013, under Chapter VI, regarding obtaining a trading license for the storage and sale of minor minerals.
Unauthorised mining and transportation of minor minerals have been reported in the state. The permit for the quarry crusher unit is issued by the Regional Office under the Industries Department. However, since such stone crushers are not registered with the revenue department, it is not possible to check the quantity of stone used there. Therefore, with a view to prevent illegal quarrying and transportation and to avoid loss of revenue, it was under consideration of the Government to make it mandatory for stone crushers/ quarry crusher holders to obtain a trading license under the Maharashtra Minor Mineral Exploration (Development and Regulation) Rules, 2013.
The government has taken the following decisions:
Government Decision: As per the provisions of the Maharashtra Minor Mineral Exploration (Development and Regulation) Rules, 2013, the stone crusher/ quarry crusher holder shall proceed as follows for the issue of trade license and other ancillary matters.
(1) As per Rule 71 of the Maharashtra Minor Mineral Exploration (Development and Regulation) Rules, 2013, it shall be mandatory for every quarry crusher/ stone crusher holder to obtain a trading license.
