Introduction: With the reorganization of the offices of the Sub-Divisional Officers from the year 2013, the jurisdiction of one or two Taluks under one Sub-Divisional Officer Office has been fixed. The establishment of Talathi in Group-C is at the level of the Sub-Divisional Office and the proceedings regarding the establishment matters, point list, transfer etc. are at the level of the Sub-Divisional Officer.
can be done. After the reorganization of the offices of the Sub-Divisional Officers, the area of some sub-divisions has been fixed for one taluk. According to this, the Talathi has to work in only one Taluka for the full service period.
As it is mandatory to work in the full service period in the jurisdiction of only one or two talukas as mentioned above, there will be uniformity in work and innovation.
There is a lack of initiative. Similarly, many Talathis are trying to transfer outside the subdivision. However, the establishment at the sub-divisional level does not make it possible.
Therefore, if some Talathis want to move out of the subdivision due to the complexity of service quality, their service quality is lost. as well as various judicial
Cases are on the rise.
The recruitment process is being carried out at the district level.
If the establishment is kept at the district level, the Talathas can get an opportunity to work in different talukas throughout the district. The Talathi cadre employees will be motivated to work in an enterprising manner according to the different geographical, social and economic conditions in different taluks. Considering this, the matter of establishing the Talathi community at the district level was under the consideration of the government.
