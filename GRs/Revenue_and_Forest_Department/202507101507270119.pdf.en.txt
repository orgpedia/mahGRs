the Government Circular
The table of contents of the portfolios in the Revenue and Forest Departments is as under: No. 9, 2B3 has been published by the Government Circular mentioned herein. This table of contents has been amended from time to time by the relevant Government circulars for administrative reasons. However, it has been almost 10 years since the publication of the list. Changes in the structure of indirect taxes due to the Goods and Services Tax system, changes in the functioning of the department over time, etc., have necessitated changes in the functions and subjects of the department. The department receives references / references from other departments. There is also correspondence to the government from visitors from all over the state. As the names of the karyasana are not self-explanatory in such cases, the visitor does not get a definite understanding of the respective karyasana and this is a waste of time.
Accordingly, it is also necessary to make self-explanatory changes in the names of the offices of the department on the lines of the General Administration Department. In view of all the above, the re-design, name changes and sub-divisional-wise final agenda of the various offices of the Department is annexed as under.
