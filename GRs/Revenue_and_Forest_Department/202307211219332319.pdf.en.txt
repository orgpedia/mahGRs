Introduction: Government lands in the state are provided on lease or possession for various industrial/ commercial and residential, non-sporting, gymkhana etc. As per Rule 32 (2) of the Maharashtra Land Revenue (Disposal of Government Land) Rules, 1971, 50% of the land rent was to be levied on the leasehold land of a cooperative society. Following this, the government took decision:
The Maharashtra Land Revenue (Disposal of Government Land) Rules, 1971, provides for levy of 50% occupancy charge as per Rule 32 (2) of the Maharashtra Land Revenue (Disposal of Government Land) Rules, 1971, for granting land to cooperative societies (excluding cooperative housing societies and central cooperative banks) at concessional rate. Similarly, instead of charging lease rate on the entire valuation of the land provided/ done by the lessee, the ground rent should be charged accordingly taking into account 50% valuation.
