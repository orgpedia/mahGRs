The Proposal: -
Section 143 of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, 1966 provides for the grant of GAAS agricultural land. But when this law came into existence, agriculture was traditionally done with the help of bullock carts, bullock carts. However, at present, due to increasing mechanization in agriculture, agriculture is becoming more progressive and agricultural production is also changing. With increasing mechanization in agriculture, it is now common to use large farm implements. Conventional narrow pavement or unpaved carriageways are now becoming inadequate for the transport of large equipment, limiting the benefits of mechanization.
For example, large agricultural implements (e.g., land, land, etc.) can be used to provide farmers with the full benefits of modern agriculture. There has been a need to provide suitable width farmways instead of the traditional narrow farmways for faster and safer transportation of farm produce) for tractors, rotavators, STACs, etc.
According to Section 143 of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, 1966 and Section 5 of the Courts of Appeal Act, 1906, farmers have the right to a proper road to their fields. However, it has come to the notice of the government that since the records of these roads are not recorded in any authority register, issues like encroachment arise leading to disputes. Therefore, for effective utilization of these provisions and for real benefit to the farmers, existing and approved farm roads by the competent authority / authority need to be officially registered with other SAHAs under 7/12.
However, it was under the consideration of the Government to issue directions to the field officers / authorities regarding the following in order to positively respond to the above mentioned changes and ensure that the farmers get the full benefit of modern farming.
A. Providing farmlands of appropriate width instead of traditional narrow farmlands in line with increasing mechanization while proceeding under Section 143 of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, 1966.

b. Official registration of farm roads granted by the competent authority / authority under section 143 of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, 1966 as well as prohibitory orders under section 5 of the Appellate Courts Act, 1906 for removal of road obstructions on the stretch.
(c) the adjudication of the application within 90 days from the receipt of the application under section 143 of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, 1966 and section 5 of the Courts of Litigation Act, 1906.
Government Decision: - A. In pursuance of Section 143 of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, 1966, the competent authority / authority may provide for at least 3 to 4 metres wide farmlands instead of traditional narrow farmlands in line with the increasing mechanization of agriculture.
Section 143 of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, 1966 provides landowners the right to use their agricultural land for agricultural and allied purposes. This provision is very important in terms of land use in rural areas. This includes the road required to access the fields and transport farm goods. Traditional narrow footpaths or bullock cart routes are now used to transport large agricultural implements (e.g. tractors, rotavators, howisters, etc.) are becoming inadequate for their handling and for the fast and safe transport of farm produce. However, while taking action under Section 143 of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, 1966, the concerned field officer / authority shall take action as follows.
1. To provide farmers with the full benefits of modern agriculture, i.e., large agricultural implements (e.g.
For transportation of tractors, rotavators, havesters, etc.) and for faster and safer movement of farm produce, the farmer's demand and requirement regarding farm roads, local geographical conditions should be checked by the concerned competent authority / authority and at least 3 to 4 meters wide farm roads should be made available instead of traditional narrow farm roads.
2. The requirement of the farm land should be checked by physically inspecting the land area demanded by the farmer. The existing natural routes, footpaths, other recreational routes as well as the local topography should be examined. Neighbouring landlords should consider their rights to the estate and their objections to it. Considering these factors, if it is not possible for any reason to directly provide a suitable width VALET in line with the increasing mechanization, but if a wider field is required, other alternative and convenient ways should be considered, even if it is a little longer. And if that is also not possible, it should be made available only in exceptional circumstances, as much as possible to provide less than 3 to 4 meters but as much width of field as required.

3. Dams are not just the boundary of two farms, they are important for water management and to prevent soil erosion. Therefore, its natural form should be maintained as much as possible while giving way through the dam. The width of roads should be kept in line with increasing mechanization in agriculture, but unnecessary widening should be avoided. Also, the boundaries of both the sides should be demarcated after laying the road from the dam so that no dispute arises from the border in future.
b. regarding the official registration of other SAHA of 7/99 of farm roads sanctioned by the competent authority / authority under section 143 of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, 1966 as well as the HOA of the Court of Appeal Act, 1906 prohibiting the removal of blockage on 5 sister roads.
The registration of a farm road in the other SHHs of Uttar Pradesh will establish the legal validity of that road and help reduce the amount of land deeds in the future, as well as inform the prospective buyer of this important right to land at the time of land purchase and sale. For example, the following action should be taken by the concerned field officer / authority in connection with the registration of the farm road in the 7/12 Other Rights of Access.
1. While passing 5 orders by the competent authority under Section 143 of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, 1966 and Section 5 of the Courts of Litigants Act, 1906, the order stated that the farm road leading to the farm is located in Group No. / No. The width, length, direction, and boundary of the farmland should be clearly stated. Also specify the other rights of the 7/12 reference to be recorded in this section.
2. Other rights of way of registration of farm roads shall be taken in accordance with the order passed by the competent authority / authority in respect of farm roads passed under section 143 of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, 1966 as well as the injunction issued under section 5 of the Courts of Appeal Act, 1906 for removal of obstruction on the road of conveyance. It consists of the farm road leading to Group No. / No. , clearly state the width, length, direction, and boundary of the farm land, etc.
HOA 143 of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Act, 1966 and Section GWAC of the Courts of Litigants Act, 1906 with respect to passing of final order within 90 days from the receipt of the application on the application received.
The application under Section 143 of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, 1966 and Section 5 of the Courts of Litigation Act, 1906 shall be decided within 90 days from the receipt of the application. The concerned officer / authority should ensure that there is no delay. Further, as per the said provisions, all cases presently pending / pending before various Revenue Authorities / Authorities of the State shall be disposed of within 90 days from the date of issue of the said Government Decision.
