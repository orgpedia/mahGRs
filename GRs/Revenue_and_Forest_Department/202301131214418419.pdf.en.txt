In order to streamline and control the administration of the existing 11 Regional Forest Circles under the Forest Department in the State, guidelines have been issued vide Circular dated 14.07.2015 regarding appointment of a separate guardian Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forest for each Regional Forest Circle and the administrative work to be done by them.

It is to bring speed in governance by keeping a check on the administration. It is also intended that the parents of the Forest Circle-wise Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests will be able to understand the various issues related to the work of the Forest Circle and guide the concerned Chief Conservator of Forests accordingly without any delay and will help them in the work of this office. However, the officers of the rank of Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests are expected to advise the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Head of Forest Force) as the subject head for a particular subject related to the Forest Department and they are expected to provide uniform guidance to all the Regional Forest Circles. Accordingly, since the officers of the rank of Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests are busy in their day-to-day work, the Government does not find that the guardian Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests has guided on important issues such as legislative business, implementation of MGNREGA, complaints received from the people's representatives regarding the activities at the district/ forest circle level, implementation of policy matters such as taking action on the notification of reserved forests in a time-bound manner, completion of work after the approval given under the Forest Conservation Act, etc.
Accordingly, the procedure of appointment of Guardian Principal Chief Conservator of Forests/ Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests for Forest Records is hereby repealed vide this Circular dated 05/01/2023. Separate orders are being issued for the receipt/ review of confidential reports of the Chief Conservator of Forests/ Conservator of Forests and other Indian Forest Service officers in the respective Forest Circles.
