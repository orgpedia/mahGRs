Further, despite grant of non-agriculture permission/ development permission, there is no independent record of rights over roads, amenity areas, open spaces and developable plots leading to illegal transfer transactions and wrongful record of rights leading to legal complications.
To avoid this, instructions to carry out a campaign in this regard have been issued in a separate semi-government letter No. Sankirna-2022/ No. 584/ L-1, D. 08.12.2022 and D. 13.01.2023.
Accordingly, as per the provisions of the Land Acquisition Manual and Maharashtra Land Revenue Manual, in the case of a judgment in a land acquisition case and in all cases of non-agriculture and development permits, more or less sheets must be prepared and their implementation must be taken in the village sample number 7/12, group map and other relevant village samples.
In this regard, the number of pending cases should be fixed on the preparation of" less and more sheets" after reviewing the land acquisition and non-agriculture permission cases of all the districts and the process of updating all the maps and village samples should be completed by planning the action on it.
