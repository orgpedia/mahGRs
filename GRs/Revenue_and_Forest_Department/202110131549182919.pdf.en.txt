Preamble: The revenue of the village in the area of town assessed under section 126 of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Act, 1966 and the survey no. The group no. Includes the land.
As per the provisions of the Town Geo-assessment Manual and Section 126, the Town Geo-assessment Rules are applicable only to uncultivated land.

As per this provision, the process of preservation and preservation of records of rights does not take place in practice. Many questions have been raised. Because of the existence of the dual record system of records of rights, there is a mismatch between the records of records of rights and the records of receipts. Also, the cases of fraud are increasing by making transfer transactions on the basis of these two rights records. The proceedings of the town land survey including agricultural income in the area notified under section 122 of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Act, 1966 shall be carried out under section 126 and the revenue sheet shall be opened in respect of all income including agricultural land in the town land assessment area and the procedure for maintaining the income sheet, recovering the non-agricultural amount, performing the relevant duties and maintaining the registers shall be carried out by the Land Records Department or the authority in the town land assessment area may hand over these works to the Land Records Department as per the prevailing method of maintaining the records or submit a proposal to the Government considering the provisions of the Act and the Government Circulars and the difficulties faced in doing the actual work.
