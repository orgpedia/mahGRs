Whereas, in exercise of the powers, conferred under the Disaster Management Act 2005,
the undersigned, in his capacity as Chairperson, State Executive Committee has vide various
orders imposed restrictions in the State to break the chain of transmission of the COVID 19
virus from time to time;
And whereas the State Government is satisfied that the State of Maharashtra continues to
be threatened with the spread of COVID-19 virus; Semut

And whereas the state Government, in order to effectively respond to the Covid 19 pandemic has substantially upgraded medical facilities available in the state for the testing as well as treatment of Covid 19 disease and has substantially increased the number of hospital beds including oxygen supported beds;
And whereas in order to ensure that State as a whole has adequate reserves of oxygen to
cater to new Corona Cases, Oxygen as a resource is to be judiciously used at the state level to
ensure that no part of the state faces shortage of the same during times of need and thus if
oxygen requirement for the whole state for tackling Covid 19 patients is beyond a critical
percentage of its own total production capacity, none of the parts of state may be allowed to
relax restrictions and risk increase in numbers of infections;
And whereas various parts of the state are at various stages of infections and must
correspondingly have different severity of restrictions to 'break the chain';
And whereas some of the districts need to be divided into different administrative units
for the limited purpose of imposition of Covid restrictions, given administrative structures as
well as, to a large extent, self-contained nature of basic economic activities;
And whereas it is imperative that decisions about severity of restrictions must be taken
rationally on the basis of various parameters that might be considered as indicative of current
and future severity of the infection as well as probable cases that may arise in foreseeable
future for medical treatment as well as parameters that are indicative of availability and
adequacy of medical resources for treating these future cases and that may raise alarm at the
right time that the health system may be coming under duress and may get overwhelmed in
coming days;
And whereas it is also important that there is an appreciation in the public at large about
the reasons behind restrictions on economic activities so that their voluntary compliance may
be expected and also that citizens are aware that restrictions are needed due to existing scale
of pandemic so that their self-restrained behavior in compliance for Covid Appropriate
Behavior may also be expected and also that citizens may realize that if with collective
restrained and disciplined behavior they help to bring down the spread and thus allow more
social and economic transactions to be freed from constraints;
Now therefore the Government in exercise of the powers conferred under Section 2 of
the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, read with all other enabling provisions of The Disaster
Management Act, 2005, finds it is necessary to impose various levels of restrictions in
quenti

different parts of the State based on the conditions in each respective district/ administrative unit to not only break the chain of transmission effectively but also to commence disciplined restart of various economic and social activites without forgoing the gains achieved in
controlling the spread of Covid 19 infection through measures of restrictions.
In view of the above, following regulations are framed for effective measures of
restrictions for containment of Covid 19 pandemic, in various administrative units of the
State of Maharashtra.
I. Administrative Units:

form a separate single administrative unit.
C. DDMA may propose any contiguous area with common characteristics and
self-contained economic and social interactions, where the population is at least about one million, to be declared as a separate administrative unit for the limited purposes of this regulation, to CEO of State Disaster Management
Authority for final approval and declaration.
II. Levels of Restrictions:
There shall be five levels of restrictions for different classes/ categories of activities. These levels of restrictions shall be applied based on two

10. As far as reservation of oxygen production for medical purposes is concerned,
this shall be regulated by separate orders from time to time.
IV. State Level Oxygen Trigger: Government has taken note of the fact that medical
oxygen is the most critical resource for the treatment of Covid 19. Government
has further noted that the production capacity of State of Maharashtra is currently
1200 MT per Day and that there are serious difficulties in sourcing oxygen from
out of state sources as well as transporting oxygen to various remote parts of the state. Government is there satisfied that there exists a need to take measures to
contain the spread of the virus much before the number of patients requiring
oxygen based treatment overwhelms the state's oxygen production capacity.
Thus there must be a well quantified oxygen trigger that will be the basis for
level 3 and above restrictions across the state.
Given the state's current oxygen production capacity at 1200 MT per Day, as
indicated above, and the fact that typically, on an average 1000 Covid 19 patients
require 20 MT per Day, the maximum number of patients that can be supported
from the state production capacity is 60000. In view of the aforesaid, the
following oxygen trigger shall operate: Drink

# Page 14
A. If
I. total oxygen beds occupied are more than 45000 in whole of the
state with rising trend of oxygen beds occupancy or,
II. total oxygen beds occupied are more than 50000 irrespective of
the trend of oxygen beds occupancy,
then no part of the state, irrespective of other local parameters like Positivity
and Oxygen Bed Occupancy, shall be below level 4. This is to ensure that
Maharashtra state daily consumption of oxygen for medical treatment remains
within the daily production capacity of the state which is about 1200 MT and
may cater to about 60000 beds for Covid 19 patients.
B. If
I. total oxygen beds occupied are between 35,000 and 45000
irrespective of the trend of oxygen beds occupancy or
II. total oxygen beds occupancy between 45000 and 50000 with
reducing trend,
no part of the state shall be below level 3.
V. The operationalization of the above-mentioned levels of restrictions will be as follows
a. Every Thursday, Public Health Department of Government of Maharashtra will declare number of oxygen beds occupied at the state level, as well as positivity rate and oxygen beds occupation percentage in each district.
SDMA shall declare whether overarching condition stated in section IV exists.
b. The District Disaster Management Authority will, based on the above
mentioned parameters, after disaggregating these parameters for various administrative units in its jurisdiction, shall decide, subject to state level
oxygen trigger as per section IV, which level of restrictions should be
imposed in these administrative units, as per the guidelines contained herein.

c. The restrictions level, if there is any change, will come into effect from the

with local exigencies. However, such modifications shall be kept to the
minimum and shall be brought into force only with the concurrence of State
Disaster Management Authority.

The State Government vide its Order dated 4th June, 2021 has notified levels of restrictions to be imposed in various administrative units in different districts of the State, as per the COVID 19 positivity rate and the Oxygen Beds Occupancy in these administrative units.
Section IV of the said order defines the State Level Oxygen Trigger. As per the information received from the Public Health Department, the total number of oxygen beds occupied across the State are 31224 with a declining trend, as on 3rd June 2021. This number being less than 35000, State Level Oxygen Trigger does not get operated for the ensuing week.
Oxygen Bed Occupancy and Positivity Rates as on Thursday 3rd June, 2021 for various districts as informed by Public Health Department are attached herewith.
Based on the these figures, the districts/ administrative units may now decide which level of restrictions should be imposed in their respective administrative units as per the order dated 4th June, 2021. If a district has more than one administrative units then it should disaggregate and calculate these indicators for different administrative units and then decide.
The said orders may be issued by the respective Disaster Management Authorities at the earliest and the declared levels for each such unit to come into force from Monday, 7th June, 2021.
