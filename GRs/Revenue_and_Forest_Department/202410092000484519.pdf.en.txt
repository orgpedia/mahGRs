The Proposal: -
Read above Revised Service Admission Rules have been prescribed for the Naib Tehsildar cadre under the Notification No. 1. Rule 5 of the said Service Admission Rules provides that the ratio of appointment to the cadre of Naib Tehsildar by promotion and nomination shall be 67:33.
Similarly, Rule 4 (1) states that "the extent to which persons belonging to the cadre of Top Clerk and Board Officer shall be promoted shall be prescribed by the Government by executive order for each department after taking into account the number of employees belonging to the cadre concerned." Accordingly, for the six revenue divisions of the state, the ratio of posts to be filled by promotion from the two cadres of Top Clerk and Mandal Officer to the Naib Tehsildar cadre is read No. The governments at 2, 3, and 4 are determined from time to time by decision. Now, after 2014, the government was considering to review the posts in the top clerk and mandal officer cadre of the division and determine the proportion of posts to be filled by promotion from the two cadres of top clerk and mandal officer of the division to the deputy tehsildar cadre.
The Government's Decisions:
Read Revenue and Forest Department No. The Government has decided to revise the scale of promotion by revising the scale fixed for promotion of top clerks and employees of the Mandal Officers cadre to the Naib Tehsildar cadre under the Government Decisions 2, 3 and 4.
2. For the purpose of implementing the said Government Decision, the Government Decisions in the aforesaid Read No. 2, 3 and 4 are being superseded by this. Also, for all the six revenue divisions of the state, the proportion of posts to be filled by promotion from the top clerk in the Naib Tehsildar cadre and employees in the Mandal Officer cadre is being fixed as follows.
