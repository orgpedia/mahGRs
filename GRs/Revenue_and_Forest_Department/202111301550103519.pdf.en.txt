the order
Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 and Disaster Management Act, 2005.
The number of Covid-19 cases in the state has been on the rise in the last few weeks. Also, there has been a steady and continuous decline in the number of COVID-19 cases in the country and neighbouring states. All this has been achieved due to the discipline with which COVID-19 related restrictions are being followed by various establishments and the majority of the people are following COVID appropriate behaviour. The vaccination drive in the state and the country has also seen a massive response and has contributed to a major reduction in the strain on public and private health infrastructure. In view of the above, the State Government is now considering lifting the restrictions on economic, social, entertainment and cultural sectors for fully vaccinated persons.
Therefore, in exercise of the powers conferred under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, the undersigned, the Chairman, State Executive Committee of the State Disaster Management Authority, in exercise of his powers, superseding all the earlier orders of the State Government regarding the imposition of restrictions to contain the spread of COVID-19 virus, hereby orders with immediate effect that all economic, cultural, social, sports and entertainment activities shall be opened as per the normal timings prescribed by the various local or other competent authorities before the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, subject to the following conditions:
COVID Appropriate Behaviour: The COVID Appropriate Behaviour (CAB) as prescribed by the State Government and Central Government from time to time shall be strictly followed by all including service providers, owners of premises, licensees, organisers, etc. as well as all visitors, service takers, customers, guests, etc. The detailed guidelines of COVID appropriate behaviour as well as the penalties to be imposed for violation of the same shall be as per the guidelines of COVID appropriate behaviour and the penalties mentioned hereinafter.

For offices and other establishments where no person from the general public is visiting, as well as private transport services, they are also required to be fully vaccinated, although this is not a condition for them to be open to fully vaccinated persons.
