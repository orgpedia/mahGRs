Accordingly, it has been decided to provide subsidy@ 75% of the cost of solar fence per beneficiary or Rs. 15,000/- whichever is less, for providing the benefit of individual solar fencing in vulnerable villages. To implement this scheme, it was expected to procure and supply materials through e-tendering at the forest circle level. However, considering the difficulties in supplying materials through e-tendering and the time taken to provide the benefits of the scheme to the beneficiaries, the government was considering to improve the implementation of the scheme. Accordingly, the Government has decided to use the MahaDBT Portal for the transfer of subsidy through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) on the lines of Agriculture Department through Aadhaar Based Payment System (ABPS) to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries. 25/05/2022 was under consideration for supersession.
