192. Consequentially, when the challenge posed by the four applicants had
been rejected, the Tribunal could not have travelled beyond their prayers. Since we
have concluded that both the Transfer Applications of these four Applicants deserve
to be   rejected, the suggestions put forth by the Tribunal below paragraph No.87 and
the consequential order below paragraph No.88, deserve to be quashed. There was
no reason, in our view, for the learned Tribunal to make suggestions when the
impugned seniority list was not to be interfered with or set aside.
For this reason, Ma. The government's decision is valid in the order passed by the court.

According to the petition. The court On 08.08.2024, the following command was passed:
There are.
110. We agree with the view taken by the Tribunal that the very transition of
these 4 Applicants, from Tahsildars to promotee deputy Collectors, is an
irregularity. The seniority list dated 31.12.1998, has attained finality and there has
been no challenge to the same. The circular dated 29.06.2010 is a testimony of the
Page 6 of 252
# Page 7
Government Circular No: GIST-2024 / Q.61 / E-1 (A)
said seniority list being crystallized. This has also been reiterated in the impugned
seniority list vide paragraph Nos.8.1 and 8.2. Paragraph Nos.11 and 20 of the
affidavit in reply of the State Government before the Tribunal, crystallized the said
issue. In the light of the same, the impugned final seniority has been settled. The
grievance of these 4 Applicants is, therefore, baseless and does not deserve
consideration. Except these 4, all other PDCs have accepted the impugned seniority
list.
111. We need to consider another angle, as to whether the Tribunal could
have made suggestions and issued directions, when it had come to a conclusion that
both the Applications deserved to the rejected. Once the Tribunal came to a
conclusion that the grievance of the 4 Applicants is unsustainable, it should not
have travelled any further as their applications deserved no_ consideration.
Therefore, issuing guidelines and suggestions, was unwarranted, more so, when all
those who would be affected by such suggestions or directions, were not before the
Tribunal.
112. Consequentially, when the challenge posed by the four Applicants had
been rejected, the Tribunal could not have travelled beyond their prayers. Since we
have concluded that both the Transfer Applications of these four Applicants deserve
to be   rejected, the suggestions put forth by the Tribunal below paragraph No.87 and
the consequential order below paragraph No.88, deserve to be quashed. There was
no reason, in our view, for the learned Tribunal to make suggestions when the
impugned seniority list was not to be interfered with or set aside.
113. The law is clearly laid down in Kusum Ingots and Alloys Limited vs.
Union of India and another, 2004 (6) SCC 254, Jotun India Private Limited vs
Union of India and others, 2018 SCC Online Bombay 6400 and United Forum and
others vs The Union of India and others, 2018 SCC Online Bombay 2221, that the
Court should decide an issue if there is a cause of action and should refrain from
taking up an issue which is purely academic in nature.
114. In view of our conclusions in this judgment and as both the Transfer
Applications fail, we have no reason to deal with the other contentions made by the
private parties/ Petitioners before us. The grievance of these four Applicants as
against the impugned seniority list dated 21.12.2020, is unsustainable. Both the
Transfer Applications, on this ground, deserve to be dismissed.
115. Writ Petition Nos.11692/2022 and 11762/2022, filed by the State, are
allowed. Accordingly, the two Transfer Applications stand dismissed.
Consequentially, the suggestions/ directions issued by the learned Tribunal in
paragraph Nos. 87 and 88, are quashed and set aside. Rule is made absolute in these
two petitions.

Government Circular No: GIST-2024 / Q.61 / E-1 (A)
116. In view of the above analysis and our conclusions, Writ Petition
No. 12699/2022, filed by Mr. Nitin Mahajan v/s State of Maharashtra and others,
does not deserve consideration. Moreover, with our conclusions recorded above, no
purpose would be served in entertaining this Petition. Therefore, Writ Petition
No.12699/2022, stands disposed off. Rule is discharged in this petition.
117. In view of the above, Writ Petition No.9163/2022 (filed by Samiksha
Ramakant Chandrakar and another), Writ Petition No.9631/2022 (filed by
Vijaysingh Shankarrao Deshmukh), Writ Petition No.9632/2022 (filed by Tushar
Eknath Thombre), and Writ Petition No.12675/2022 (filed by K. K.
Suryakrishnamurty), are dismissed. Rule is discharged in these four petitions.
118. After this judgment was pronounced, the learned Senior Advocate Shri
Rajadhyaksha, representing the Petitioner in Writ Petition No. 12699/2022, Shri
Ajay S. Deshpande, the learned Advocate representing the Petitioners in Writ
Petition No. 9163/2022 and Shri Avinash S. Deshmukh, the learned Advocate,
representing Respondent No.3 and 4 in Writ Petition No. 9632/2022 and
Respondent No.1 and 2 in Writ Petition No.11692/2022, prayed for staying the
operation of this judgment.
119. The learned Senior Advocate Shri R.S. Apte, representing the State of
Maharashtra as a Special Counsel along with the learned Senior Advocate Shri P.R.
Katneshwarkar and the learned Senior Advocate Shri V.D. Sapkal, submit that the
Original Applications (Transfer Application Nos.1/2021 and 2/2021), were
dismissed by the learned Maharashtra Administrative Tribunal vide the impugned
judgment dated 26.08.2022. There has been no protective order passed by the
learned tribunal thereafter. When the parties reached this court. These are the petitions,
there was no interim order operating. At the same time, the judgment of the learned
Tribunal impugned in these petitions, was also not stayed.
120. The learned Senior Advocate Shri Rajadhyaksha and the learned
Advocate Shri Deshpande, raised a question as to why did the State not issue any
orders of promotion when there were no prohibitory orders from this Court. In our
view, this question cannot be posed to the Court. It is between the parties and the
State. This Court had never passed any order in the nature of either staying the
judgment of the Tribunal or injuncting the State Government from issuing
promotion orders.
121. In fact, the learned Senior Advocate Shri Apte had suggested before this
Court on 31.01.2024 that any further development that may take place with regard
to the promotions of eligible candidates, can be made subject to the result of these
petitions. In short, neither the judgment of the learned Tribunal dismissing the
Original Applications, was kept in abeyance, nor had this Court issued any
injunctory order. We have not issued any order or direction to any of the parties

before us. We have only upheld the verdict of the Tribunal, which had dismissed
the 2 proceedings before it. Hence, no orders.

4. In the impugned judgment, the Division Bench adverted to the Maharashtra
Deputy Collectors (Recruitment, Fixation of Seniority and Confirmation) Rules,
1977 (for short, the "Rules") and noted that the promotions were given promotion
only on temporary basis and such promotion were made subject to the approval of
the Maharashtra Public Service Commission. The High Court also accounted the
quota available for the promotees and noticed that the promotion was way beyond
the earmarked quota for the promotes, provided under the Rules. Admittedly, the
approval of the Public Service Commission was never obtained for regularising the
promotion. The Division Bench also found that promotion of the promotees were
made de hors the procedure prescribed in the Rules and 1t was made hurriedly.
5. In the seniority dispute, the High Court clearly noticed the illegal mode of
entry for the promotees. Also, vacancies were not available for their legitimate
entry into the cadre. Moreover, there was no concurrence of the Public Service
Commission. The promotions were in excess of the quota provided for the
promotees.
6. The petitioner has raised the contention that inter-se seniority should be
determined on the basis of continuous length of service as provided under Rule
13(5) of the Rules. This might be acceptable only if induction into the cadre was
Made in accord with the rules. The temporary promotion as can be seen was 2
hurriedly made just before the direct recruits were inducted into the cadre. Due
process as envisaged by the Rules was not followed for making the promotion. This
was a fortuitous promotion which does not confer seniority right, only by virtue of
service. The promotions were never approved by the MPSC. Moreover, the order
itself reflected that the promotees can have no seniority claim by such fortuitous
promotion.
7. Having considered the above and the other reasonings of the Division
Bench in the impugned judgment, the Special Leave Petition is found devoid of

merit. The same is accordingly dismissed. But the State 15 bound down to their
assurance to not to revert back the concerned promotees despite the irregularities in
their promotion de-hors the Rules, notwithstanding the present order in the SLP.
