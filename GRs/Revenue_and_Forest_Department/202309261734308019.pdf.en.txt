The Proposal:
In case of loss of crop or orchard due to wild animals like wild boar, deer (Sarang and Kurang), wild dog, rohi (Nilgai), monkeys, monkeys, monkeys and wild elephants in the State, the amount of compensation is paid to the concerned as per the provisions of the relevant Government Decisions dated 02.07.2010, 05.09.2013, 25.11.2013, 09.07.2015, 28.09.2015 and 23.112.2015.
The amount of compensation for the loss of fruit trees caused by wild animals has not been increased for the last seven years. As a result, farmers are suffering severely. Considering the demand from the local people's representatives to increase the amount of fruit tree compensation, the matter of increasing the amount of fruit tree compensation by wild animals was under the consideration of the government.
Government's decision:
In case of loss of fruit trees due to wild animals like wild boar, deer (Sarang and Kurang), wild dog, rohi (Nilgai), monkey, monkey and wild elephant, the following assistance should be provided:
