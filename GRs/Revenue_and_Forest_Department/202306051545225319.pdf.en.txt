As per the National Forest Policy, 1988, 33% of the total geographical area of the country should be under forest cover. Currently, only about 20 percent of the state's land area is under forest cover. In fact, the area under forest is rich in biodiversity and the need of the hour is to reforest the degraded forest areas to nurture it. In 1999, the Central Government had issued guidelines for reforestation of degraded forest area by entering into a tripartite agreement with the help of industrial societies and registered non-governmental organizations under the technical guidance of the Forest Department. As per the guidelines issued by the Central Government, to achieve the target of 33% forest cover as specified in the National Forest Policy, 1988, the Industrial Establishments, Government and Non-Government Organizations/ Eco Task Force Battalions are required to be constituted.

Policy and procedure for entering into Tripartite Agreements by way of Decisions/ Government Letters/ Government Circulars
has been determined. Similarly, a regional committee and a high-powered committee have been formed to take decisions in accordance with the proposal of the tripartite agreement. In order to harmonize these criteria, the relevant government decisions, government letters and government circulars should be compiled comprehensively.
The government was contemplating to bring in a new policy.
Government Decision To achieve the target of 33% forest cover as defined in the National Forest Policy 1988, under the technical guidance of the Forest Department, the Companies Act, 1955/ Banking Act, 1949
In pursuance of the tripartite agreement for reforestation of degraded forest area by the participation of registered societies, non-governmental organizations/ Eco Task Force Battalion/ Joint Forest Management Committee/ Eco Development Committee under the Societies Registration Act/ Mumbai Public Trust Act, the following comprehensive revised criteria are being prescribed.
