Government Decision Number: Stamp-2023 / Q.342 / M-1 (Policy)
The total number of applications / cases received till 30.9.2024 is 81,809. Out of these, the total amount of Stamp Duty B penalty collected by the Government is Rs. 509.61 lakh 88 thousand 264 in 41,085 cases. The remaining 13,566 would also provide relief to the citizens by way of revenue accrual to the government by giving one month's time for payment of the amount to the parties who have applied within the prescribed time frame but could not deposit the stamp duty B penalty amount due to various reasons mentioned above.
Also, there will be a reduction in the number of claims under the Abhay scheme by reducing the number of pending cases. So
It will save the time and effort of the administration and the citizens.
In view of all these factors, the Government was considering giving one month's time for payment of Stamp Duty B penalty for availing Stamp Duty Abhay Scheme-2023 to the parties who have filed their returns under the Abhay Scheme within the stipulated period but due to some technical reasons, the amount of the invoice has not been deposited by the Government within the stipulated period.
The Government's Decisions:
The benefit of the scheme "Maharashtra Stamp Duty Abhyay Yojana 20223" is for the purpose of depositing the stuck stamp duty revenue into the state exchequer with the maximum number of parties executing the document and the maximum number of them in the said scheme for the benefit of the people of urban and rural areas of the state.
In lieu of greater participation, this Government decision approves grant of a period of one month from 21st July, 2025 to 20th August, 2025 as a "special case" for payment of Stamp Duty B penalty by way of invoice to the parties who have applied for the said Public Interest Scheme of the State Government within the prescribed time frame but due to certain technical reasons, the amount of the invoice has not been deposited by the Government within the prescribed time frame.
