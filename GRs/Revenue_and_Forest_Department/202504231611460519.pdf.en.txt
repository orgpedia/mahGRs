The observations recorded in 21 are as follows: -
Z1. Therefore, in the larger public interest, we are inclined to issue the following directions, in addition to the directives issued by this Court in Redirections in the matter of demolition of structures (supra):
(1) While issuing the building planning permission, an undertaking shall be obtained from the builder / applicant, as the case may be, to the effect that possession of the building shall be entrusted and / or handed over to the owners / owners only after retaining completion / occupation certificate from the authorities concerned.

Government Circular No: Narrow-2 025 / P.No.19 / M-6
(ii) The builder / developer / owner shall cause (80 be
displayed at the construction site, a copy of the approved
plan during the entire period of construction and _ the
authorities concerned shall inspect the premises periodically
and maintain a record of such inspection in their official
records.
(7717) Upon conducting personal inspection and being
satisfied that the building is constructed in accordance with
the building planning permission given and there is no
deviation in such construction in any manner, the completion/occupation certificate in respect of residential
/ commercial building, be issued by the authority concerned
to the parties concerned, without causing undue delay. If any
deviation is noticed, action must be taken in accordance with
the Act and the process of issuance of completion/occupation
certificate should be deferred, unless and until the
deviations pointed out are completely rectified.
(iv) All the necessary service connections, such as,
Flectricity, water supply, sewerage connection, etc., shall
be given by the service provider/ Board to the buildings only
after the production of the completion/occupation
certificate.
(v) Even after issuance of completion certificate,
deviation/violation if any contrary to the planning
permission brought to the notice of the authority immediate
steps be taken by the said authority concerned, in accordance
with law, against the builder/owner/occupant; and _ the
official, who is responsible for issuance of wrongful
completion /occupation certificate shall be proceeded
departmentally forthwith.
(vi) No permission licence to conduct any business/trade
must be given by any authorities including local bodies of States Union Territories in any unauthorized building
irrespective of it being residential or commercial building.
(vil) The development must be in conformity with the zonal
plan and usage. Any modification to such zonal plan and usage
must be taken by strictly following the rules in place and in
consideration of the larger public interest and the impact on
the environment.
(5777) Whenever any request is made by the respective
authority under the planning department/local body for co-
operation from another department to take action against any
unauthorized construction, the latter shall render immediate

assistance and co-operation and any delay or dereliction would be viewed seriously. The States/UT must also take disciplinary
action against the erring officials once it is brought to
their knowledge.
(ix) In the event of any application / appeal / revision being filed by the owner or builder against the non-issuance
of completion certificate Or for regularisation of
unauthorised construction or rectification of deviation etc.,
the same shall be disposed of by the authority concerned,
including the pending appeals/revisions, as expeditiously as
possible, in any event not later than 90 days as statutorily
provided.
(x) If the authorities strictly adhere to the earlier
directions issued by this court and those being passed today,
they would have deterrent effect and the quantum of litigation
before the Tribunal Courts relating to house / building
constructions would come down drastically. Hence, necessary instructions should be issued by all the State/UT Governments
in the form of Circular to all concerned with a warning that
all directions must be scrupulously followed and failure to
do so will be viewed seriously, with departmental action being
initiated against the erring officials as per law.
(x1) Banks/financial institutions shall sanction loan
against any building as a security only after verifying the completion/occupation certificate issued to a building on
production of the same by the parties concerned.
(X11) The violation of any of the directions would lead to
initiation of contempt proceedings in addition to the prosecution
under the respective laws.
b) Ma. The Civil Appeal No. 14604/2024 FT 14605/2024
(Mr. Rajendra Kumar Barjatya and others v. UP Housing and Development Council and Rajiv Gupta v. Others)
UP Housing and Development Council), the apex court said. By command of 17.12.2024
The observations made and given in paragraphs 90 to 94 in connection with the eviction of unauthorised constructions.
The instructions are as follows: -
90. In order to allay the fears in the minds of the citizens
with regard to arbitrary exercise of power by the officers/officials of the State, we find it necessary to issue certain directions in exercise of our power under Article 142 of the Constitution. We are also of the view that even after orders
Page 3 of 7
# Page 4
Government Circular No: Narrow-2 025 / P.No.19 / M-6
of demolition are passed, the affected party needs to be given
some time so as to challenge the order of demolition before an
appropriate forum. We are further of the view that even in cases
of persons who do not wish to contest the demolition order,
sufficient time needs to be given to them to vacate and arrange
their affairs. It is not a happy sight to see women, children and
aged persons dragged to the streets overnight. Heavens would not
fall on the authorities if they hold their hands for some period.
91. At the outset, we clarify that these directions will not
be applicable if there is an unauthorized structure in any public
place such as road, street, footpath, abutting railway line or
any river body or water bodies and also to cases where there is
an order for demolition made by a Court of law.

and also assign an email address and communicate the same to
