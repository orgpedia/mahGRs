The Proposal:
As per the Drought Management Code, 2016, a detailed methodology has been prescribed under the relevant Government Decisions No. 1 and 2 for assessing the drought situation in the State. The second wave of drought has been imposed in 43 talukas of the state based on the situation in the Kharif 2023 season as per the criteria prescribed in the government decision and the drought management code. Of the 43 taluks where the second wave of drought has hit, the question of declaring drought does not arise as the sowing area in Ulhasnagar taluka is different. Ground truthing has been done in the remaining 42 taluks and based on the proposal received from the State Level Drought Monitoring Committee, the government was considering declaring drought in the taluks of the state.
Government's decision:
Taking into account the factors such as rainfall deficit, availability of groundwater, remote sensing parameters, vegetation index, soft moisture content, area under sowing and crop condition for the period from June to September, the State Government is declaring severe drought in 24 talukas and moderate drought in 16 talukas of 15 districts.
The following relaxations are being approved by the Government in the 40 taluks where drought is being declared:
1) Reduction in land revenue.
2) Restructuring of crop loans.
3) Restriction on repayment of loans.
33.5% discount on the current electricity bill of the agricultural pump.
5) Exemption in examination fees for school/ college students.

6) Relaxation in work norms under ROHYO to some extent.
7) Use of tankers to provide drinking water wherever required.
8) Not to disconnect the power connection of the agricultural pump of the farmers in the village where the shortage has been declared.
The financial burden of various concessions to be given under this order should be borne by the concerned administrative departments and for this the finance department should provide the necessary funds. Accordingly, a compliance report should be submitted to the department on the next action taken in this case.
4. Tentative grant for agricultural assistance to the account holders of the said taluk shall be admissible. This subsidy will be available to those farmers who have produced dry crops and suffered more than 33 per cent loss. The procedure prescribed in the provision of Government Decision Revenue and Forest Department, dated 18.10.2023 should be followed while selecting the beneficiaries for the grant. The rates and other terms and conditions of the subsidy shall be as specified in the Government Resolution, Department of Revenue and Forest, No: CLS-2022/ PR No.349/ M-3, dated 27th March, 2023. Also, it should be ensured that the subsidy is limited to the area where the actual crop has been sown.
The allocation of this assistance should be made on the basis of the record of crops in the Kharif season of 2023 7/12.
6. 33% loss of dryland crops to be determined on the basis of crop-wise payment made after the crop harvesting experiment for the last payment of the season. Assistance will also be available to dryland crops which are not major crops and where harvesting is not being done.
7. The loss of more than 33 per cent of multi-year fruit and horticultural crops should be assessed by conducting farm-wise panchnamas.
8. The criterion for determining the loss of perennial and horticultural crops shall be the entry in 7/12.
The panchnama will be the criterion for determining the severity of the damage. For determining the loss of perennial crops and horticultural crops, it should be recorded in 7/12.
Any objections raised regarding the record of crop inspection in the Kharif season of 2023 in the 7/12 section should be resolved as per the provisions of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code.
10. The mid-day meal scheme should be implemented in schools in taluks where drought has been declared, even during long holidays. The children will also be provided mid-day meals under the Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS).
