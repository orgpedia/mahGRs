(2) The Office of the Commissioner M-11 shall forthwith disburse the funds as per the above and as per the annexure attached to this Government Resolution to the Divisional Commissioner on the BEAMS system.
(3) The guidelines and norms of all Government decisions in this regard shall be strictly followed while spending the said funds. The enhanced rates of assistance have been approved under the Government decision dated 21.10.2021 at Reference No. 2. Out of the increased rate, the amount disbursed under the head of State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) should be spent for providing assistance at the rate decided by the government at State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) reference number 1 and 3 and the difference between the increased sanctioned rate minus the rate of State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) should be shared with the fund disbursed from the State Government's fund. The funds will be utilised for the purpose for which they were sanctioned.
4. Beneficiaries to be determined after conducting the panchnama. All the district collectors should ensure that there is no need for assistance for crop loss in the same area for the current Kharif season. Although the entire amount is being disbursed on the BeAMS system under this government decision, after the beneficiary is identified, the concerned collector should be careful from the point of view of financial discipline to draw the amount from the treasury as per the actual need and then transfer the amount directly to the bank account of the beneficiaries through online mode. The bank is unnecessarily draining the funds from the treasury.

(5) The accounts of the expenditure made out of the Fund shall be maintained at the level of the Office drawing up the Fund and the expenditure made shall be reconciled quarterly with the Treasury Offices and the Accountant General's Office. The Divisional Commissioner will be responsible for submitting the utilization certificates of the fund to the government immediately after the above funds made available from the State Disaster Response Fund and the State Government Fund are spent.
