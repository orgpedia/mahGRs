Government's decision:
Department of Finance, Government Circular No.- Designation 0617/ PR No.8/ VISU-1, Dy. As per the guidelines dated June 29, 2017, all the posts in the department have been reviewed and the revised pattern of posts in the department has been approved. The posts include those of driver and constable and the deceased have been categorised as dead. However, since the services of these posts are to be made available through an external mechanism, the revised figure of total 521 posts of 448+73 is being approved as follows.
A total of 448 regular posts in various cadres for the Revenue and Forest Department (itself) and 73 posts to be made available through external mechanism for the purpose of Drivers and Constables are being approved.
The details in this regard will be as per the prospectus attached with this government decision.
(b) Since the cadre of Drivers and Constables in the prevailing figure has been declared as dead cadre, the existing posts in this cadre are being counted as superannuated posts. The working posts in this cadre will continue till the retirement of the concerned employee, after which the posts will automatically lapse. Details in this regard will be as per the prospectus attached with this Government Resolution.
