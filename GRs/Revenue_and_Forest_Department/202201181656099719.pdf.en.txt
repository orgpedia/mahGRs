Read- 1.Sasan Circular, Revenue and Forest Department, No.Land-2019/ PR No. 179/ J-1A, dated 13/9/2019
2. m. The High Court of Bombay at Writ Petition No. 5046/2021 dated 7/9/2021
The Proposal- M. The High Court of Bombay, in the case of Writ Petition No. 5046/ 2021 vide order dated 07/09/2021, vide circular dated 06/01/2010 of the Collector, Pune and circular dated 15/12/2010 of the Divisional Commissioner, Pune, has been ordered to issue detailed consolidated instructions at the State level in pursuance of the proceedings being carried out by the Revenue Officers at the field level. Also, in one case. During the hearing, Minister of State (Finance) and Orders in quasi-judicial matters from the Minister of State (Revenue) have also been ordered to be communicated to the field offices through the department on a regular basis.
While implementing the judgments in some of the cases, it has been observed that most of the time after the final outcome of the appeal/ revision, the matter is implemented well before the next appeal deadline. This leads to legal complications.
Also, the parties concerned have to face financial, mental stress and the image of the revenue department is also damaged.
Therefore, in order to ensure transparency and orderliness in all the semi-judicial activities at the field level, in view of the existing procedures at the field level, the matter of giving instructions to the revenue authorities and officials to take action in all the semi-judicial matters was under the consideration of the government.
In view of the existing procedures at the field level to ensure transparency and orderliness in the functioning of the semi-judicial bodies, as per the powers conferred under the provisions of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, 1966 and the Maharashtra Land Revenue Rights Records and Record-keeping (Preparation and Maintenance) Rules, 1971, all the revenue authorities and officers are hereby instructed to take action in semi-judicial matters as follows:

Government Circular No.: JUSTICE-2021/ PR No. 116/ J-1A
(1) In the case of quasi-judicial proceedings, the same shall be published on the website of the Government eqjcourts.gov.in on the day or the date on which the final order/ stay order is passed.
2) Whenever a new case is filed, it will be necessary to take the mobile number of the concerned party, lawyer and upload it on the government's website" eqjcourts. gov. in" so that they can get an idea about the order when the case is finally decided. This will facilitate the parties concerned to take further action on the order issued by taking a copy of the judgment immediately.
(3) The order shall be enforced in the case only after the expiry of the permissible period of appeal after the appeal/ revision/ reconsideration order is issued so that there is no further complication in the case. However, it shall be mandatory to implement the quasi judicial order in the manner in which the quasi judicial orders contain specific instructions regarding the implementation of the orders.
In quasi-judicial proceedings, most of the cases are partly approved by the higher authorities and referred to the lower courts for further investigation. But in case of such cases, it is not verified whether the revision has taken place within the given period or not. Therefore, such cases remain pending for review for years and the parties do not get immediate justice. For this, all the revenue authorities and officers need to constantly follow up such cases in accordance with the orders passed from their level.
5) Ma. Minister of State (Revenue) Suspension orders or interim or final orders issued in quasi-judicial matters at the level of Minister of State (Revenue) shall be implemented only after due intimation to the field offices by the concerned offices of the department.
