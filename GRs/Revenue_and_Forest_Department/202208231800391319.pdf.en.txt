Reference:- Letter from the Office of the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Personnel), Maharashtra State, Nagpur No.
Room-9/ Complex/ Process.3 (16-17)/ 457/22-23, Dy. 7.3.2022 and D. 10.6.2022 Preamble: The office of the Deputy Conservator of Forests, Nandurbar Forest Division is presently located at Shahada, about 40 km from Nandurbar. Therefore, it is becoming difficult to coordinate with all district level government offices for government scheme programs.
Last year, due to heavy rains in Shahada after Cyclone Gulab, the residence and office premises of the officers/ employees of the Nandurbar Forest Department, Shahada, were flooded. The Deputy Conservator of Forests and other officials have to travel frequently from Shahada to Nandurbar for various meetings at the district level. Since it is administratively convenient to control the operations from Nandurbar for forest protection, forest management and forest conservation, the matter of shifting the office of the Deputy Conservator of Forests, Nandurbar Forest Division from Shahada to Nandurbar was under consideration of the Government.
Government Decision: The Government has decided to shift the office of the Deputy Conservator of Forests, Nandurbar Forest Division, located at Shahada, to Nandurbar district.
The office of the Deputy Conservator of Forests, Nandurbar Forest Division should be started in the vacant building of the office of the Maharashtra Forest Development Corporation, Internal Divisional Manager Forest Project Division, Nandurbar.
The Government is approving one-time payment of the amount of transfer travel allowance to the warehouse material transporters and officers/ employees due to the shifting of the office.
The government should immediately implement the decision.
This decision was taken by the Finance Department in its Informal Reference No. Rs 220/-. being issued pursuant to the consent given under 03.08.2022.
