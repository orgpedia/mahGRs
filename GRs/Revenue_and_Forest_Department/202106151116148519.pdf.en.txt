ORDER
Reference:
1. The Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897.
2. The Disaster Management Act, 2005 3. Revenue and Forest, Disaster Management, Relief and Rehabilitation Department Order No. DMU-2020/C.R.92/DMU-I, dated 4th June, 2021.
The State Government vide its Order dated 4th June, 2021 has notified levels of restrictions to be imposed in various administrative units in different districts of the State, as per the COVID 19 positivity rate and the Oxygen Beds Occupancy in these administrative units.
Section IV of the said order defines the State Level Oxygen Trigger. As per the information received from the Public Health Department, the total number of oxygen beds occupied across the State is 20,697 with a declining trend, as on 10th June 2021. This number being less than 35000, State Level Oxygen Trigger does not get operated for the ensuing week.
Oxygen Bed Occupancy and Positivity Rates as on Thursday 10th June, 2021 for various districts as informed by Public Health Department are attached herewith. Based on these figures, the DDMA may now decide which level of restrictions should be imposed in their respective administrative units as per the order dated 4th June, 2021. If a district has more than one administrative unit, then it should disaggregate and calculate these indicators for different administrative units and then decide.
Section VI of the said order allows DDMA to modify restrictions relating to various activities mentioned therein, with the concurrence of the SDMA. If the basic level does not change and there is no change in modifications to restrictions as per current order in force, then there is no need to take revised permissions for these modifications. If there is any change in the level and modifications are proposed to restrictions as per new level or if level doesn't change but restrictions imposed are being modified, prior concurrence must be taken. Needless to say, if any level is being imposed without any modifications, no concurrence is required.
The said orders may be issued by the respective Disaster Management Authorities at the earliest and the declared levels for each such unit to come into force from Monday, 14th June, 2021.
