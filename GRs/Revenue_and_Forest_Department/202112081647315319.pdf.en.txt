The Proposal:
The procedure for sanction of Subsidiary Grants has been laid down under Annexure- 22 of Rule 149 of the Bombay Finance Rules, 1959. The Finance Department has also issued instructions regarding utilization certificates through relevant government circulars from time to time in this regard. The grant in aid sanctioned is to be spent within one year and if any funds remain unutilized, the amount is to be returned to the government accounts and the remaining funds are to be submitted in the prescribed format to the Accountant General Mumbai/ Nagpur/ Accounts and Accounts Officer, Mumbai.
The Comptroller and Auditor General of India in its Report on State Finances dated 31.3.2019 titled" Non-submission/ Delay in Submission of Utilization Certificates" (Para No. 3.1) has noted that a total of 944 Utilization Certificates are pending with the Department of Revenue and Forest. The non-submission of utilization certificates is not a proper regulation of the department on the utilization of funds sanctioned for a particular purpose and there is no certainty that the funds have been utilized for the purpose for which the Legislature has approved for the financial year.
