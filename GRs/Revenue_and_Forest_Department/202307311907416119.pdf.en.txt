Reference: 1. Government Decision, Revenue and Forest Department No. LRF- 1083/71134/ CR-3478/ G-6, dated 8.2.1983. LRF- 1083/1496/ CR-3700/ G-6, dated 11.5.1984. LRF-1093/ Q.No.61/ J-1, dated 20.7.1995
The Proposal:
The policy regarding allotment of government land for primary and secondary educational purposes in the state has been prescribed under the provisions of Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, 1966 and Maharashtra Land Revenue (Disposal of Government Lands) Rules, 1971 vide Government Resolution, dated 8/2/1983, dated 11/5/1984. As per this policy, the market value of the land as on 1/2/1976 is taken into account. It has been a long time since this policy was decided and in the meantime, the price of land has increased significantly.
The rates of concession/ lease to be charged at the time of grant of Government land to colleges and higher secondary schools and junior colleges have been revised as per the Government decision in references (3) and (4). However, this policy has also taken a long time and in the meantime, the price of land has increased significantly.
Hence, the Government has decided to provide land for primary and secondary education purposes as well as for colleges, higher secondary schools and junior colleges.

Government Resolution No: Land- 2621/ PR No. 03/ J-3, dated 31st July, 2023 The matter of revision of the concessional price/ lease rate to be levied was under consideration of the Government.
Since there is no provision in the existing policy of the government regarding the rates to be charged for sanctioning government land for pre-primary education, the matter of fixing the rates was also under consideration of the government.

Further, since the use of educational purpose is a public use and it helps in social upliftment, the matter of regularisation of encroachments on government land up to the date of January 1, 2015 for educational purpose was also under consideration of the Government as per the provisions of the Maharashtra Land Revenue (Disposal of Government Land) Rules, 1971 framed under the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, 1966.

GOVERNMENT DECISION NO. 2621/ PR. NO. 03/ J-3, dated 31st July, 2023, if Government land has been provided or any institution has been provided Government land for higher education as per this Government decision, in such a case, if there is a change in the purpose of use from one branch of higher education to another branch of higher education or if there is an increase in the scope of use of higher education itself, (e.g. The Collector shall be competent to modify the purpose of such use (i) use the land allotted for an engineering college for a medical college or (ii) start a medical college with engineering etc.). Also, since the land is being used only for the basic purpose of higher education, no additional surcharge or amount is required to be charged for it.
However, if there is a change in the above mentioned purpose without prior approval, a surcharge of 1% on the amount of prevailing market value of the land should be levied.
Since the use of educational purpose is a public use and it helps in social upliftment, as per the provisions of the Maharashtra Land Revenue (Disposal of Government Land) Rules, 1971 framed under the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, 1966, encroachments on government land up to the date of January 1, 2015 for educational purpose can be regularized within the limits of permissible area under the case.
For this, the approval of the government is necessary. While regularising such encroachments, the full (100%) market value of the land as on the date of regularisation shall be recovered as the occupancy value of the land and 20% of the occupancy value as penalty. Also, the entire period of encroachment should be recovered from the holders of such encroachments by levying penalty as required under Section 50, sub-section (2) of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, 1966. Proposals for regularisation of encroachments on Government land up to the date of January 1, 2015 for educational purposes should be submitted to the Government immediately by the concerned Collector for taking a decision on the matter.
(7) The authorities competent to grant Government land in accordance with the prevailing policy of the Government shall be competent to proceed on a case to case basis in accordance with the decision of the Government. The District Collector of the concerned district shall be competent to take action in respect of section 01 (viii) and section 05.
However, if the use has started without the prior approval of the competent authority in the cases mentioned in (iii) to (vi) b of section 01 of the Government Decision or if there is a change in management in the case mentioned in (vii), then the Collector will be required to charge the freebies after taking prior approval of the Government.

GOVERNMENT DECISION NO. 2621/ PR. NO. 03/ J-3, dated 31st July, 2023 08. If the Government has provided Government land through Revenue Department to the Administrative Departments of the Government or the Authority/ Institution/ Corporation under their control, they shall not be able to provide such Government land directly to any person or institution mutually for educational or any other purpose. However, if it is necessary to provide the said government land for educational or other purposes, such land should first be handed over to the government by the concerned administrative department or authority/ institution/ corporation under their control. Thereafter, the appropriate decision regarding the grant of such land will be taken by the Government, taking into consideration the prevailing policy regarding the grant of land by the Government to the person or institution demanding the land.
Further, while providing government land for educational purposes, the provision should be included in the land grant order that if the condition is violated after the land is provided, and if it is not in accordance with the rules as per the prevailing policy, then such provided government land will be eligible for deposit by the government.
From now on, the land rent of government land to be granted on lease for more than 5 years for educational purposes should be revised every 5 years.
While making such amendments in the land rent, the land rent should be determined taking into account the market value of the land at that time and the discount rate in this policy. It should be ensured that such a condition is fixed in the land grant order.
11. The said Government Decision. State Cabinet Issued pursuant to the decision of the meeting dated 16/07/2023.
