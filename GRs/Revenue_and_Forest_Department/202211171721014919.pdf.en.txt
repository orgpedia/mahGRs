The lack of an internal audit seems to be the reason. Objections regarding cash are raised in the audit of a large amount of expenditure, but such objections are also raised in the audit of the deposit, and the objection is not removed from the Accountant General's office until the balance is reconciled by completing the cash.
The government vide reference No. The instructions have already been issued under Circulars 4 and 5. In view of the objections raised in the audit conducted by the Accountant General's Office and the errors found during the inspection by the Special Inspection Team, the general guidelines for writing the cash booklet in the form of Reference No. 6 was attached to the letter. In this regard, Reference Letter No. Supplementary instructions were also issued under Sections 7 and 8. But the investigation of the special inspection team has revealed that the instructions were not given by the controlling officers to their subordinate offices and as a result, the cash book is still not being written properly by the subordinate offices. Therefore, the matter of issuing instructions regarding cash in the form of this circular was under the consideration of the government.
It is the responsibility of the concerned employee/ Drawing and Disbursing Officer/ Head of Office to write and sign the circular cash on a daily basis. Financial irregularities/ misappropriation/ misappropriation are possible in such offices due to non-accountability of deposits/ expenditure due to non-fulfillment of cash, large amount of unaccounted money in bank/ cash and non-collateralization of such unaccounted money in government accounts etc. The cash register in the office should be up-to-date, well-written and complete, as cash registers are a mirror of the transactions of the office. Therefore, the general instructions for writing cash are prescribed as attached.
These instructions are only a guideline and all concerned should ensure that the basic provisions of the relevant government rules are complied with.
All the Controlling Authorities are hereby informed that they shall strictly observe the provisions of Bombay Financial Rules 1959, Maharashtra Treasury Rules 1968 and instructions issued by the Government from time to time in writing/ keeping the cash accounts of their offices and their subordinate offices.
Responsibility should be fixed on all the officers/ employees who are guilty in this regard and appropriate administrative action should be taken against them in time.
The Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Forest Force), Nagpur shall issue necessary instructions in this regard at his level to all the offices under him.
