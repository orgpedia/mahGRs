Read: - 1. Revised Sand Export Policy-2025, Government Decisions, Revenue & Forest Department, No. Gokhani - 10/0125 Q. No.05 / B-1, D 08.04.2025
2. Date 13.05.2025 Ma. Decision taken in the Cabinet meetings 3. The Maharashtra Bore Minerals Exploration (Development and Regulation) Rules, 2013
The Proposal: -
Sand plays an important role in the development of infrastructure in the modern economy. Sand is mainly found in the river basin. For ecological balance of rivers, sand from rivers needs to be used in a safe manner. Therefore, natural sand needs to be developed as an M-sand (artificial sand) alternative.
As the availability of sand in the state is low, the shortfall is being met from the sand coming from other states. However, the demand for sand in the state is likely to increase manifold given the targets set for development in the future. Government and Govt. The court's imposition of environmentally friendly standards has limited the availability of sand found in the river basin. Hence, there is a need for corrosive constructionable sand that can replace the sand that is coming out of the riverbed. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ - Can be completed by sand (artificial sand). Synthetic sand or M-sand is the most suitable alternative material for natural sand. Therefore, the government was considering formulating a policy to promote M-SAD. The government has taken the following decisions:
Government Decision: - To promote M-ASH as the most suitable alternative material to synthetic sand or M-Sand for natural sand, the following policy is being formulated: -
Manufactured Sand or M-Sand Definition: BSI and Indian Standards (IS)
The codes viz. IS 382:2016 - Coarse and fine aggregate for concrete-specification (Third Revision), IS & & W: 888 - Sand for plaster-specification (Second Revision), IS
2116:1980 - Specification for sand for masonry mortars (First Revision), IS 456:2000 - Plain and reinforced concrete code of practice (Fourth Revision) & such other standards
as fixed by BSI from time to time and should be suitable for construction activities. Fine
