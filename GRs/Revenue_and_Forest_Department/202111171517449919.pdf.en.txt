The Government of Maharashtra
the Revenue and Forest Department
(Disaster management, relief and rehabilitation)
Government Resolution No. AP-2020/ No.77/ AP-1
Ministry, Mumbai: 400032.
The September 29, 2021
The Proposal:
It is necessary to respond in a sophisticated manner so that it is possible to reduce the loss of lives/ finances if a disaster occurs by responding immediately to it. For this, the National Disaster Management Authority has instructed to equip the emergency work centers operating at the state and district level with all the resources. Accordingly, the IRS system is to be implemented in the state taking into account the disaster gradient of the state.
Since the IRS system has been implemented in some states of the country, instead of publishing Expression of Interest (EOI), it should be published directly as Request for Proposal (RFP). Wipro and Maha-IT, two state government companies, have prepared the RFP to implement the IRS system. The cost as per the BOQ submitted by Wipro as well as the administrative approval of the proposal was under consideration of the government.
Government's decision:
Considering the multi-disaster prone nature of the State and the importance of IRS system in disaster management, the State Government has decided to implement IRS system in the State for disaster management and Rs. Administrative Sanction is being accorded for an expenditure of Rs. 34,81,76, 000/- (Rupees Thirty Four Crores Eighty One Lakh Seventy Six Thousand only).
The scheme will be implemented in the state from 2021-22.
The company selected to implement the IRS system will be paid as follows:
60% of the funds will be disbursed after installation and commissioning of IRS system at State Emergency Operation Centre (SEOC) and District Emergency Operation Centre (DEOC).
â€¢ 10% of the funds will be disbursed once the necessary hardware for the IRS system is supplied.
30% of the funds will be disbursed after completion of training on IRS system at the state and district level.
