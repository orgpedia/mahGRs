Preamble: The Revenue and Forest Department, vide Government Notification dated 02.05.2014, has framed the Land Records Department Group-C Posts (Entry into Service) (Amendment) Rules, 2014. In Part-C of the Schedule, 25:75 ratio of promotion and nomination respectively has been prescribed for appointments to Group-C posts. Accordingly, in Pune Division, out of total 834 sanctioned posts in Group-C Post Group 4 (Bhukaramakar) cadre, 208 posts in promotion quota and 626 posts in direct service quota have been sanctioned. However, the number of pending enumeration cases in the State is 1,86,561 at the end of July, 2022, out of which the highest number of pending enumeration cases are in Pune division with 48,415 cases. It is planned to dispose of 60,974 pending cases at the state level by the end of December 2022. As there is an awareness among the people about the rights of the land and boundaries, a large number of applications are being received for land enumeration. At the same time, land needs to be acquired for various government projects. Also, enumeration of land is essential for allotment of forest pattas to the forest rights lease holder under the Forest Rights Act. Due to the extended family system and inheritance rights the cases of patrimony are increasing. Judgments are also being delivered in various court cases. With increasing urbanization, there is a need for adequate geometers for urban land measurement in urban areas. Thus, due to various reasons, the increasing number of counting cases and less available manpower, the counting cases are pending. As a result, the complaints of the people are increasing. Therefore, as there are not enough qualified staff available to fill the posts by promotion in Pune Division, 100 posts in the promotion quota are being filled.
