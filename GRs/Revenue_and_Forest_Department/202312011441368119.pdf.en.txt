Preamble- The Government receives proposals for regularization of waiting period of officers working in the field establishment under the Department of Revenue, Stamp Duty and Land Records in accordance with the provisions of the M.N.S. (General Conditions of Service) Rules, 1981, if they are awaiting appointment on administrative grounds. On perusal of the said proposals, it is observed that officers awaiting posting on administrative grounds join the Government or the concerned District Head/ Head of Department on the first day after demitting office from the earlier functional post. However, it has been observed that the services of the concerned officers are not available as they are not working in any establishment during the waiting period of appointment till the new posting order is issued. Therefore, the matter of providing services during the waiting period of the officers waiting for appointment was under the consideration of the government.
Government Circular- If the officers working on the field establishment under the Department of Revenue, Stamp Duty and Land Records are waiting for appointment for administrative reasons, the following instructions are being given regarding the availability of services and attendance of the officers waiting for appointment until the order of their new posting.
(a) The officers awaiting posting shall be required to report to the District Head/ Head of Department of the district in which they were working regularly or at the level of the Government before proceeding to the post till the regular posting is made. Also, after the officer on deputation is relieved from the post of deputation, he will be required to report to the district head/ department head of the district in which he was working regularly or at the government level before going on deputation. In this regard, it is mentioned that the officers awaiting appointment in various cadres in the Revenue, Stamp Duty and Land Records Department are required to join the government or the office of the concerned department/ district head as mentioned in the following table during the waiting period of appointment and register their daily attendance.
