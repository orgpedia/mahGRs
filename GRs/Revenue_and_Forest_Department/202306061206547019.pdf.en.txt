| The payment can be made online. Apart from this, the old rights records under the office of the Prohibition Commissioner can also be collected. |
| The scanning has been completed and the record of this right has been given to the citizens under the eRecord project.                          |
| The process of making the portal available is underway.                                                                                         |
| The revenue generated under the e-Chawadi project is about 3 crore 24 lakh land holders                                                         |
| They accept talathis from the account holders. These amounts range from very low value such as Rs 2, Rs 5.                                      |
| Lakhs of rupees can be like this. Normally a person gets money for land or cash in his garden.                                                  |

| Thus, the process of invoicing is complex. low denomination of amounts, large number of account holders and invoicing                           |
| The complexity of doing so allows the use of the grass system to pay revenue to landholders                                                     |

| Access will be easy.                                                                                                                            |

| Online revenue collection is an important objective.                                                                                            |

The Commissioner of Settlement and Director, Land Records, Maharashtra State, Pune shall lay down a definite policy/ procedure regarding the defacement of the currency deposited through this system so as to ensure that the currency does not get defaced after the service is provided to the concerned actor.
