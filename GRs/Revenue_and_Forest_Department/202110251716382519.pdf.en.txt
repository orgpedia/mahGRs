Order: Whether the stamp duty required by the Act for the documents related to the work of government departments, local bodies and banks in the state has been paid through the government's e-payment system GRAS? The responsibility of ensuring this has been entrusted to these government departments, local bodies and banks under Section 10D of the Maharashtra Stamp Act. A notification was issued on 3rd June, 2016 specifying the departments/ institutions for which this obligation will be applicable.
Also, under the government's Ease of Doing Business (EODB) policy, emphasis is being laid on the use of Section 10D system of the Maharashtra Stamp Act. Accordingly, the Department of Registration and Stamps is trying to incorporate more banks and financial institutions in the system for the implementation of Section 10E. At present, a total of 11 banks in the banking and non-banking sector, including nationalized banks, are operating under 10D. Also, many banks and financial institutions are willing to use this system in the future.
National e-Governance Services Ltd. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) needs to be signed with the organization.
National e-Governance Services Ltd. (NeSL) The objective of this organization is to establish a financial system, in which the data and documents of the loan given by the borrower will be available for the facilitation of the loan portfolio, the center for intra-external bundling and down-selling. NeSL has developed Digital Document Execution (DDE) platform under the regulation of IBBI. Working on the system of NeSL, both the e-sign and e-stamp procedures become easier and faster, so the process and transaction cost is less. Under Section 10D of the Maharashtra Stamp Act, all the banks are available on a single platform through NeSL while charging stamp duty.

The possibility is low. If a bank has missed or undercharged stamp duty, it will be helpful to find out as all banks are available on one platform. Through NeSL, many banking and non-banking financial institutions will be added to this. Banks will save time as NeSL itself will facilitate the loan data and documents provided by the borrower by charging minimal fees for the facilitation, inter-external, bundling and down-selling of the loan portfolio. Citizens will get online facilities for loan cases at home, which will save their time and money.
In view of all these aspects, the Government is required to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with NeSL to implement the stamp duty levy under Section 10E of the Maharashtra Stamp Act and to accommodate more banks and financial institutions in the system. National e-Governance Services Ltd. The order authorises the Inspector General of Registration and Controller of Stamps, Maharashtra State, Pune to sign the MoU with the company.
