Madam Cama Marg, Hutatma Rajguru Chowk,
Ministry, Mumbai- 400 032.
Date: 25th of April 2023
Part III of the National Action Plan Code, 2014 (No.32 of 2014) was issued by the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Head of Forest Force), Maharashtra State, Nagpur. Letter dated 15/11/2022.
Preamble: To ensure sustainable management of forests, a work plan is prepared and approved by the Central Government as per the guidelines of the National Working Plan Code-2014 for the Sustainable Management of Forests and Biodiversity in India. In the year 1996. The Supreme Court, in its judgment in the case of Godavarman Tirumalapad vs Union of India, has directed that the forests of the country will be managed as per the approved work plan. In view of the importance of work planning, the National Work Planning Code, 2014, vide Para No. 29 states that" A Working Plan Unit (WPU) at the field level should be headed by Working Plan Officer (WPO) of the rank of Conservator of Forests." Some states have already implemented such a policy. With regard to the postings, the State has decided the policy of posting of officers of the rank of Conservator of Forests in accordance with this provision.
During the last few years, it has been observed that officers who do not have enough experience in field work or who have less experience have been posted in the State Planning Department. This has been shown to have an adverse effect on the quality of work planning and the delay in writing the work plan.
In view of the above background, it was under the consideration of the Government to frame a policy for posting of Indian Forest Service officers in all the posts in the Planning Department in the State.
Government Decision: 1) An officer of the rank of Chief Conservator of Forests should be posted in the Planning Department.

In case of non-availability of Forest Guard rank officer, the post of Deputy Forest Guard rank officer with minimum 10 years of service and at least one full term (3 years) in a Regional Forest Division should be posted.
(3) Even if an officer of the rank of Deputy Conservator of Forests and Conservator of Forests is transferred or promoted after his posting in the department, the responsibility of writing the work plan of the department whose work plan is being handled by the concerned officer shall remain with the same officer.
