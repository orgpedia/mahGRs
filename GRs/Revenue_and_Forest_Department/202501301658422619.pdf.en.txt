In view of these factors, the Government is incorporating the draft of the proposed Sand / Sand Export Policy-2025 as Statement-A for objections / suggestions by modifying and modifying the comprehensive policy on sand mining, storage and sale through online system, dated 16.02.2024 and policy on field sand release, dated 15.03.2024.
