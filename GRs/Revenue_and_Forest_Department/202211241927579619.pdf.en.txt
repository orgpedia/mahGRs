As per the definition of 09.08.1995, the beneficiaries of the original earthquake victims who are eligible as per the Government decision of 2015 are facing difficulties in getting the benefit. Hence, there is a need to amend the definition. Also, if the original earthquake victim has died or is not eligible for a government job according to age, there is a problem in issuing the certificate as there is no policy to transfer the certificate to his eligible family. Considering these difficulties, the government was considering to revise the definition of earthquake victims and decide on a policy on transfer.
