The above proposal No. 1 is mentioned here. As per the Government decision dated 31.08.2009, the In the wake of the terrorist attack carried out by terrorists on 26.11.2008, 26 Rapid Response Teams have been formed in the Mumbai City Police Force at the establishment of the Office of the Commissioner of Police, Brihanmumbai, on the lines of the National Security Guard, to counter such terrorist attacks. A total of 1378 posts in the cadre of officers/ staff have been sanctioned for these 26 Rapid Response Teams. Presently, 15 Rapid Response Teams are operational with a total manpower of 852 officers/ staff. Since the establishment of the officers/ staff of the Rapid Response Team is being done through various zonal offices under the Commissioner of Police, Brihanmumbai, there is a delay due to administrative difficulties in taking the records of the service matters of these personnel. As a result, the day-to-day work of the staff is adversely affected. Keeping in view the future growing capabilities of the Rapid Response Team, it is imperative that the establishment of the Rapid Response Team is separate and in one office.
In reference to above No. 2 is mentioned here. Quick Response by Commissioner of Police, Brihanmumbai under Deputy Commissioner of Police, Rapid Response Team vide letter dated 13.05.2019
