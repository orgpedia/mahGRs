Nagpur is the capital of Maharashtra. Since the India Reserve Battalion is under the command of the Central Government, it would be appropriate to have the battalion at Katol, G.Nagpur, instead of Akola, to facilitate its immediate deployment to other States, if the need arises elsewhere in the country. Nagpur city is a central place for rail, air and road transport.

Indian Reserve Battalion No. The manpower sanctioned for the 5 will be available for recruitment from the nearby Naxalite areas of Gadchiroli, Chandrapur, Gondia and Aheri, for which the location of Katol G. Nagpur in Vidarbha is convenient instead of Akola district. If the battalion is located in Akola district, the question of inter-district/ group transfer of the candidates recruited from the above-mentioned Naxal areas is likely to arise in the future and it may be difficult from the administrative point of view.
