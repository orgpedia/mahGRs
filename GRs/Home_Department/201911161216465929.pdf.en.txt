Reference:- 1. MVR- 0909/2429/ CR 367/ Para-2, dated 10.02.2010.
(2) Government Decision No. MVR- 0909/2429/ CR 367/ Para-2, dated 19.11.2009.
Government's decision:
It has come to the notice of the Government that the transporters in the State are facing difficulties in obtaining permission from the Police, Public Works Department, National Highways Authority of India, Regional/ Sub-Regional Transport Officers and Transport Commissioner's Office to transport ODC goods on trailers or other vehicles with a length of more than 18 meters. Some transporters follow the above mechanisms for permitting the movement of ODC goods. However, they are not allowed. So, they face some problems. The central government has created a system to allow online movement of Odissi vehicles on national highways. After considering all these aspects, in order to bring uniformity and transparency in the licensing system set up by the Central Government, it has been decided to formulate the following procedures by formalizing the previous directives of the Government.
Methods of operation:
(1) The goods transporters who are required to transport Odyssey goods from one place to another or from outside the State in trailers or other vehicles of more than 18 meters in length may approach the Regional/ Sub-Regional Transport Office or Transport Commissioner's Office concerned in the area of the Regional/ Sub-Regional Transport Office from where the goods are to be transported through on-line mode with the fee prescribed for transportation of Odyssey goods.

Submit the application. Attach a photo of the vehicle. For this, the inspection of the motor vehicle inspector should not be insisted.
Provision should be made immediately that no-objection certificate will be issued through on-line mode within 24 hours from the receipt of request for no-objection certificate from Regional/ Sub-Regional Transport Office.
3) If it is found that the goods are transported in excess of the quantity mentioned in the application, penal action should be taken considering the cancellation of the permission given.
4) When the goods carriers are bringing Odia goods from outside the state, they should also follow the above procedure.
The Additional Director General of Police (Traffic) and the Transport Commissioner shall instruct all the concerned officers under them to take necessary measures/ precautions so that no vehicle of more than 18 meters in length can transport ODC goods without prior permission of the government and the concerned agencies.
If a vehicle is found transporting ODC goods without permission, strict penal action should be taken against it.
The Transport Commissioner's office should develop an online system for ODC permits. After the development of the online system, four times the compromise fee/ DA will be charged from the vehicles transporting ODC without permission.
6) The Public Works Department should provide information about the map of the roads in the state, the design of the roads, the load carrying capacity of the roads, the bridges on the road, etc. on the website within 15 days. Using this information, freight forwarders should plan their freight movement in advance.
(7) Overnight movement of goods should be allowed for Odissi goods traffic, except at ghats.
8) It will be the responsibility of the vehicle owner to plan the journey with the traffic police so that there is no obstruction to the traffic during the Odyssey transport.
(9) Carrying of goods in excess of the carrying capacity shall not be permitted under any circumstances.
