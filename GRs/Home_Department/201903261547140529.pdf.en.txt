Metro rail work is going on in many cities of the state. This has resulted in narrowing of the road and obstructing vehicular movement. Therefore, in order to ensure smooth flow of traffic on such roads, the traffic police and the authority/ company constructing the metro project should take all necessary preventive measures at the site so that there is no unauthorized parking and no scrap/ waste vehicles are left at the site. Care should be taken to ensure that these measures are implemented consistently and effectively.
The grievance redressal mechanism created for citizens to complain about debris/ unattended vehicles, unauthorised parking, etc. on roads obstructing traffic should be publicized on a large scale and through various media on a regular basis, so that more and more citizens can easily lodge complaints and awareness can also be created among the public about unauthorised parking.
The office of the Director General of Police should take immediate action on the above suggestions and submit a report to the government. Also, the head of the police unit should immediately bring these instructions to the notice of the traffic branch under his command and pay special attention to ensure their effective and effective implementation.
