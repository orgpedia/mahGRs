Force One is a special forces unit. The Force One team is tasked with the responsibility of dealing with terrorist attacks, hijacking and hostage rescue. The aspiring officers and staff have to undergo a gruelling 22-week training before they can join the team. Accordingly, the Police Officers/ Personnel of Force One Squad were sanctioned 100% incentive of basic pay for 325 posts in the Working Group in the 6th Pay Commission, 25% incentive of basic pay for 99 posts in the Technical and Supplementary Department and 50% incentive of basic pay for 44 posts in the Civil Anti-Terrorist Training Center.
Now, after the implementation of the 7th Pay Commission in the State, a proposal was under consideration of the Government for sanctioning incentive (risk) allowance in proportion to the basic pay of the 7th Pay Commission, as was admissible to the police officers/ personnel in the Force One squad. The government has taken the following decisions:
