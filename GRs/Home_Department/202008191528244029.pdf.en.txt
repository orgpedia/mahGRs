Preamble: The Rapid Response Team Officers/ Commanders have to deal with the terrorist attacks on Mumbai city in the first place, dealing with terrorist attacks, handling hijack situations and hostage rescue. After the terrorist attack on the city of Mumbai on 26/11/2008, in order to deal with such terrorist attack, on the recommendation of Ram Pradhan Committee, the aforesaid Reference No. Rapid response teams were formed as per the government decisions at 1, 2 and 4. The Government has decided to pay 50% of the total gross salary plus dearness allowance as additional pay incentive to the officers/ officials of the said team at their parent establishment. However, since the team was constituted in 2009 and the 6th Pay Commission was implemented in the State in 2008, the provisions of the said Government Decision have been implemented in the 6th Pay Commission and accordingly, the officers/ staff of the Rapid Response Team are being given incentive allowance.
Since the task of the team is very risky, the officers/ officials of the police force are in line to be given incentives for their willingness to join the Rapid Response Team.
In the 6th Pay Commission, the incentive was given on the basis of Basic+ Grade Pay. However, the concept of Grade Pay has been abolished in the 7th Pay Commission. Therefore, the matter of sanctioning incentive allowance to the police officers/ officials in the Rapid Response Team as per the recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission was under the consideration of the Government. A decision in this regard is being taken.
Government Decision: Approval is being given to sanction incentive@ 25% of the basic pay of the 7th Pay Commission to the officers/ officials of Rapid Response Team. The details of the officers/ officials of the Rapid Response Team are mentioned in the accompanying statement. (Letters A and B)
