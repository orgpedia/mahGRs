Government Resolution No: NAX 0720/ P.S. No.110/ VISA 1B
The officers/ staff of various wings of the Force should be paid salary and dearness allowance at the rate of one and half times of the permissible salary for the period of service, taking into account the hazardous work they have to do while working/ deployed in sensitive areas.
The benefit of one-time promotion is admissible to the officers/ employees of the State Intelligence Department wherever they are working in the State. However, the nature of work of the officers/ staff working in Gondia and Gadchiroli districts is very risky. Therefore, the officers/ staff of the State Intelligence Department working in the sensitive areas of the district should be given the benefit of one-time promotion or one-and-a-half times of the permissible salary and dearness allowance, whichever is higher, at the rate of one-and-a-half times of the permissible salary as in the case of officers/ staff working in the sensitive police stations/ police sub-stations/ armed remote areas.
The State Reserve Police Force (SRPF) units are deployed in the high-sensitive areas of Gadchiroli, Aheri and Gondia districts. Therefore, those who are working in sensitive sectors should also be given basic pay plus dearness allowance at the rate of one and a half times the permissible salary. Officers and staff of the State Reserve Police Force will be entitled to dearness allowance at the rate of one and a half times the permissible salary, if they are working in the said sensitive areas.
The concerned officers/ employees working in the Naxal affected areas will not be eligible for any other financial concessions as applicable to the officers/ employees working in the Naxal affected areas by the General Administration Department. The officials concerned should look into the matter and pay the salaries accordingly.
5.The additional expenditure on salary and dearness allowance arising in this regard shall be covered under the head of accounts under which the salary and allowances of these employees are spent and shall be covered by the approved provision.
6. the order. This will be applicable for the period from April 1, 2022 to March 31, 2023.
These orders are being issued pursuant to the concurrence given by the Department of Finance vide informal reference No. 423/2022/ Expenditure-7 dated 27/9/2022.
