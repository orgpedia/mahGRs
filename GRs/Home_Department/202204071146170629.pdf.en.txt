Introduction: In Palghar district, Naigaon is a village situated on the banks of a creek. A passenger jetty exists at Naigaon and is used by locals to travel to and from Panju Island. The population of Panju Island is about three thousand, and this was the only way for its inhabitants to get to the city. So far, passenger traffic is running between Naigaon and Panju.
