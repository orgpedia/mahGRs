The Proposal:
The State is under" Lockdown" since 23.03.2020 to contain the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. In such a situation, if the permissible rent exemption or extension in the case of police service accommodation has expired or is about to expire, the applicant police officers/ employees or their family members, as the case may be, have been granted extension by the relevant government decisions to occupy the police service accommodation under the Director General of Police, Maharashtra and Commissioner of Police, Brihanmumbai on the condition of payment of licence fee till the situation becomes normal.
Now, the situation is almost back to normal. Therefore, the matter of taking a decision regarding the extension given to take over the police service residence was under the consideration of the government.
Government's decision:
The extension granted to the applicant police officers/ staff or their family members, as the case may be, to occupy the Police Service Residence under the Director General of Police, Maharashtra and Commissioner of Police, Brihanmumbai, will expire on 31.03.2021.
