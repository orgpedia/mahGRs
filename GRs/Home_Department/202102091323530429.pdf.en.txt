Topic: Ganesh Chaturthi 2021
This year's event was held in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. On February 15th,
It was decided to celebrate Maghi Ganeshotsav in a simple manner starting from 2021
Following are the guidelines: For public Maghi Ganeshotsav, the boards will be required to take due prior permission from the Municipal Corporation/ Local Administration as per their policy.
2. m. Mandaps of limited size should be erected in accordance with the orders issued by the court and the policy of the Municipal Corporation and the concerned local administration regarding the mandaps.
3. Due to the contagious situation arising out of COVID-19, it was decided last year that" if it is possible to postpone the immersion of Ganesh idols, it is possible to do Ganpati immersion at the time of Maghi Ganeshotsav immersion or at the time of immersion in the month of Bhadrapada of 2021." However, due to the Corona epidemic, Maghi Ganpati arrival and immersion processions should not be taken out.
The height of the idol in Maghi Ganeshotsav should be within 4 feet for public congregations and 2 feet for domestic Ganpati idols.
This year, instead of the traditional Ganesha idol, metal/ marble etc. should be worshipped at home. If the idol is eco-friendly, it should be immersed at home.
If immersion is not possible at home, coordination should be made with the local administration regarding immersion at the public immersion site.
6. Health activities/ camps instead of cultural programmes during Maghi Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav (e.g. Organizing blood donation) should be given priority and through this awareness should be created about Corona, Malaria, Dengue, etc. diseases and their preventive measures as well as cleanliness.
7.Maximum arrangements should be made to provide the facility of darshan of Shri Ganesh online, through cable network, website and Facebook etc.
8. Adequate arrangements for disinfection and thermal screening should be made in Ganpati mandaps.
Special attention should be paid to the physical distance and the observance of hygiene rules (masks, sanitizers, etc.) for the devotees who want to come and visit physically.
