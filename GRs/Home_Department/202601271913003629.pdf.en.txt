Read - Government Decision, Home Department, No: Saturday-1025 / Q. No.678 / Pol-7 (E-1373599), dated 10th October, 2025
The Proposal: -
The number of Mumbai Police forces has been increased in a phased manner as the population of Mumbai city increases and the situation changes. At present, 94 police stations, 5 SASTRA police forces and other special branches have been created and 59,308 manpower is currently working in the Mumbai Police force.
The lack of accommodation for the Mumbai Police force is being felt more and more strongly due to the city's population and increasing responsibilities. At present, many officers and bureaucrats have to live far away due to the scarce number of police residences available at 919762. The Mumbai Police officers and Amaldars have to live in far-flung places like Virar, Palghar, Kalyan, Karjat, Kasara, Panvel, which delays them from performing important day-to-day tasks and attending to duties in the police force. About 50 per cent of the police manpower is on duty covering a distance of about 80 to 100 km. This affects the efficiency and morale of the police force.
Therefore, in view of the growing population and security responsibilities in Mumbai, the police force is required to set up well-equipped colonies for police officers / amldars by redeveloping police colonies by increasing the number of residences. This will enable the police force to carry out the task of maintaining law and order by responding more efficiently and quickly. For this, the Police Housing Township Project for Policing in Mumbai needs to be materialized. For Mumbai Police in the city of Mumbai, taking into consideration all aspects of the project, it is necessary to prepare a planned plan for accelerating the project.
