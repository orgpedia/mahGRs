5) Commissioner, State Excise, Mumbai Proposal No. Device 1023 / DualFeed Policy /
258 / four, d. 09.06.2025.
The Proposal: -
The policy on production of waterless liquor (ethanol) is based on Government Decision No. BPA 1102 / CR-10 /
EXC-3, D. Declared under 10.07.2003. Thereafter, the government decided to
No. MPL-0617 / P.No.181 / Raushu-3, D. This is somewhat improved under 03.11.2017.
This policy has been broadened. The ethanol blending policy of the central government in the present case
According to the Ethanol Blending Programme, increasing the amount of ethanol blending in payrolls, auto fuels
Accordingly, sugar / sugar syrup / sugarcane juice / B-heavy to promote ethanol production.
The Government has from time to time announced a policy regarding the production of ethanol from millets / C-heavy millets.
Now the Central Government has given sugar / sugar syrup / sugarcane juice / B-heavy to milling based distillers.
To promote ethanol production from C-Heavy Millets as well as ethanol production from cereals.
Read above No. The policy has been announced under Section 4. Accordingly, the No. 5 The Commissioner,
Sugar / Sugar syrup / Sugarcane juice / B-heavy found as per proposal of State Excise
/ C-Heavy Millet to ethanol-producing mill-based distillers, including
Policy on Dual-Fed Production of Waterless Alcohol (Ethanol) from Paddy
The decision was under the consideration of the government.

The Government's Decisions:
Sugar / sugar syrup to millet-based "Sample-I" licensed distillers /
Dual-feed from grains including sugarcane juice / B-heavy millet / C-heavy millet
A policy on producing waterless alcohol (ethanol) is being approved.
2. Such distillates are treated with waterless alcohol from the grain in a dual-fed manner.
To produce (ethanol), prior approval of the government will be required and a proposal to this effect will be submitted.
In doing so, the following documents will need to be completed, as required: -
1) Revised Environmental Clearance (EC) certificate from the Union Ministry of Environment.
2) Revised Consent to Operate certificate from Maharashtra Pollution Control Board.
3) Approval / License of PESO Department as per the change of map in the design.
4) Installed capacity of working mill-based distillation, available tanks, etc., with approved map.
Details.
5) Details along with the proposed map, if any, of the required capacity addition / modification.
3. Distillation to implement Dual-Feeq strategy:
It would be nice to have technical aspects: -
1) Cereals in distillation to implement dual-feed strategy.
There should be proper arrangements for storage. for the preparation of feed from grains and
Fermentation for the grain should be well arranged.
2) Raw materials used in distillation for ethanol production in double gla method
Separate receiver tanks and separate storage tanks should be arranged depending on the cargo and
The quotation should be recorded in that proportion.
3) Remaining grain powder (Distillers Dry Grain Soluble) after alcohol is obtained from the grain
Maharashtra Pollution is the preferred system for processing and proper disposal.
It should be established as per the norms of the Board of Control.
4. When Uhl MAIR ceases to produce ethanol under the dual-source method (Qual-Feed)
Adoption of the following procedures in distillation before the second SIAR ethanol is produced:
MAA will be: -
1) Production of ethanol from one source ceases after production of ethanol from another source.
# Page 3
Read the reference in distillation before taking No. 4 here. By command of 21.12.2023
It will be mandatory to follow the given procedure.
2) The ethanol component will operate with one feedstock in one process line at a time. As well,
Variation of the product from one source to another in the dual-feed method to the corresponding components.
The Superintendent and In-charge concerned shall give written notice of the same 15 days in advance, if any.
Supervisory officers will be required to pay the state excise duty.
If more than one ethanol processing line is available in the same ethanol component, such
The feedstock for the processing lines will need to be used according to the following conditions.
1) Separate storage cH / facility for each type of feedstock and it is clearly
Marking will be optional.
2) Different process lines should be run on different feedstock. But
Only one type of feedstock at a time in any process line of ethanol component
will be used, and the connection to feed other HA goods in a line will be closed
It will have to be done.
3) Feedstock, fermentation, distillation, and de-hydration in each process line
There should be a separate mechanism for weighing the units. Prepare from each process line.
The ethanol receivers will be different for the ethanol that will occur and the other ethanol.
They will have no connection to the receivers.
4) Storage for ethanol is based on the use of CIRM feedstock and clearly
will need to be marked. Department Approves Use of Storage Tacks
Will be liked.
5) Permission to switch from one feedstock to another specific feedstock
The above can be done only after keeping it in operation for at least 30 days. In addition, the feedstock
The Superintendent and Officer-in-Charge concerned, State Excise, to replace at least 15
It will be necessary to give advance notice of the days.
6. The following terms / conditions are mandatory for production under the Dual-Al (Dual-Feed) policy:
It will remain: -
1) Millet-based distillation components with grain to double-blas (dual-feed)
Waterless alcohol (ethanol) can be produced. However, the alcohol produced from the grain
# Page 4
Can only be used for waterless liquor and its beverage can be used for alcohol
No.
2) Complying with the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board's rule and harming the environment.
The distiller concerned will be responsible for not doing so.
3) Read above No. The instructions set out in section 1 will apply to this policy as well.
4) As may be prescribed by the Central Government and the State Government from time to time in future in accordance with the present policy.
The terms and conditions to be made shall be binding on all entities.
7. The Commissioner of State Production to issue necessary supplementary instructions for the implementation of the said policy.
The fee should be issued by the state of Maharashtra, Mumbai from their level.
