5) Letter No.E-7/ B.No./ Restructuring/ Manpower Information/ 3743/2021 of Additional Director General of Police and Director, Communications/ Transport, Maharashtra State, Pune. 25.08.2021.
Preamble: Under the Department of Police, there are a total of 3930 sanctioned posts of officers/ staff in different 30 cadres from Additional Director General of Police to Police Constable (Workshop Assistant). A total of 32 posts are sanctioned in the cadre of Driver (Police Constable/ Police Naik/ Police Constable). As per the classification of the posts, the posts are mainly divided into two sub-sectors, namely, Engineering and Transport. There are a total of 30 separate designations of non-resident officers and employees under these two sub-divisions. With regard to the officers and employees working in the posts under various such cadres, it was necessary to simplify and simplify the process of their direct service recruitment, joining of services, promotions, transfers, their records, etc. in line with all administrative matters. So that there is no delay in the implementation of these things in the future. As a result, in order to have more coherence in the work of the non-tribal department, it was necessary to consider the reorganization of the non-tribal department and make a new revised structure.
Officers and staff in the executive police force are recruited in the same cadre. But as far as the work is concerned, the said officers and staff perform their duties in different branches of the executive police force as per the functions there. Similarly, a proposal was under the consideration of the government to reorganize the Police Department under the Office of the Director General of Police (with a revised diagram) and to rename the Police Department as" Police Communication, Information Technology and Transport Department, Maharashtra State," without classifying it as Engineering and Transport.
