As per the recommendations of the Kharge Committee, the Government has taken the following decisions with regard to the proceedings under the said notification and other matters incidental thereto.
Government Decision: 1) Restrictions on the purchase, collection and transportation of Mohafools within the state are being lifted. The provisions of Reference 1 regarding sample MF-3 license for deposit of mohafula, sample MF-4 license for purchase of mohafula and sample MF-5 license for transportation of mohafula are being repealed.

3) The policy of foreign export of Mohafool will remain open. However, an export permit is required. The license for the prototype MF-7 remains the same.
4) The Government has imposed restrictions under Reference 2 on fresh grant of MF-2 license for storage, sale and trade of mohafula. Restrictions on private individuals remain in place. However, the annual quota of Sample MF-2 licences granted in favour of private individuals is being limited. The maximum limit of the quota of these permits is being kept at 500 quintals per annum. The policy decision is being taken to reduce the quota of those licences whose quota is currently more than 500 quintals per annum to this extent and not to increase the quota of those whose quota is less than 500 quintals per annum.
5) In view of the Kharge Committee report, the Tribal Development Department will be required to approve a sample FF-2 license for the trade of Mohafuli if it develops a new scheme for the use of Mohafuli. Such MF-2 license should be granted only to the recognized bodies as per Rule 2 (c) of the Bombay Mohafule Rules, 1950, such as Tribal Development Societies, Women Self Help Groups, Cooperative Societies and Gram Panchayats in tribal areas and tribal members.
6) Bonds should be obtained from the concerned agencies so that the mohafuls are not misused while granting such licences. So that if any misuse is found by their organization, then the competent authority of the organization concerned will be eligible for criminal action along with penal action, cancellation of license, as the case may be.
7) With the removal of restrictions and licenses for the possession, collection and transportation of Mohafuls within the state, the following orders/ rules passed in accordance with the Bombay Mohafool Rules, 1950, will lapse and necessary notification in this regard will be issued separately.
