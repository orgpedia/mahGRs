Introduction: People of all religions, castes and tribes live in the state and there should be brotherhood and friendship among them. Necessary care has to be taken to avoid tension, discord during religious festivals, festivals and processions etc. Despite taking necessary precautions, unfortunately, if some untoward incident takes place, it is necessary to make continuous efforts to ensure that the cases do not get aggravated with the cooperation of prominent persons of all castes and religions. The public also participates in the work of the police
To reduce the crime rate, to create trust in the minds of the people and to create harmony between the people and the police, local police have to take initiatives like Mohalla Ekta Committee, Peace Committee, Mohalla Panchayat, Tanta Mukt Samiti, Police Mitra and other small local level initiatives to maintain peace in advance.
2. Some of the best initiatives of the above initiatives are not functioning effectively due to lack of adequate funds. Therefore, it was necessary to implement the concept of Public and Police Policing in the state by introducing a new sub-heading and creating a separate statistic under the main head 2055. According to the separate computer statistics, the policy implementation of the activities carried out by various departments of the Home Department will continue through the same department and there will be no change in it. Government spending on these activities is also prevalent.
There will be no additional financial burden on the government.
Only the expenditure on the above activities needs to be rationalized and synchronized to make it look cohesive.
