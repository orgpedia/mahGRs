Government circular
Reference- Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India, New Delhi Circular No. 25022/18/5-FI, dated 5/4/2005.
If foreign artists participate in the program organized in the state, then a no-objection certificate is issued by the Home Department as per the instructions of the Government of India.
There is no guideline issued by the Central or State Government as to how many days before the scheduled date of the event, the proposal should be submitted by the concerned organizers to the Government for giving No Objection Certificate to such events, and how many days the foreign registrar should submit the report to the Government. Obviously, there is not enough time to complete the process of seeking a report from the concerned Foreigners Registration Officer on receipt of the proposal on time and on receipt of such a report, scrutinizing the report and approving it to the government and providing a no-objection certificate to the concerned organizing agency before the scheduled date and time of the event, giving a copy of the certificate to the concerned local police station. The government has taken the following steps to address the issue:
For events involving foreign artists being organised in the state, the concerned organizing agency must submit an application in a prescribed form to the government along with all the necessary documents at least 8 working days in advance.
After the Home Department has asked the concerned Foreigners Registration Officer for a report on the participation of foreign artists in the program, he should submit a report to the government at least two office days before the date of the program.
