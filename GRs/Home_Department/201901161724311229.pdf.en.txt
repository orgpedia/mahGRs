Government's decision:
The recommendations and terms and conditions submitted by the Committee headed by the Commissioner, State Excise, regarding the production of ethanol from sugarcane juice, B-heavy or C-heavy mill from the distilleries attached to the distilleries and sugar mills in the State are being approved.
The provisions regarding the TRS (Total Reducing Sugar) content in the mill and the alcohol extract produced from B-Hy, C-Hy mill and sugarcane juice according to the grade of mill in the distilleries attached to the distilleries and sugar mills in the state shall be as follows: a) Government Notification No. BPA 1091/ Q.No.5/ Raushu-2, Dt. As on 8.9.2015, the grade of liquor has been determined as follows:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Grade of            | Molasses          | T.R.S.% (Total  |  Reducing Sugar)  | Recovery of Spirit Litre per M.T. of C-Heavy molasses minimum |
| A.L.(Alcohol Litre) | B.L.(Bulk Litre)  |                 | P.L.(Proof Litre) |
| A                   | 50 and above.     | 233             | 245               | 407                                                           |
| B                   | 44 to 49.9        | 194             | 203               | 338                                                           |
| 40 to 43.9          | 150               | 156             | 262               |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) The different grades of millets mentioned above shall be called C-heavy millets. This is obtained from the three boiling system instead of the boiling of the B-masket. The mill obtained from the three boiling system and whatever the amount of TRS in it, that mill should be considered as C-heavy mill. The grade of C-heavy liquor will continue to be A, B, C as before and there is no need to change the criteria for alcohol consumption.
e) The mill which comes from the boiling of B. Masket in the sugar production process or is obtained by two boiling system and in which the TRS ratio is at least 55%, that mill should be called B-heavy mill. If the ratio of TRS in the mill obtained from two boiling system is less than 55%, then that mill should be considered as C-heavy mill.
(e) The notification issued by the Government in pursuance of the recommendations made by the Committee headed by the then Commissioner, Raushu, for determining the alcohol quotient from the mill on the basis of TRS in the mill. Alcohol Utilization Criteria as on 8.9.2015 should be relied upon.

While determining the alcohol content of B-heavy flour, based on the amount of TRS (Total Reducing Sugar) in B-heavy flour, two types should be done as follows.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Grade of B-Heavy Molasses | T.R.S.% (Total Reducing Sugar) | Recovery of Spirit Litre per M.T. of B-Heavy molasses minimum |
| A.L. (Alcohol Litre)      | B.L. (Bulk Litre)              | P.L. (Proof Litre)                                            |
| The BH-1                  | 60 and above.                  | 294                                                           | 308 | 514 |
| The BH-2                  | 55 to 59.99                    | 267                                                           | 280 | 467 |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
f) In order to determine the minimum extract of alcohol directly from sugarcane juice, the minimum extract of sugar is assumed to be 9.5%, while considering the fermentation and distillation efficiency, the minimum extract of alcohol from sugarcane juice is determined as follows.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Raw Material         | Recovery of Spirit Litre per M.T. of Sugarcane minimum |
| A.L. (Alcohol Litre) | B.L. (Bulk Litre)                                      | P.L. (Proof Litre) |
| Sugarcane Juice      | 57                                                     | 60                 | 100 |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As mentioned above, the minimum extract of alcohol from sugarcane juice is being determined. However, if the minimum production of liquor is not achieved due to some unavoidable reasons or other reasons, in such a case, the distiller will be required to submit a written explanation to the concerned District Superintendent up to 1% if the liquor production/ offtake is less than the minimum prescribed quantity, to the Commissioner, State Excise, Maharashtra State, Mumbai from 1 to 2% and to the Government with a strong reason if the offtake is less than 2%. The competent authority will take the appropriate decision in this regard.
The terms and conditions for the production and sale of ethanol from B-heavy, C-heavy mill and sugarcane juice by sugar mills/ distilleries in the State and for its storage and sale in distilling tanks shall be as follows: a) If the sugar mills are going to produce B-heavy mill, the time-bound schedule in this regard shall be intimated in writing at least ten days in advance to the officer in charge of the State Excise Department or the Superintendent, State Excise Office and the Sugar Commissioner's Office.
b) If the sugar factory is going to produce ethanol directly from sugarcane juice, then instructions should be given in writing in the same way as above.

ethanol from B-heavy mills will be permitted only to distilleries holding license under the Maharashtra Prohibition of Alcohol Act, 1949 and rules made thereunder.
The certificate regarding ethanol production from B-heavy mill will be issued by the officer in charge/ superintendent of distillery concerned, state excise.
q) It will be mandatory for the sugar factories to take sugar production if there is a shortage of sugar in the state.
(r) All statements relating to the production and storage of ethanol produced from B-heavy mills shall be kept independent of the records of other products produced in the premises.
s) The transportation of B heavy mill to distilleries attached to sugar mills will be done through pipeline. For this, a similar way-maint system will be installed at the sugar factory and the adjacent distillery. The officer in charge of the distillery will sign the prescribed transport pass while transporting the mill from the sugar mills to the distillery.
t) It shall be the sole responsibility of the sugar mill and the distillery management to ensure that the B-heavy molasses transported through the pipeline is not contaminated in any way.
5) Stand-alone distilleries who want to produce ethanol from B-heavy mills in the state will be allowed to produce ethanol from other by-products, except milling, on the condition that they do not produce ethanol from other by-products.
(v) C-heavy alloy is generally used for the production of liquor used for domestic/ foreign liquor production. In future, if the availability of C-heavy mill decreases, it will be met from B-heavy mill.
(w) If the distiller attached to a sugar factory wishes to produce ethanol from B-heavy only, such distiller may, by submitting a bond to the Commissioner, State Excise, use all tanks and receivers at the distillery establishment therein for storage of B-heavy mill and ethanol produced therefrom.
x) B-heavy and C-heavy mills will be transported from sugar mills through separate pumps.
A pump is provided for each pump. The valve of the pump for C-heavy mill will remain closed during the transportation of B-heavy mill. Similarly, the valve of the pump for B-heavy mill will remain closed during the transportation of C-heavy mill. Similar valves will also be installed on the distillation. In case the valves installed as above are not functional, the Regional Inspector and the officer in charge of the distillery will seal the valves. Only one vehicle can be used at a time.
In future, if any direction is received from the Government of India regarding installation of BIS certified Density Flow Meters for proper measurement of transport of B-Heavy and C-Heavy mills for sugar mills and distilleries, it will be mandatory for the respective mills and distilleries to comply with such directions.
