Government Orders have been issued to deposit Rs.20,000/- per annum from the salary payable to them in the month of July every year. The expenditure has also been directed to be spent under the head' 2055 Police- 001- Director (00) (01) Administration and Police Inspectorate 01 Salary." However, the said account is not available with the office of the Commissioner of Police, Brihanmumbai and any of the subordinate offices.
Therefore, the payment of uniform allowance is not being made in the unit office where the BHOPO officers are working. Due to this, the officials are facing technical difficulties in sanctioning the uniform allowance grant on time. Considering the facts presented by the office of the Director General of Police, the Home Department issued a series of government decisions regarding the sanction of uniform allowance at a revised rate to the officers of the Indian Police Service in the Maharashtra cadre. Issue of Corrigendum to amend Para 6 dated 22/02/2018 was under consideration of the Government.
