Office of the Joint Commissioner of Police (Administration), Commissioner of Police, Brihanmumbai, Mumbai vide letter dated 04.05.2020.
To effectively curb the activities of organized criminals in Brihanmumbai, the government had decided to form a special operation squad in the Crime Branch of the Criminal Investigation Department of the Brihanmumbai Police and provide it with modern weapons and other materials. According to reference no. 1 As per the decision of the Government of Maharashtra, a Special Task Force has been constituted in the Crime Branch of the Criminal Investigation Department under the establishment of the Commissioner of Police, Brihanmumbai. Also Reference No. Reference No. 1. 2 and Reference No. A total of 53 posts of 20 police officers and 33 police officials have been sanctioned for the special task force. Also Reference No. 4 As per the decision of the Government, it was decided to provide 50% additional pay of all other salaries and allowances excluding house rent and local supplementary allowance as an incentive to the police officers/ personnel working in the Special Task Force to go to dangerous and difficult work and 30% additional pay of all other salaries and allowances excluding house rent and local supplementary allowance as an incentive to the driver personnel.
Since the work in this team is very risky, it is in order to provide incentive allowance to the officers/ employees of the police force in accordance with their willingness to join the special task force. In the 6th Pay Commission, the incentive was given on the basis of Basic+ Grade Pay. However, the concept of Grade Pay has been abolished in the 7th Pay Commission. Therefore, it was under the consideration of the government to sanction incentive allowance to the police officers/ staff of the Special Task Force as per the recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission. A decision in this regard is being taken.
