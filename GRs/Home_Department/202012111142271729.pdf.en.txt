Police and Prisons in the State of Maharashtra are departments under the Home Department.
The posts of Police Constable in Police Department and Jail Constable in Prison Department are to be filled up by implementing the recruitment process as per the Government Decision dated 16/06/2011 [Maharashtra Police Constable (Entry into Service) Rules, 2011] and the amendments made by the Government from time to time. Further, the posts of Armed Police Constables in the State Reserve Police Force are subject to the provisions of the Government Order dated 08/10/2012 [Armed Police Constables (Male) in the State Reserve Police Force (Entry into Service) Rules, 2012]. As there is no clear provision in the said Service Entry Rules regarding the validity period of the selection list prepared for recruitment, the procedure of the waiting list, etc., at present, the preparation of the selection list is being carried out under the General Administration Department No. SRV-1097/ PR No. 31/98/16-A, D. 19/03/1999 and No. SRV-1012/ Q. No. 16/12/ 16-A, D. The action is taken as per the instructions in the circular dated 13/08/2014.
Some candidates on the selection list prepared in the recruitment process refuse to appoint a police constable for various reasons. Also, some candidates become ineligible for the post of police constable due to medical reasons. In such a situation, the process of appointment to the post of police constable is done by including the candidates in the waiting list on the selection list as per the requirement. However, there are a large number of shortlisted candidates who are denied appointment/ are disqualified due to medical reasons and lack of required documents as per the recruitment norms. Also, the number of candidates resigning in the near future has also increased. As a result, the number of candidates in the waiting list will be reduced. As a result, the posts of police constables remain vacant despite the recruitment process. The recruitment process for the various posts
