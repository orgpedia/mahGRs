The High Court in Public Interest No. 28/2013 regarding the present action being taken by the Transport Department on vehicles without fitness certificate. The order dated 07.09.2018 expresses dissatisfaction. According to the circular of the Office of the Transport Commissioner, the above-mentioned instructions have been issued regarding the inspection of vehicles whose fitness certificate has expired, but the vehicle is dangerous to drive on public roads. However, the recommendations have not been implemented. In view of this, the following recommendations have been made:
1. d. Between 08.10.2018 and 23.10.2018, special checking drives should be conducted across the state for vehicles that do not have a fitness certificate, but are dangerous to drive on public roads. For the effective implementation of this campaign, the Transport Commissioner should allocate revenue department-wise departments to the Deputy Commissioner of Transport and Joint Commissioner of Transport in the Transport Commissioner's Office and entrust them with the supervisory responsibility of the work.
If the vehicle has a valid fitness certificate in the said drive but the vehicle is found to be defective, the inspecting officer shall suspend the fitness certificate of the vehicle and detain the vehicle at the nearest repair centre and record the inspection report along with the signature of the repair centre driver on the vehicle being received by him for repair.
(3) If the inspection of the vehicle is found to be without a certificate of fitness, the inspection officer shall detain the vehicle at the nearest repair centre and record on the inspection report with the signature of the repair centre driver that the vehicle has been received by him for repair.
4. The reporting officer shall ensure that the vehicles in both the cases referred to above are submitted by the owner to the responding officer from the repair centre after the action is taken. After this, action should be taken under the Maharashtra Motor Vehicle Rules, 45 (8), (9) and (11).
