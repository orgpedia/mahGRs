Read: Additional Director General of Police, Training and Directorate Office, Letter No. Apomani/ Trainee/ Astha-1/ Construction/ 3079/2023, Dy. 18.10.2023 Preamble: A total of 10 Police Training Centres are functioning in the Maharashtra State Police Force to impart basic training to newly recruited police constables and driver constables as well as in-service training to police officials. The 10 training centres have a total capacity of 8,400.
It takes a total of two years for the newly recruited police constables and driver constables in the Maharashtra Police Force to complete the basic training in two sessions of one and a half years and approximately six months for the recruitment process. In this two-year period, 12-15 thousand new posts of police constables and drivers in the police constabulary become vacant, and accordingly, it is necessary to conduct a large number of recruitment processes and trainings. At present, the in-service training of police personnel has been interrupted from June, 2023 as the basic training of newly recruited police constables and driver constables in the State Police Force is going on in full swing in all the police training centers. Training is very important in this field. However, in future also, it will not be possible to take in-service training of police officers as the basic training will continue in full capacity. Therefore, in order to complete the basic training of the newly appointed police officers in time and to provide in-service training to the police officers in the future, both processes will be possible simultaneously. As per the letter dated 18.10.2023, a proposal has been submitted to the government to increase the capacity of the Police Training Center to 2500 in the first phase and 2500 in the second phase and to approve the creation of new facilities. Accordingly, the matter of approval to increase the capacity of police training center by 5000 trainees is under consideration of the government.
Government Decision: Administrative approval is being given by this Government to increase the strength of trainees from 8,400 to 13,400 in the following 10 Police Training Centres. The strength of these trainees should be as follows: 2,500 each in two phases.
