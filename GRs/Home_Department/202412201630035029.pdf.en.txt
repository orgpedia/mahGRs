The Proposal: -
The Force One, Mumbai unit has been formed to prevent terrorist attacks. Officers and commandos of the Force One have to be deployed for security arrangements during the visit of the Hon'ble Prime Minister to the state of Maharashtra, Assembly session, Nagpur as well as at sensitive places. The All India Commando Competition also features officers and commandos from the Force Bun to represent the state of Maharashtra. All of the above locations are manned by Force One officers along with Wab commandos, mess staff and cleaners from the headquarters to arrange for food and cleaning. The security arrangements and the duration of the games are long, resulting in a shortage of mess and cleaning staff at the headquarters, and the remaining mess and cleaning staff at the headquarters are overburdened and unable to complete the work on time. This causes inconvenience to other officers and commandos and puts them under mental and physical stress.
