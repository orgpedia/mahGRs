circular
In view of the Covid-19 pandemic situation, it has been decided to celebrate this year's Diwali in a simple manner. Accordingly, the following guidelines are being issued: In the current religious year, all Covid festivals/ festivals in the state as well as the spread of the disease in these highly contagious cities have been found to be seven to eight in the last month. This year's coming.
Diwali should be celebrated in a very simple manner with full precautions like other festivals celebrated during the Covid period.
Religious places in the state, which were closed due to Covid infection, have not been opened yet. Therefore, it should be ensured that the celebration of Diwali is limited to the household. Children and the elderly should avoid going out of the house during the festival. Also, citizens should avoid crowding and large gatherings, use masks and follow social distancing, so that corona infection/ infection does not increase.
Diwali is considered as the festival of lights and lights. A large number of fireworks are set off during the festival. As a result, air and noise pollution levels increase and the adverse effects on the health of people and animals are seen for a long time after the Diwali festival. Many people affected by the corona disease are afraid of being directly affected by air pollution due to the smoke of firecrackers. Keeping this in mind, citizens should avoid bursting firecrackers this year, it can cause trouble. Instead, the festival should be celebrated by lighting lamps on a large scale.
Any kind of public activities/ programmes during the festival e.g. Diwali morning should not be organized. If it is to be organized, it should be broadcasted through online, cable network, Facebook, etc.
Health related activities/ camps instead of cultural programmes (e.g. Organizing blood donation) should be given priority and through this diseases like Corona, Malaria, Dengue, etc. and their preventive measures should be taken.
