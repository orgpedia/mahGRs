Government circular: The Empowered Committee constituted under the Chairmanship of Chief Secretary in its meeting held on 18/01/2022 has decided as under:
Under the Sagarmala programme, 50% of the project cost is borne by the Central Government. The original budgeted cost of the projects to be taken up under Sagarmala Programme is increasing due to delay in approval due to administrative and technical reasons. The inability of the central government to approve this increased price is causing difficulties in the completion of the project. Therefore, in order to ensure smooth functioning of the projects under Sagarmala programme, the State Government should make available the excess amount due to increase in the rate/ price of the projects in the original budgeted cost of the projects to be taken up under Sagarmala programme, due to delay in sanctioning due to administrative and technical reasons. For this, the Home (Ports) Department should approve more suitable provisions in the budget for the financial year 2022-23 and 2023-24.
