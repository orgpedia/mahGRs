The proposal:
The Naxalites have been waging an armed and violent struggle against the government for the last 35-36 years.
For the police to effectively take strong action against Naxals, it is essential that they get accurate and definite information, including training, arms and ammunition. This information is obtained from confidential sources. There must be a wide network of confidential correspondents to receive such information. The lives of such confidential informants are constantly under threat. But in the face of such a threat, confidential informers are helping the police force as much as possible. According to the information available in the police department, the police force is facing difficulties in creating a wide and extensive network of informers due to the brutal killing of many police correspondents in Gadchiroli district by Naxals on the suspicion of being police informers. The message that the government stands firmly behind the surviving and the families of the police officers who died in the Naxal attack needs to reach the common man. There was a constant demand and follow-up to include the families of such confidential correspondents in government service.
The Committee for Integration and Coordination at the State Government level has been constituted under the Unified Command Mechanism framework after reviewing the strategies and actions taken so far by the Naxal-affected States to curb the increasing Naxal activities. The meeting was chaired by the Chief Minister. The committee As per the directions received in the meeting held on 01.02.2018, the Government was considering to provide direct appointment in Government service to the family of one of the confidential correspondents who died in the Naxalite attack in the Naxalite affected district of Gadchiroli in the post of Class 3 and 4 as per the qualification.
