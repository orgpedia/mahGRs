The Proposal:
Sea level rise over the past decade due to environmental change has exacerbated the severity of coastal haze. Therefore, long-term protection and management of the coast is necessary to prevent erosion of coastal land, protect property, maintain ecological balance and promote tourism, opening up of fisheries, protection and conservation of marine biodiversity through planned management of beaches. In line with this. passed on 8.9.2010. The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved the implementation of Asian Development Bank funded Sustainable Coastal Protection and Management Project (SCPMIP) for the period 2010-2019 with a total outlay of Rs. The estimated cost was Rs 827 crore. According to the budget, the total cost of the project is Rs. 827 crore. Out of this Rs. 480.60 crore from Asian Development Bank. The state government's share was Rs 265.40 crore. As well as Rs. 81 crore was earmarked for the private sector.
The project was planned to be implemented in three phases on MFF (Multi Tranche Financing Facility) basis in the state of Maharashtra from 2010 to 2019. The Maharashtra Maritime Board was the implementing agency for the project. The first phase of the project was planned to be implemented from 2010 to 2013 and the second and third phases from 2013 to 2019. The first phase of the project was carried out from 2011 to 2018.

The second and third phases of the project are expected to be completed by 2019. However, in order to ensure that the proposed sub-project of Phase-II gets adequate time for proper implementation, a Stand Alone Loan for the Asian Development Bank funded Sustainable Coastal Protection and Management Project (SCPMIP) Phase-II and Phase-III has been prepared under the" Maharashtra Sustainable Environmentally Sound Coastal Protection and Management Project." The Maharashtra Maritime Board had submitted a proposal to the government to approve the project within a period of five years.
The preventive measures to be taken under this project are expected to benefit as follows:
1.Environmental protection of erosion prone beaches along the coast of the State from long term protection from sea level rise and sea wave erosion through natural remediation plan.
2. Protection of beach with sand.
3. To increase the usefulness of ports by stopping the process of siltation in the port, to help in smooth navigation by conserving the coast with the help of sand deposited in the path of sea waves and boats.
4. To protect the coastal farmlands, colonies and factories in rural and urban areas directly and indirectly from the stagnant soil erosion, to benefit the people living there and to prevent conversion of fertile land into saline land.
5. Enhance fish breeding by creating suitable habitat for marine fishes and other marine biodiversity.
To promote tourism development through planned management of beaches and protection of coastal cultural and religious sites from sea-level rise and tidal stress, and thereby augmenting sources of revenue generation.
