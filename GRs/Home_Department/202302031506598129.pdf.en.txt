Adequate lighting is essential during this time. However, due to some technical issues, the power supply was disrupted. At that time, taking advantage of darkness, some unwanted incidents like brawls, fights, unnatural relationships, attempts to escape from jail, etc. can happen. As a result, the security of the prison system can be threatened and the life of the prisoner can be threatened.
For this, the security system in the prisons of the state should be modernized, as a separate diesel generator system should be operational for the prisons so that the electricity supply in the prison barracks can be restored through a diesel generator as soon as the power supply is interrupted. 4,23,60, 600/- (Rupees Four Crores Twenty Three Lakhs Sixty Thousand Six Hundred only) for purchase of 34 Diesel Generator Sets (30 KVA). The matter of giving administrative approval to the proposal received by the government under section 1 was under consideration of the government.
