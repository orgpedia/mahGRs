Hence, the State's millets producing units can sell any quantity of millets to other prescribed licensees. In this regard, as per the provisions of Bombay Mill Rules, 1955, Bombay Mill (Control) Act, 1956 and Bombay Mill (Control of Sale, Supply and Price) Order, 1960, the State Excise Department is responsible for the distribution of the mill produced in the State, export to foreign countries, collection of transport duty, export duty, etc. Every year, a millet budget was prepared taking into account the quantity of millet available in the state and with the prior permission of the government, the remaining millet was allowed to be exported to other states or abroad after meeting the needs of the state.
Government Resolution pursuant to the announcement made in the Legislative Assembly during the Budget Session of the Legislature in 2015 regarding the deregulation of the export of millets, No. MPL-1213/ PR No. 559/ Raushu-3, D. Under 4.1.2016, the Collector has been empowered to grant permission for export of millets produced in the state to foreign countries by modifying the existing procedures for export control.

They sell. The sugar mills that have set up distilleries are large enough to
A lot of investment has been made. Liquor produced from this distillation is widely used for industrial and beverage liquor production in the state. The use of alcohol
The ratio is 60:40 and the government gets a lot of revenue from it.
If we look at the data on the production and consumption of rice in the state in the last few years, it is estimated that 35 to 40 lakh maize is produced annually. Of the tonnes of molasses available in the state, distilleries in the state usually need about 32 lakh metric tonnes (m.a.) to produce alcohol. Tons of millets are required and around 2.5 lakh maize is required for animal feed. Tons are required. As per the estimates of the Sugar Commissioner, the current season 2019-20 is likely to see a production of 570.00 Lakh MT. Tons of sugarcane will be desilted, likely from May 22.20. tons of coal will be produced. However, about 40.00 lakh per annum. Tons of oil are needed.
5. the central government. As per the decision dated 2.1.2013, a policy has been announced to blend ethanol with vehicle fuel in the ratio of 10%. After this, after the new central government came to power from May 2014, it has directed to effectively implement the policy of blending ethanol in vehicle fuel. Also, the Central Govt. 18.9.2018 and D. As per the decision dated 18.12.2018
Production of ethanol from B-heavy mill and C-heavy mill from sugarcane juice has been approved. The Ethanol Manufacturers Association of India (EMAI) has demanded a ban on the export of ethanol from the country.
The production and consumption of rice in the state in 2017-18 is estimated to be 35 to 40 lakh maunds per annum. tonnes of wheat is produced in the state. Amongst them
35 lakh for distillation, liquor production and animal feed in the State. Tonnes of millets have been used and out of the remaining millets, 1.77 lakh millets have been procured. 2.53 lakh tonnes in other States. tons of oil are exported abroad. Further, during the six months period from 18th November to 19th April, 2018-19, a total of 45.72 lakh units have been installed. Tons of millet have been produced and 29.18 lakh maize has been procured for distillation and cattle feed in the state. Tons of oil were used. 3.29 LMT of pulses have been exported to other states and abroad.
Considering the flood situation in Western Maharashtra and drought situation in Marathwada, the production of millets is likely to be even lower this year as compared to last year. As a result, the production of alcohol will also be reduced. There will also be a shortage of liquor as this liquor is used for the production of domestic/ foreign liquor, ENA and ethanol. All this is fact.
