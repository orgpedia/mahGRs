To streamline government functioning, secure documents and make decision-making faster and easier, it is necessary to conduct government business through e-office system in all the administrative departments of the ministry as well as in field offices. The General Administration Department has published the Maharashtra Office Rules Manual, 2023, taking into account the changes in the office work system in the changing times. These guidelines are required to be implemented by the Home Department as well as the Subordinate Regional Offices and the instructions are as follows: Maharashtra Office Procedure Manual, 2023 has been made available on the website of the General Administration Department as well as on the dashboard of the e-office. Further, it is to be ensured that the provisions of Maharashtra Office Procedure Manual, 2023 are strictly followed while carrying out day-to-day office work in the Home Department as well as in the Subordinate Regional Offices.
2. Daily mails received by the administrative departments of the Ministry from the field offices and citizens are being received at the Central Post Office of the Ministry. Home Department's Window No. 8 is accepted. The process of scanning the mail received at the central post office and sending it to the concerned offices through the registration branch is being done.
At present, postal mail is not received digitally from the Regional Office under the Home Department and it has to be scanned while delivering the mail through the e-office system. This leads to wastage of time. Therefore, all the following field offices under the Home Department should send all the postal mail except the confidential letter to be sent to the Ministry of Home Affairs through the e-office system.
