Circular: On the demands of the police Patil organizations, Ma. Minister (Home). The meeting was held on 3.12.2020. It was discussed in the meeting that the appointing authority (collector) suspends the police Patil in many places despite the charter that the police Patil can contest the election in the cooperative society. The police have asked the government to clarify on the matter.
2. the subject matter of the case. The guidelines issued on 10th May, 1983 are as follows:
A police officer is the government's representative in the village. Given the stature of his position, job role and responsibilities, he is not expected to involve himself in any political activity. As per Rule 5 (1) of the Maharashtra Civil Services (Conduct of Business) Rules, 1979, Patil is barred from participating in politics or any election to the Legislative Council or local body.
A candidate for the post of Police Patil should not be a member or affiliated to any political party or political organization. Office bearers or members of local bodies can be considered as candidates for the post of Police Patil.
However, he can be appointed to the post of Police Patil only after he actually resigns from the post.
Police Patil are paid honorarium, not salary, so they are expected to have their own separate means of livelihood/ subsistence. If he is engaged in farming or in local business or trade, this work should not be harmful or disruptive to the duties of his post of Police Patil. Therefore, it is unreasonable to expect him not to be associated with any co-operative society during his tenure in general. As a result, a candidate for the post of Police Patil or Police Patil can remain a member or office bearer of a cooperative society or can contest elections for it, in this regard, the Maharashtra Government employees.

The provision of Rule 16 (3) of the Civil Services (Conduct) Rules, 1979, is not applicable to the Police Patil.
These recommendations are being reviewed.
Section 73A of the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960 specifies the disqualification of the committee and its members. Section 73A and other sections of the said Act do not provide for any kind of restriction on police personnel from contesting elections to co-operative societies.
In view of the above, all the appointing authorities (Collectors) are hereby informed that contesting elections to the Co-operative Societies or holding office as an office bearer therein does not constitute disqualification for the post of Police Patil.
