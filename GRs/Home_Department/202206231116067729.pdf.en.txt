Introduction: The Moha tree is found only in the Indian subcontinent, and the Moha trees are found in large numbers in the forests of the state. Since the import of Mohaphula is banned in the state and the process of making liquor from Mohaphula is expensive and unaffordable, the rate of excise duty on this liquor is very low compared to other liquors, but no one is interested in making country liquor from Mohaphula. If a different kind of liquor is allowed to be produced from mohafuls, the demand for mohafuls will increase and create an additional source of income for the tribal brothers. Also, Maharashtra is the leading state in the production of cashew nuts in India. Only cashew nut is considered in the cashew production process. However, they are wasted because the kajubonda is not processed as expected. Making liquor from such waste cashew nuts will create an additional source of income for local farmers as well as women self-help groups collecting cashew nuts. Also, in this process of liquor production, apart from liquor, by-products like animal feed, compost manure etc. will be produced, which will also benefit the farmers and the producing units.
2. Apart from Mohafule and cashew nuts, other fruits/ flowers like banana, raisins, oranges, grapes, pomegranate are also produced in large quantities in the state. Such fruits and flowers are perishable and a lot of horticulture produce is also wasted in natural disasters. Farmers will be directly benefitted if liquor is produced from such perishable fruits/ flowers produced locally in the state. Also, this liquor processing industry will create employment in the state.
3) The rate of excise duty on Indian Made Foreign Liquor is the highest in the country.

The price will be higher. This will limit the sale of alcohol. Therefore, excise duty on alcoholic beverages made from Mohafule and Kajubonda must be levied at a concessional rate.
4. In the state spirit is mainly made from millets/ grains and from that liquor is made. Since 2005, wine made from cashew nuts and mohafula has been designated as' country liquor'. The classification of liquor as" country liquor" limits its marketing and value addition due to limited consumer base. Therefore, it is desirable to give this wine the status of" foreign wine" instead of" country wine."
5. In view of all the above, at present, the Government was contemplating to frame a policy to classify liquor produced from cashew nuts and mohafule as" foreign liquor" instead of" country liquor" and to produce liquor from fruits and flowers along with that product and make foreign liquor from it. The government has taken the following decisions:
Government Decision: The Government has decided to make liquor from locally available products/ fruits/ flowers as follows: 1. It is approved to give the status of" Foreign Liquor" instead of" Country Liquor" to the liquor produced from locally produced products including cashew nuts, mohafule, etc. Alcohol produced from such alcohol should be called" local alcohol."
2. Sample-I license should be granted for the production of alcohol from local fruits/ flowers etc. and these licenses should be charged the same license fee as the Sample-I license fee for distillation of grape juice.
3. PLL license to be granted for making beverage liquor from local fruits/ flowers. Such licences should be charged licence fee similar to the PLL licence fee paid for brandy beverage liquor based on grapes.
4. In case of less alcohol produced as per the availability of fruits/ flowers or as per the requirement, the alcohol produced from one fruit/ flower may be diverted to another fruit/ flower.

Blending in the produced alcohol will be allowed. However, under no circumstances, such newly issued licences shall be allowed to make foreign liquor using mallee and grain-based liquor. Also, the alcohol produced from fruits/ flowers should not be mixed with the alcohol produced from millets/ grains.
The FL-2 license for retail sale of foreign liquor attached to these PLL licenses shall not be admissible.
6. Rate of excise duty on liquor produced from fruits/ flowers Rs. 50/- per litre. Also, the formula of excise duty shall be three times the value of production or Rs. 50/- per proof litre, whichever is higher. Similarly, the Maximum Retail Price (MRP) formula for retail sale is the same as that for Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL). MFL) shall remain as applicable.
The sale of liquor will be allowed through the license of retail liquor of sample FL-2, FL-3, FL-4 and FL-4A.
All permissions/ permissions should be given through a single window scheme.
In accordance with the above proposal, the Government will issue a separate notification to make necessary changes in the existing rules under the Maharashtra Liquor Prohibition Act, 1949.
