Reference: Commissioner, Raushu No. Liquor Quota Allocation/ 112021/21-22/ 5-B, Dy. The letter dated December 9, 2021.
Introduction: Liquor quota is sanctioned by the State Excise Department for the manufacture of liquor to the domestic/ foreign liquor producing units in the State. Liquor quota is allocated to the liquor manufacturers by taking into account their installed capacity, the highest quota used by them in the last 5 years, so that the government revenue is not adversely affected by the closure of liquor production due to lack of supply of liquor. Similarly, if the unit demands more liquor than the installed capacity, the additional liquor is sanctioned to the unit concerned as per the adhoc liquor quota regime. Thus, in order to avoid wastage of time and loss of revenue in the process of obtaining government approval for sanctioning additional liquor quota, it has become necessary to simplify the process in terms of Ease of Doing Business (EoDB) for liquor manufacturers. Accordingly, the matter of simplification of the process of allocation of liquor quota for domestic/ foreign liquor manufacturing was under consideration of the Government.
Government Decision In order to avoid wastage of time and loss of revenue in sanctioning additional liquor quota to the domestic/ foreign liquor producing units of the state as per the government's prior approval for liquor production, and to facilitate the liquor manufacturers in the production process and ease of doing business (EoDB), the following decisions are being taken as per the recommendations of the Commissioner, State Excise:
The system of allocating liquor quota and additional liquor quota for domestic/ foreign liquor production is being abolished.

2. Liquor quota should be made available to domestic/ foreign liquor manufacturing units automatically in proportion to the license fee paid by them at the beginning of the financial year. Also, if the entity pays additional license fee during the same financial year, the enhanced/ additional quantity of liquor will be automatically sanctioned to the entity.
Necessary action should be taken so that the liquor quota sanctioned to the domestic and foreign liquor manufacturers in accordance with the additional license fee paid to them from time to time at the beginning of the financial year as well as thereafter, is recorded in the SCM system from time to time.
The decision will be implemented with immediate effect.
