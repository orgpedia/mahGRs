Government Circular No:- PES-0317/ PR No.91 (Part-1)/ VISA-4
2nd Floor, Madame Cama Marg, Hutatma Rajguru Chowk,
Ministry, Mumbai- 400 032.

Government circular:
Ministry entry passes are issued to the Government servants/ contractual employees/ representatives of political parties from outside the Ministry for a period of one year for entry into the Ministry and vehicle entry passes for a period of one year for entry/ parking in the Ministry are issued to all Government vehicles/ vehicles belonging to the Ministry/ Department of State/ Department of the Ministry. Accordingly, the validity of individual entry passes and vehicle passes issued for the year 2020 is expiring on 31.12.2020.
However, since the individual entry pass and vehicle entry pass applications submitted for renewal are received late, it is likely to take some time for the new entry passes to be issued by taking necessary action on them. Therefore, the validity of personal entry passes and vehicle entry/ parking issued for the year 2020 is being extended till 31.01.2021.
Therefore, the individual entry passes and vehicle entry passes issued for the year 2020 should be accepted for ministerial entry till 31.01.2021 as a special case.
