Introduction: Firecrackers are covered under the Indian Trade Classification (Harmonized System) Code 3604100. The central government has banned the import of firecrackers from abroad. Foreign firecrackers cannot be imported without a permit from the Director General of Foreign Trade (DGFT). The Centre in its letter also said that trade data shows that no foreign firecrackers have been imported from any country as the DGFT has not allowed the import of foreign firecrackers for many years. This means that despite the ban on the import of foreign firecrackers, foreign firecrackers are being brought to the domestic market through illegal means from abroad. Accordingly, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India, has issued instructions regarding the procedures to be followed to prevent the storage, sale and use of unauthorisedly imported firecrackers from abroad. A meeting in this regard was held under the Chairmanship of Secretary, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, New Delhi on 16.10.2020 through video conferencing. In the meeting, Secretary, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, New Delhi has directed the State Government to issue directions to the Director General of Police, all District Collectors, Municipal Commissioners, Commissioners of Police, Superintendents of Police and other agencies to prevent the storage and sale of unauthorisedly imported firecrackers from abroad in view of the upcoming Diwali festival.
