Maharashtra has a coastline of 720 km with 2 major ports and 48 minor ports. Maharashtra has the second longest coastline in India.
Therefore, there is a huge scope for the development of the maritime sector of the state. The state government has made continuous efforts for the development and regulation of the port sector. The Maharashtra Maritime Board has been established under the Maharashtra Maritime Board Policy, 1996 for the control, development and regulation of minor ports along the coast. Since then, the maritime development policy of the state has been developing step by step. At present, the State's" Marine Development Policy-2016" is in operation. Considering the difficulties in implementation of this policy, the revised policy has been issued with the approval of the Cabinet in the Maritime Development Policy-2016. 19.07.2019 was issued as per the decision of the Government.
Since it has been 5 years since the" Maritime Development Policy-2016" was approved and many changes are taking place in the field of" Maritime Development," it is necessary to bring a new Maritime Development Policy keeping in mind the latest reforms in this sector. Accordingly, the Government was considering the issue of approving the new Maritime Development Policy-2023.
