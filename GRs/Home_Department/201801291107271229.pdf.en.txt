Government Resolution No: MIS-0415/ PR No.90/ Raushu-3,
Madam Cama Road, Hutatma Rajguru Chowk,
Ministry, Mumbai- 400 032.
Date: January 29, 2018.
The Proposal:
The State Excise Department is the revenue department of the State Government. As per the provisions of the Maharashtra Prohibition Act, 1949, the department has the power to grant various licenses related to liquor, liquor and raw materials required for these matters. With the growth of industry in the State, the units under the control of the State Production Department for various industrial purposes, which use liquor, liquor and raw materials for these purposes, have increased their production capacity to meet the demand in the market. In order to meet the demands of such elements and to encourage the industries operating in the state of Maharashtra in accordance with the Make India policy of the central government and to create new industries in the state in line with employment generation, it is necessary to avoid administrative delays in obtaining permissions at various levels so that the entrepreneurs and the general public are minimized. Also, the government was considering decentralization of the power of approval of various licenses to be provided by this department to make the functioning of the State Excise Department more people-oriented and efficient and to provide an industry-friendly environment to the liquor manufacturing and selling industry in the state.
Government's decision:
In order to reduce the time taken for the approval of various licenses related to liquor, liquor and raw materials required for these things under the control of the State Excise Department as per the provisions of the Maharashtra Liquor Prohibition Act, 1949, the following powers are being decentralized.
