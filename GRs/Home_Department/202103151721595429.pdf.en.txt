The Proposal:
The interior areas of the prison and the farmlands in Maharashtra are large and it is likely to take some time to set up the necessary CCTV system to monitor the entire area. Therefore, it is necessary that all the officers/ staff on duty for internal security in the jail should be in touch with each other immediately. To establish this link, the prison department needs a walkie-talkie set and if there is a walkie-talkie, it will be possible for all the officers and staff on duty to contact each other in an emergency and take control of the inmates. Also, it will help in avoiding any untoward incident and security will be tightened. For this, it is necessary to purchase protective equipment. In this regard, Additional Director General and Inspector General of Police, Prisons and Correctional Services, Maharashtra State, Pune, vide reference No. The above proposal has been submitted.
However, with regard to the impact of COVID-19 on the economy during the financial year 2020-21, the Budget Estimates for FY 2020-21 have been prepared under Reference No. 1 in finance.
