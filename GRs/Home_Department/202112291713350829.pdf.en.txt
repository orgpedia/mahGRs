Preamble: Policy for grant of license for manufacture of liquor other than mallee and for making Indian and foreign made liquor using such liquor. 1 has been determined by the decision of the government. Also, reference No. 2 here. Ruling on 08.06.2007
As per the decision, the Government announced a scheme of" Grain Based Distillation and Integrated Ingredient Financing" for grant of license for making liquor from paddy and for making Indian and Indian Made Foreign Liquor using such liquor. Thereafter, reference No. 3 According to the decision of the government here, the new grain that is to be distilled. The distilleries who will start production by 31st December 2009 were made eligible for the subsidy.
2. As per this policy, distillation industry was established in the state. However, it was observed that the installed capacity of the said industry was not being fully utilized. The Central Government has announced a scheme for blending of non-hydrous alcohol in fuel up to 20% and an incentive rate for non-hydrous alcohol produced from sugarcane juice and B-heavy mix. Therefore, the alcohol from the mill is preferably used to mix with the fuel. Against this background, the government is considering measures to increase the production of grain-based liquor and to promote this industry.
Accordingly, a Government Resolution dated 25.10.2021 has been issued regarding the use of grain-based liquor for making liquor from other than mallee and for making Indian and Indian Made Foreign Liquor using such liquor.
(iii) Foreign Liquor Rum and Rum based Soft Liquor (Ready to Drink) Since the liquor type is made entirely from milli-based liquor, it would not be appropriate to make it mandatory to use grain-based liquor for the production of rum and also there would be difficulties in the availability of liquor if implemented batch-wise while implementing the Government Decision dated 25.10.2021

Noting that this ratio is therefore appropriate to be maintained annually, the Government decided that the above should not cause difficulties in the implementation of the policy and the rum producers should not be hindered in their production. 25.10.2021 has been submitted to the Government by the Commissioner, State Excise Office vide letter No. 5. Further, while implementing the provisions laid down in the Government Decision dated 25.10.2021, the liquor manufacturing units have to purchase grain-based liquor from outside due to low availability of grain-based liquor, resulting in reduction in the cost of production of the component.
Considering the growth and the adverse impact on the industry as a whole, the Government received requests from the stakeholders for some relaxation in the quantity of grain-based alcohol consumption.
In accordance with the above, the matter of issuing the revised Government Decision by superseding the Government Decision mentioned in Reference No. 4 was under consideration of the Government.
Government's decision:
The use of such liquor by making liquor from other than mallee is hereby superseded by the Government Decision dated 25.10.2021 issued mandating the use of grain-based liquor in specified quantities for the manufacture of Indian and Indian Made Foreign Liquor.
2. Decision is being taken to use grain-based alcohol in the production of Indian and Indian-made foreign liquor by using alcohol produced from other than millets as follows:
1) The decision to make 100% grain-based alcohol mandatory for those who produce liquor from other than mallee and make Indian and foreign-made foreign liquor from it.
2. To take measures to increase the production of grain-based liquor, it is being made mandatory for the units which are using milli-based liquor for producing domestic and Indian Made Foreign Liquor, CL-1 and PLL units respectively, to use at least 20% grain-based liquor for producing domestic and Indian Made Foreign Liquor.
(3) Since rum is produced from sugarcane molasses alcohol, the use of grain-based alcohol for the production of foreign-made rum and rum-based soft liquor shall not be mandatory.
