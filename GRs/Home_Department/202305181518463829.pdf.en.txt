NO. NAVI/ SMART CARD/ ALLANGRUP/ 1220/2022, Cell 9 (3), Office of the Additional Director General and Inspector General of Police, Prisons and Correctional Services, Maharashtra State, Pune.
Proposal dated 15/02/2022
Introduction: The facility of MTNL/ BSNL coin box has been made available to the prisoners in the jails of the state to contact their relatives. With the availability of this telephone facility in the jails, the prisoners are being satisfied with the jail administration as they are able to contact their relatives.
However, the coin box is not easily available in the market at present.
When the coin box is damaged, it cannot be repaired. Also, the prisoners who are kept in the high-security ward, security ward and isolation cells for security reasons have to be taken to the place where the coin box is installed to make calls, so this matter can be dangerous from the point of view of prison security. Therefore, some jail superintendents of the state had requested the Additional Director General and Inspector General of Police, Prisons and Correctional Services, Pune, to allow the use of simple mobile phones instead of coin boxes while providing telephone facilities to the prisoners.
Meanwhile, the Tamil Nadu-based Allen Group, L-69 Manikampalayan Housing Unit, Erode, Tamil Nadu, had submitted a proposal to the Additional Director General and Inspector General of Prisons and Correctional Services, Pune, for permission to introduce smart card phone facility for prison inmates. In pursuance of the proposal, the Additional Director General and Inspector General of Prisons and Correctional Services, Pune, had informed the Divisional Office about the submission of the feedback. Accordingly, all the Deputy Inspector Generals (Prisons) have agreed to the proposal of smart card facility from the Allen Group and have given their opinion that they have no objection to implement it. Accordingly, Additional Director General and Inspector General of Prisons and Correctional Services, Maharashtra State, Pune has also recommended to start SmartCad phone facility at Yerawada Central Jail on a pilot basis.
