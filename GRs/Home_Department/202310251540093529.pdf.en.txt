Maharashtra Rail Infrastructure Development Company (MahaRail) has prepared a Detailed Feasibility Report (DFR) for the Phaltan-Pandharpur new Broad Gauge Railway line project. 1842 crores. This is 50% of the total project cost of Rs. 1842 crore as 50% of Rs. A Government Resolution dated 06.03.2023 has been issued in pursuance of the approval of the Cabinet on 31.01.2023 to provide financial assistance of the State Government for the project and to implement the project through MahaRail.
However, the Railways is yet to agree to implement the project through MahaRail. The delay in the approval of this railway project is likely to increase the cost of the project. Meanwhile, the concerned public representatives are following up with the state government as well as the railway department to expedite the project. Therefore, the government was considering a change in the implementation mechanism of the project. Accordingly, the Cabinet in its meeting held on 10.10.2023 decided as under:
GOVERNMENT DECISIONS:- In pursuance of the decision taken in the Cabinet meeting held on 31.01.2023 regarding the implementation mechanism of the new railway line project Phaltan-Pandharpur, the approval of No. 2 in the Government Decision dated 06.03.2023 issued is being approved to be implemented by the Railway Department.
