CIRCULAR
Hon'ble National Human Rights Commission, New Delhi, in its order dated
16.12.2017, in case No. 2540/13/16/2014 has expressed strong displeasure over the manner
and the attitude of the Secretariat of Government of Maharashtra including the Principal
Secretaries and other Secretaries of the departments in the matters pertaining to violation of
Human Rights. The relevant observations of the Hon'ble National Human Rights
Commission are reproduced below:
"Commission is pained to observe that the secretariat of Government of
Maharashtra including the Principal Secretary, Secretary, and other Secretaries
of the department are taking the matters pertaining to violation of human rights
in a very causal manner. Their lackadaisical attitude is resulting in delay of
redressal of the grievances of the public. There would be no need to bother the
Chief Secretary in each and every matter if the other officers are sensitive to the
rights of the public guaranteed by the constitution. The Commission hopes that
Chief Secretary will issue necessary directions to all the Principal Secretaries and
others to be prompt in submitting replies in all the matters relating to the human
rights on which references are received by them from the NHRC. "
In view of the aforesaid observations of the Hon'ble National Human Rights
Commission, all the Additional Chief Secretaries/Principal Secretaries/ Secretaries and the
Heads of the departments/Organizations are hereby instructed to be very diligent and prompt
in handling the matters pertaining to violation of Human Rights and to be prompt in
submitting the replies in all the matters relating to the Human Rights on which references are
received by them from the Hon'ble National Human Rights Commission.
