Preamble: In the second session of the year 2018, on 19/07/2018, a breach of privilege issue was raised in the House that" the privileges enjoyed by the members of the Legislature in the discharge of their duties towards the people have been violated by the executive and the protection given to the government officers/ employees under Section-353 of the Indian Penal Code has led to an increase in their misconduct towards the members of the Legislature." During the discussion, objections were raised to amend Section 353 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) under the Indian Penal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure (Maharashtra Amendment) Act, 2018, as the punishment for misconduct with public servants is five years instead of two years.

Accordingly, the Committee was constituted as per the decision of the Government dated 05/01/2019. The matter of reconstituting this committee is under consideration of the government and the following decision is being taken.
