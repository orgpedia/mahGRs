The Proposal:
Political parties and social organisations are resorting to bandhs, gheraos, marches, demonstrations and other forms of agitations to draw the attention of the government to various issues of public interest. Therefore, cases are filed against them for violating the prohibitory order and cases are filed by filing a charge sheet in the court. These cases have been going on for a long time. As a result, since the Government has been receiving petitions for withdrawal of cases in various forms of agitations, the cases against various political/ social activists in all cases arising out of political/ social and other mass agitations have been closed. Cases filed prior to November 1, 2014. The decision was taken on March 14, 2016.
However, the. Even after November 1, 2014, the number of various political, social and other mass movements in the state is continuously increasing. As a result, such crimes are on the rise. Petitions are being received from people's representatives and various social/ political organizations regarding the withdrawal of cases in this movement. Hence the cases are increasing. Partial Amendment of the Government Resolution dated 14th March, 2016 and the Government Resolution, Home Department No.PRO-0516/ PR.No.106/ VISA-2, Dy. 30.8.2016 under Section 321 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 for withdrawal of cases related to political and social movements.
