Ministry, Mumbai- 400 032.
Date: October 21, 2022.
Government Resolution, Home Department No. CVA 0187/714/ Pol-5B, dated 4th March, 1991.
Government Resolution, Finance Division No. Wahb-2020/ PR No. 03/2020/ Service-5,
The date is April 20, 2022.
Circular No. CP/ D-7 Br. of Joint Commissioner of Police (Administration), Brihanmumbai. / 522/ 2022, dated 10/5/2022.
Preamble: Government Resolution No. 1. As on 4th March, 1991, subsidy is provided for the travel expenses of police personnel on duty in the buses of BEST of Mumbai Municipal Corporation and the transport undertakings of Pune, Kolhapur, Solapur and other Municipal Corporations. As per the provisions of the said Government decision, the transport allowance was not paid to the police officers/ staff who travelled without ticket for duty in the buses of the transport undertakings of the Municipal Corporations.
The scheme was applicable only to the officers/ employees of Mumbai, Pune, Kolhapur, Solapur and other municipal corporation areas and no transport allowance was paid to these officers/ employees.
The rates of Transport Allowance of State Government and other eligible employees have been revised subject to certain conditions as per the Government Resolution No. 2, Finance Division, No. Vahab-2020/ PR No. 03/2020/ Service-5, dated 20th April, 2022.
In view of the drastic changes in the transport system over time, the Commissioner of Police, (erstwhile) Brihanmumbai has decided to disburse the transport allowance to the police officers/ staff in their monthly salary and not to disburse the reciprocal amount to the BEST administration, as many of the police officers/ staff working in the Brihanmumbai Police Force are travelling by train and their own private vehicles and very few officers/ staff are found to be using the BEST buses and are required to get the transport allowance. In this regard, Joint Commissioner of Police (Administration), Brihanmumbai, CP/ D-7 Br. 522/2022, dated 10/5/2022, all Regional Divisions/ Constituent Offices have been informed to take action for payment of Transport Allowance admissible to eligible employees as per Government Decision, Finance Department, dated 20.04.2022 from the month of June 2022 onwards.
Accordingly, the facility of free travel in BEST buses to all serving officers/ officials of the Brihanmumbai Police Force has been discontinued with effect from June 1, 2022. The Director General of Police, Maharashtra State, Mumbai has recommended that due to the change in the time, there is no need for free travel concession and it would be appropriate to discontinue the said concession and pay the transport allowance to the police personnel as per the rules.
Since most of the police personnel in the force travel by train and their own private vehicles, very few officers/ personnel use BEST buses.
