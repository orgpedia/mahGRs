The Proposal:
The Gateway of India in Mumbai is an important tourist destination from where water transport is carried out using the existing 5 jetties for Elephanta, Mandwa, JNPT, Harbour Cruising. The annual passenger traffic is around 30 to 35 lakh. The existing jetty facility at Gateway is inadequate for passengers and at times, passengers have to cross 3 to 4 boats to reach their desired boat. This poses difficulties for women, children and aged persons. For the convenience of passengers, it was proposed to construct a jetty at the Gateway of India and create facilities for it. However, the Navy objected to it on the grounds of safety and suggested that the proposed jetty be built near the Radio Club.
Accordingly, a proposal for the construction of Radio Club Jetty, new passenger terminal and similar facilities was submitted by the Chief Executive Officer, Maharashtra Maritime Board and the matter of approval of the proposal was under consideration of the Government. Construction of tourist/ passenger jetty, terminal building and similar facilities at Radio Club Mumbai. As per the Home Department's Government Order dated 07.09.2020, the State Budget 2018-19 is Rs. Administrative Sanction has been accorded for Rs. 98,57,15, 057/-. The cost of materials for the jetty project at Radio Club Mumbai under the Sagarmala programme as per the State List for 2021-22 has increased and at present, it is not possible to construct the jetty as per the State List for 2018-19. The Chief Executive Officer, Maharashtra Maritime Board has requested to approve the new budget of Rs 162,98,17,938/-.
