(2) A time bound programme for setting up of modern and fully equipped private testing facilities with the participation of the private sector as per the provisions of Section 56 (2) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 read with Rules 63 to 69 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 should be formulated as a pilot programme. Such centres should be monitored by the Motor Vehicles Department to ensure that they comply with the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 and the rules thereunder.
(3) Disciplinary action under the Maharashtra Civil Services (Discipline and Appeal) Rules shall be taken on priority against the officer and his supervisory officers who have committed wrongful acts in violation of the provisions of the Act and the rules.
4) Vehicle 4.0 should be pursued on a priority basis for development and upgradation of this system.
5) The video footage of the inspection action should be made available to the Regional Transport Officer/ Deputy Regional Transport Officer of the concerned district and the senior officers of the Transport Commissioner's Office supervising them through the live sharing process to directly monitor the work of the certificate verification. If necessary, a proposal should be sent to the government to provide manpower for this action.
6) A fixed time should be given on the appointed date to avoid crowding of vehicles at the inspection centre.
As per Section 56 (2) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, the financial viability of setting up a sample test track in partnership with private entities should be examined taking into account the number of vehicles and the fee structure.
8) Necessary changes should be made in the Vahan 4.0 system to avoid collection of fees before the date of eligibility check and getting the date of appointment without paying the fee.
9) No Objection Certificate should be handled in a model manner by senior officers as prescribed. Also, the facility should be available to the offices/ states receiving No-Objection Certificates, as is the model facility equivalent to the parent department in respect of vehicle inspection.
10) Robost connectivity should be added to the Vehicle 4.0 system. Through this, it is necessary to monitor the work directly by the concerned officers on the online mode.
Since the government spends a large amount of funds on brake test tracks, the inspection should be conducted at private test tracks for renewal of fitness certificates under Section 52 (6) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. A time-bound programme should be chalked out for this.
