Ganeshotsav Guidelines 2020
In view of the infectious situation due to Covid-19, it has been decided to celebrate this year's Ganeshotsav in a simple manner. Following are the guidelines: For public Ganeshotsav, Ganeshotsav Mandals will be required to take due prior permission from the Municipal Corporation/ Local Administration as per their policy.
2. Considering the infectious situation arising out of COVID-19. Mandaps of limited size should be set up in accordance with the orders issued by the court and the policy of the municipal corporation and the concerned local administration regarding the mandaps. Since this year's Ganeshotsav is expected to be celebrated in a simple manner, there should be no pomp and show while decorating domestic and public Ganpati temples.
The height of Ganesh idols should be 4 feet for public pujas and 2 feet for home pujas.
This year, instead of the traditional Ganesha idol, metal/ marble etc. should be worshipped at home. If the idol is eco-friendly, it should be immersed at home.
If immersion is not possible at home, immersion should be done at the nearest artificial immersion site.
If it is possible to postpone the immersion of the Ganesh idol, then the immersion of this idol can be done at the time of Maghi Ganeshotsav immersion or next year's immersion in the month of Bhadrapada of 2021. So that you and your family are protected from the corona epidemic by avoiding crowding for arrival/ immersion.
5. Donations/ contributions for the festival should be accepted if they are voluntary. It should be seen that the display of advertisements does not attract crowds. Also, advertisements with health and social messages should be preferred.
