Introduction: Many prisoners serve long terms in prison. Since most of the detainees are the head of the family, they face problems such as the entire family being detained for a long time, depression, depression, guilt, loss of sensitivity in the family, and the feeling of the prisoner's failure to perform family duties. In such a situation, providing a loan amount to the prisoner for the needs of his family will help in strengthening the family atmosphere by increasing sympathy and love among the family members towards the prisoner. Keeping this in mind, there is an innovative scheme to improve the living conditions of the prisoners and their rehabilitation.
