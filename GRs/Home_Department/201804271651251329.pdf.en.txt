The Proposal:
A large number of passengers travelling in the state use private contract vehicles. The transporters who transport such passengers on private contract basis increase the fares exorbitantly during peak season. Rent of such private vehicles. The Bombay High Court in Public Interest No. 149/2011 was filed. In the petition, The High Court had ordered to fix the rent of private contract vehicle. The Central Institute of Road Transport (CIRT), Pune has been appointed as the nodal agency for the project.
T) Pune has studied and submitted a report on various categories of private contract transport.
The category of contract vehicles used for passenger transport is mainly divided into air-conditioned/ air-conditioned/ sleeper/ sleeping more seating etc.
Each category of vehicle has different motor vehicle tax, fuel cost, maintenance cost, per km running rate and the entire vehicle is booked on a contract basis. Such a contractual licensed vehicle holder is not allowed to carry passengers to different places by giving tickets. Therefore, the government was considering to fix the maximum fare per kilometre for the full train of private contract license vehicles.
Government's decision:
Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) fares are determined by the state transport authority. Considering this fare, the per km fare for the entire bus of a private contract vehicle is the same as the per km fare for the entire bus of the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation. The maximum fare shall not be more than 50% of the fare. For example, the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation

Rent per km per bus of different types of buses of the corporation and private buses of that type.
The maximum fare for a bus for a contract license vehicle is mentioned in the table attached.
2. The maximum fare fixed for private contract license vehicles as above does not mean that the Government has increased the fare for private contract license vehicles. private
The transporters are required to provide transportation facilities to the passengers by charging reasonable fares in a competitive environment. The maximum fare has been fixed to avoid financial squeeze of passengers by increasing the fare on a large scale due to the demand-supply gap during the peak season.
3) The order must be strictly enforced. If the fare is charged more than the above maximum fare, action will be taken against the licensee as per the Motor Vehicle Act/ Rules.
