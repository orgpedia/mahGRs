Reference:- (1) The office of the Director, Directorate of Forensic Science Laboratories, Maharashtra State, Mumbai vide letter No. M/ s/ 2297-97/2021, Dy. 04.05.2021, 2) The Office of the Director, Directorate of Forensic Science Laboratories, Maharashtra State, Mumbai vide letter No. N/ A/ 3540-3541/2021, Dated 13.07.2021.
Introduction: There are a total of 8 Regional Judicial Assistant Scientific Laboratories and 5 Minor Judicial Assistant Scientific Laboratories functioning under the Directorate of Judicial Assistant Scientific Laboratories. There is an aspect that there is not enough manpower available in these workshops to dispose of the pending cases of various disciplines expeditiously. On the other hand, there are Government Institutes of Legal Aid Science in Mumbai, Aurangabad and Nagpur under the Department of Higher and Technical Education. The courses are offered in MSc (Forensic Science) and MSc (Forensic Science). However, there are not enough job opportunities for students after this degree and post-graduate education.
So, considering these two aspects, it is envisaged that in the Directorate of Legal Aid Scientific Laboratories, if the graduate and post-graduate students of the Government Institute of Legal Aid Science are appointed on internship, then those students will get employment opportunities and the Directorate of Scientific Laboratories will also get additional manpower. The idea has been discussed at the government level with the Department of Higher and Technical Education, Home Department as well as the Directorate of Judicial Assistant Scientific Laboratories and the Institute of Judicial Assistant Sciences. A proposal is under consideration for providing internship to the students of MSc (Forensic Science) and MSc (Forensic Science) post-graduates in the scientific laboratories of the Department of Justice.
