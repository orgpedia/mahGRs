2. Mr. Deepa Vaibhav Aga on the actual date 13/01/2021 "Superintendent, District
Prisons have joined the category of "Class-II / Deputy Superintendent, Central Jail." However,
Dates 01/01/2022 including the name of Mr. Deepa Vaibhav Aghe,
Between the last service hours of 01/01/2023 and 01/01/2024, their "cadre"
The date 07/01/2021 is incorrect for "actual date of incorporation" and "date of incorporation."
It has been typed.
3. Hence, "Superintendent, District Jail, Class-II / Deputy Superintendent, Central Jail."
Dates of cadre officers 01/01/2022, 01/01/2023 and 01/01/2024
The last services of the day are included in the jaytathis, Shriman. Dipa Vaibhav in Aage's "Cadre
The actual date of incorporation and the date of incorporation are the same as the date "07/01/2021."
Instead, it should read "13/01/2021."
