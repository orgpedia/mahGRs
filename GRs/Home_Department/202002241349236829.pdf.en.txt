The Proposal:
The main function of the Civil Defence Organization is to train the general public/ government and semi-government office staff in disaster management, the important work of providing necessary assistance to the citizens and their rescue is done before the rescue/ relief team reaches the accident site in the first few hours after the accident.
The training provided by the Civil Defence Force is mainly in the form of basic training (5 days) and various courses of advanced training (6 days each). The training is imparted to civilians who are willing to volunteer for civil defence duties. Most of the trainees take this training with the aim that it will be useful for them to get a job in the future.
It will be more useful if trainees are given training like diploma instead of short duration training.
If a 1-year diploma course is started by combining the training given by the Civil Defense Force, the number of citizens taking this training will increase and this training will also be useful for them to get jobs in the future. It will also be more useful in emergencies. Against this backdrop, the Directorate of Civil Defence has submitted a proposal to the Government under a letter of reference for grant of approval for starting a Diploma course in Disaster Management at Civil Defence Training College, Mumbai. The matter of granting recognition to this diploma course was under consideration of the government.
Government's decision:
Citizens need to be provided with immediate first aid in the event of a disaster occurring in the state. For this, the government has decided to start a diploma course in disaster management at the Civil Defense Training College, Mumbai under the Directorate of Civil Defense.
