Topic: Ganesh Chaturthi 2021
This year's Ganeshotsav in a simple way considering the contagious situation caused by Covid-19
It was decided to celebrate. Following are the guidelines: :
For public Ganeshotsav, Ganeshotsav Mandals will be required to take due prior permission from the Municipal Corporation/ Local Administration as per their policy.
Limited number of mandaps should be set up in line with the policy of the Municipal Corporation and the concerned local administration regarding the pandals in view of the contagious situation arising out of COVID-19. Since this year's Ganeshotsav is expected to be celebrated in a simple manner, there should be no pomp and show while decorating domestic and public Ganpati temples.
The height of Ganesh idols should be 4 feet for public pujas and 2 feet for home pujas.
This year, instead of the traditional Ganesha idol, metal/ marble etc. should be worshipped at home. If the idol is eco-friendly, it should be immersed at home. If immersion is not possible at home, immersion should be done at the nearest artificial immersion site.
5. Donations/ contributions for the festival should be accepted if they are voluntary. It should be seen that the display of advertisements does not attract crowds. Also, advertisements with health and social messages should be preferred.
Health related activities/ camps instead of cultural programmes (e.g. Organizing blood donation) should be given priority and through this awareness should be created about Corona, Malaria, Dengue, etc. diseases and their preventive measures as well as cleanliness.
7. Other restrictions as per circulars issued from time to time regarding Level of Restrictions for Breaking the Chain shall continue to remain in force. There will be no relaxation on Ganeshotsav.
8) Ensure that there is no crowding while organizing aarti, bhajan, kirtan or other religious programs. Also, rules and regulations regarding noise pollution should be strictly followed.
9.Maximum arrangements should be made to provide the facility of darshan of Shri Ganesh online, through cable network, website and Facebook etc.
10. Adequate arrangements for disinfection and thermal screening should be made in Ganpati mandaps. Special attention should be paid to the physical distance and the observance of hygiene rules (masks, sanitizers, etc.) for the devotees who want to come and visit physically.

11. Arrival and immersion processions should not be taken out. In the traditional method of immersion, the aarti done at the place of immersion should be done at home and stay at the place of immersion for the shortest possible time. Children and senior citizens should avoid going to the immersion site for safety. The processions for immersion of all domestic Ganesh idols in the entire chali/ building should not be taken out together.
Artificial ponds should be created for the immersion of Ganesh idols with the help of the Municipal Corporation, various boards, housing societies, public representatives, NGOs, etc.
