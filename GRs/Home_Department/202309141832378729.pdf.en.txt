The Proposal:
Political parties and social organizations follow the path of agitation in the form of gherao, rallies, demonstrations, etc. to draw attention to various issues of public interest. Therefore, a case has been registered against them. The charges have been filed in court. The Government has already taken a policy decision to withdraw the cases of offences arising out of political and social agitations in which chargesheets have been filed till 30th June, 2022 and issued orders under the Government Order No. 2 in this regard. However, at present, the date for withdrawal of cases has expired till June 30, 2022, and in the subsequent period also, chargesheets have been filed in some offences. Accordingly, the government was considering to extend the period of withdrawal of cases filed in connection with political and social movements.
Government's decision:
The cases in which chargesheets have been filed in the cases of political and social movement till August 31, 2023, are subject to the Government Decision No. 1.
