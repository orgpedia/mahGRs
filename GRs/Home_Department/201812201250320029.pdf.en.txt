Preamble: As per the instructions issued by the Government Circular dated 06.10.2017 of the Home Department and the Government Circular dated 07.05.2014 of the General Administration Department, the officers/ employees of the Ministry are required to affix their official identity cards on the facade. All the heads of establishments of the administrative departments of the Ministry have been directed to bring the matter to the notice of the officers/ staff of the Ministry under them and ensure strict implementation of the said instructions. However, it is observed that many of the officers/ staff of the Ministry are not strictly implementing the instructions. It has also come to notice that the government officials/ employees/ visitors outside the Ministry are carrying the Ministry's entrance plastic pouch ribbon in their pockets or bags while going out of the Ministry. Therefore, plastic pouches with ribbons do not accumulate in full numbers at the ministry gate. This is not a security issue.
Therefore, from the security point of view of the Ministry, the Government is issuing the following instructions.
Circular: In view of security at Mantralaya/ New Administration Building, the procedure of issuing entry passes to visitors at the entrance of Mantralaya has been changed. The entry pass issued to visitors and field level officers/ staff with plastic pouch ribbon shall be mandatorily affixed on the facade till they are present in the Mantralaya/ New Administration Building. Also, plastic pouches should be returned with ribbons to the police deployed at the entrance. The security department of the ministry should ensure that it is implemented effectively. Also, as per the circular of the General Administration Department, it has been made mandatory for all government officials/ employees of the state government to put their identity cards on the facade while in office. Accordingly, the officers/ employees of the Ministry are required to affix their government identity cards on the facade.
(2) All the Heads of Establishments of the Administrative Departments of the Ministry shall bring the matter to the notice of the officers/ staff of the Ministry and the establishments of the Regional Offices under them and the instructions shall be strictly implemented.
