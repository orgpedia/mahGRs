The basic pay and dearness allowance at the rate of one and half times of the permissible salary shall be paid to the police officers/ staff working in the sensitive areas of Naxal affected Gadchiroli, Aheri (Police District) and Gondia districts (including State Reserve Police Force, Bintari Sandesh Department, Motor Transport Department, Crime Investigation Department, Anti-Corruption Bureau, Transport Department, Special Task Force, Anti-Naxal Operations, State Intelligence Bureau etc.). Similarly, in Gondia district, the serial number (4) is given as D. All India Service Officers and State Service Officers/ Employees working in Police Stations/ Police Sub-stations/ Armed Reserve and Offices as determined by the Government by the Government Order dated 18/2/2011 should be paid salary and Dearness Allowance at the rate of one and a half times of the basic pay admissible to them. That is, the officers/ staff of various branches of the police force in the state should be given salary and dearness allowance at the rate of one and a half times the permissible salary for the period of service, considering the risky work they have to do till they are working/ deployed in the sensitive areas.
The benefit of one-time promotion is admissible to the officers/ employees of the State Intelligence Department wherever they are working in the State. However, the nature of work of the officers/ staff working in Gondia and Gadchiroli districts is very risky. Therefore, the officers/ staff of the State Intelligence Department working in the sensitive areas of the district should be given the benefit of one-time promotion or one-and-a-half times of the permissible salary and dearness allowance, whichever is higher, at the rate of one-and-a-half times of the permissible salary as in the case of officers/ staff working in the sensitive police stations/ police sub-stations/ armed remote areas.
