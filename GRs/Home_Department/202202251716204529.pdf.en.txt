The Proposal:
The prison premises and farmlands in Maharashtra are large and it is likely to take some time to set up the necessary CCTV system to monitor the entire premises. Therefore, it is necessary that all the officers/ staff on duty for internal security in the jail should contact each other immediately. To establish this contact, the prison department needs a walkie-talkie set and if there is a walkie-talkie, all the officers and staff on duty can contact each other to get control of the prisoners, help prevent any untoward incident and keep the security system in place.
For this, it is necessary to purchase a walkie talkie set for faster communication. In this regard, Additional Director General and Inspector General of Police, Prisons and Correctional Services, Maharashtra State, Pune, vide reference No. 4 A proposal has been submitted for the purchase of walkie talkie sets.
