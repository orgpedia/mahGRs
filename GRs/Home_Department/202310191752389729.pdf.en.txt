Introduction:- After the increase in the rate of excise duty on beer, the sale of beer is decreasing and the graph of beer sales and the resultant government revenue is decreasing. Also in foreign/ country liquor variety the amount of alcohol is more than beer. A representative of the beer industry has submitted to the government the problems faced by the beer industry as the price of beer does not attract consumers to drink beer as the rate of excise duty on beer is higher than other liquors when compared on the basis of alcohol content. It has also been stated that after the reduction in the excise duty on beer by other states, those states have benefited from the increase in revenue. Accordingly, a study group was being set up by the government to submit recommendations to increase the state's revenue through the beer industry.
GOVERNMENT DECISIONS:- The Government is pleased to approve the constitution of the following Study Group under the Chairmanship of Additional Chief Secretary (State Excise) to submit recommendations with a view to increase the revenue of the State through the beer industry.
