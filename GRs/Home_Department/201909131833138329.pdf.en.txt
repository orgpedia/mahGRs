Introduction: Due to the increasing population, increasing industrialization, existing small and big industries in the Mira-Bhayander-Vasai-Virar Municipal Corporation limits, the settlement of workers is increasing in the area. The police commissionerate is required for the jurisdiction of the two municipal corporations of Mira-Bhayander and Vasai-Virar. Accordingly, the Director General of Police, Maharashtra State, Mumbai submitted a proposal for Mira-Bhayander-Vasai-Virar Police Commissionerate. Mira-Bhayandar- The Virar Municipal Corporation (VMC) has been witnessing a rise in the number of crimes and frequent law and order problems. In order to effectively curb it and considering the geographical area, it is necessary to create a new" Mira-Bhayander-Vasai-Virar" separate police commissionerate by dividing the Superintendent of Police, Thane Rural and the Superintendent of Police, Palghar. The Mira-Bhayander-Vasai-Virar region is witnessing a steady rise in various types of crimes due to the increase in population as well as urbanisation and industrialisation. Crime in the area has increased, with gang-related crimes such as burglary, theft and robbery on the rise. The number of foreigners living in the area has increased.

It's mainly growing. Also, as foreign nationals are increasingly involved in cybercrime, fraud, and drug-related crimes, the rate of crimes against these foreign nationals is increasing. With the creation of the new Police Commissionerate by increasing the police manpower in the area, the easy and convenient police services to the people of the area will be more convenient and beneficial in dealing with the complaints of the citizens of the area.
The population of Mira-Bhayander-Vasai-Virar region as per 2011 census was around 20.46 lakh, while considering the growing number of industries and migrant workers, the estimated population of the region as on May 2019 is around 44.66 lakh.

With the increasing number of crimes and the consequent shortage of manpower in the police force, it has become difficult to control such crimes. A new police commissionerate, Mira-Bhayander-Vasai-Virar, was under consideration to facilitate effective prevention of crime and maintenance of law and order by responding in a short time to cases related to crime in this jurisdiction. Accordingly, the following resolution was adopted:
