Introduction: Many liquor outlets in the state are named after deities, national figures and forts. The forts of Maharashtra are witness to the golden history of the state and it is necessary to maintain the sanctity of these forts. On this It has been brought to the notice of the government that the names of deities, national figures and forts are being denigrated by the people's representatives and various organizations and this is causing denigration of religious/ social/ historical places of faith. It has also been requested to prohibit the names of deities, national figures and forts/ forts from being used by such liquor vends as it hurts the sentiments of the people and vitiates the religious and social atmosphere. The government has also promised to take action in this regard.
The matter was under consideration of the government to issue directions to the concerned.
Government Decision: In our country, religious practices are allowed and different castes and religions are practiced.
Everyone has faith in the forts/ forts that are witness to the golden history of the state as well as the men of the nation. Therefore, using the names of Deities, Saints and Greats, Rashtra Purushas and Forts/ Forts in the name of liquor vends would lead to denigration of such Deities, Saints and Greats, Rashtra Purushas/ Greats and Gadakillas, besides hurting religious and social sentiments. As a result, the social environment of the state was vitiated. Respecting the forts and national heroes of the state, as well as the religious beliefs of all, maintaining social harmony, is our primary duty. Therefore, the establishment in which liquor is sold or served in any way in the state should not be named after the deities/ religious places of all religions.
