Read: 1. PLN 1209/ PR No.249/ Ports-2, dated 26.10.2010. MIS-0117/ Q.No.04/ Ports-2, dated:- 26.03.2020.
Government Resolution No. BGT-0822/ No.68/ Ports-2, dated:- 17.02.2023
Under the Asian Bank-assisted Sustainable Coastal Protection and Management Investment Programme, the Maharashtra Maritime Board was being funded on a 30% share (grant-in-aid) from the state and 70% share (loan) from the Asian Development Bank. Since 2018, the Maharashtra Maritime Board has been facing technical difficulties in disbursing funds under the head of Asian Development Bank 6711-0015. Accordingly, the Government was considering opening a new Account Head instead of 6711-0015 under the Asian Bank assisted Sustainable Coastal Protection and Management Investment Programme.
Government Decision: Under the Asian Bank assisted Sustainable Coastal Protection and Management Investment Programme, the Government is approving the opening of new independent accounting heads for providing funds to Maharashtra Maritime Board on 30% equity (grant) basis from the State and 70% equity (loan) basis from the Asian Development Bank.
