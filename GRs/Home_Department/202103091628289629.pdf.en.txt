Devotees from all over Maharashtra throng to the Shiva temple at Vaijnath, Trimbakeshwar, Aundha-Naganath and other places. But this year, considering the contagious situation of Covid-19, it is necessary to celebrate Mahashivratri in a very simple way. Accordingly, all the temple trustees/ managers should take special care that there is no crowd in the temple for darshan and social distancing is followed.
Every year on the occasion of Mahashivratri, a large number of worshipers are performed in the Shiva temple and many devotees come to visit it. But this year, considering the contagious situation of Covid-19, it is necessary for the administration to take preventive measures and create awareness with the help of local people's representatives and NGOs so that the devotees do not go out of the house and perform the puja at home.
To prevent the spread of COVID-19, only 50 devotees will be able to visit each Shiva temple at a time in order to follow social distancing inside the temple, so the concerned trustee or manager should take appropriate measures. Also, the temple management should ensure that disinfection arrangements, social distancing and hygiene rules (masks, sanitizers, etc.) are followed in the surrounding areas.
The temple manager and the local administration should take special care that there is no crowd of garland and flower sellers in the temple premises on the day of Mahashivratri and the rules of social distancing are strictly followed. Similarly, on the occasion of Mahashivratri festival, the policy of the concerned local administration regarding the mandap
Limited pavilions should be built in harmony with them.
