Circular:
If a complaint of defrauding depositors is received or otherwise filed, an offence is registered under the Maharashtra Protection of Interests of Depositors (Financial Institutions) Act, 1999, along with relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code. In order to determine the criminal liability of the accused in such offences, along with criminal proceedings, it is necessary to take time-bound action with a view to refunding the deposits to the victims of such offences, as per the provisions of the said Act. Accordingly, detailed instructions are being issued in this regard as there is a need to have a well-defined and definite procedure regarding the action to be taken in such cases.
1. The number of complainants in cases of fraud against depositors is very large. Most of the time, it is observed that not all the defrauded depositors come forward to lodge a complaint. This does not explain the extent of the crime.
Therefore, the concerned police unit head should give a public announcement in a leading newspaper so that the depositors can come to know about the action being taken on the fraud committed by this financial institution and the depositors can come forward to file a complaint.
The depositors who are aggrieved in such offences should fill in the Annexure-I attached along with the details of their deposits and the required collateral. This will help in getting details of total depositors and their losses.
Offences in which the provisions of the Maharashtra Protection of Interests of Depositors (in Financial Institutions) Act, 1999, apply.

The assets of the financial institution concerned need to be seized immediately to return their deposits to the victims. For this, there is a provision for confiscation of money or other property deemed to have been acquired in one's own name or in the name of any other person from the deposits collected by the financial institution concerned in the first place.
However, the said Act provides for confiscation of assets (movable and immovable) of the promoters, directors, partners, managers or members of the said financial institution if it is found that the assets or money are not available for confiscation or not sufficient to repay the deposits.
In accordance with the said provision of the Act, the proposal required for notification of the Government under Section 4 (1) should be submitted to the concerned Collector's Office by filling up the" Annexure 2" attached with the concerned Police Unit Chief (excluding Brihanmumbai) and a copy of the same should be submitted to the Additional Director General of Police (Economic Offences), State of Maharashtra, Mumbai. The Additional Director General of Police (Economic Offences) should examine such proposals and submit them to the government with his opinion immediately.
As per the" Annexure 2" attached with the proposal for the jurisdiction of the Brihanmumbai Police Commissionerate, the Joint Commissioner of Police (Economic Offences Wing) and the Joint Commissioner of Police (Law and Order) should conduct the necessary investigation and submit their recommendations to the government through the Collector.
After receiving such proposal, the concerned Collector shall examine the proposal and submit it to the Government within 15 days along with the details of the competent authority to be appointed and the recommendations to be supported.
(5) A notification is issued in the Gazette after the approval of the Government on the proposal received at the Government level. Thereafter, it is mandatory to apply to the Special Court within 30 days with the necessary affidavit from the competent authority as per Section 5 (3) of the Act.
In view of this time frame and the urgency of the judicial process, the competent authority and the officers of the Economic Offences Wing should maintain proper coordination. Special attention should be paid to this by the supervisory authorities.
