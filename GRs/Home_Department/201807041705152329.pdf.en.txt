Government Corrigendum No: MPL-1213/ PR No. 559/ Raushu-3
Hutatma Rajguru Chowk, Madam Cama Marg,
Ministry, Mumbai- 400 032.
Date: July 4, 2018.
Read the government's decision: January 4, 2016.
The decision has been taken under the decision of the government to give the authority to the district collector to allow the export of the rice produced in the state to the foreign country by fulfilling the existing rules and the things mentioned in the government decision.
Considering the location to be fixed by the state's millets exporting unit for storing millets, the increased cost of transportation from this place to the nearest port in the state and the relatively cheaper export from the nearest port in another state, the government has taken the decision with a view to avoid fuel and pollution losses. (b) (10) of 4th January, 2016 is being amended as under:
(b) (10)" Export to a foreign country is to be made preferably from a port within the State. However, if requested by the stakeholders, a decision will be taken at the government level based on the facts of the export from the foreign port. "
