Preamble: Some liquor/ liquor/ beer producing units in the State give their license to other units to operate on rent or sub-let basis. Also, some liquor producing units in the state produce their own brands from other units through tie-ups or similar contractual arrangements. Liquor licences are the prerogative of the state government. Therefore, the government has issued a notification. As per November 16, 2011, it has been provided that if any person is allowed to operate a licence under any agreement or arrangement, with the prior permission in writing of the Government or the Commissioner, as the case may be, the licence shall be granted or renewed or continued as a privilege fee to be paid on the basis of such licence rent, sub-let or lease, whichever is higher. However, the Maharashtra Prohibition of Liquor Act, 1949 and the rules thereunder apply only to the Model I, PLL and CL-1 licences and do not apply to the BRL licences. Also, the Maharashtra Prohibition Act, 1949 and rules thereunder do not specifically provide for a tie-up agreement.
The Maharashtra Prohibition of Liquor Act, 1949 and rules made thereunder do not specify the terms and conditions and eligibility criteria for grant of licence to the State Excise Department for manufacture of liquor/ liquor/ beer to be operated through hire/ lease/ tie-up or other similar contractual arrangements. Therefore, in order to bring uniformity in all such licences, it was under the consideration of the Government to define the terms/ conditions and eligibility criteria for the grant of lease/ sub-lease agreement/ tie-up agreement or other similar agreements for the licensee entities namely Sample-I/ PLL/ CL-1/ BRL.
Government Decision: The eligibility criteria and terms/ conditions for the Fare/ Purchase Agreement/ Tie-up Agreement or any other similar agreement for Sample-I/ PLL/ CL-1/ BRL units under the State Excise Department are as follows.
