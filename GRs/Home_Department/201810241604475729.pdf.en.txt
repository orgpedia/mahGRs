Separate seniority list of candidates for the post of Clerk-Typist sponsored by the Maharashtra Public Service Commission in the offices of the Director, Directorate of Complaints, in the Brihanmumbai Division (Headquarters, Deputy Director, Konkan Range, Mumbai and Assistant Director and Public Prosecutor, Brihanmumbai) and other Clerk-Typist candidates in the Regional Offices, except the candidates sponsored by the Maharashtra Public Service Commission, should be maintained.
A total of 305 posts are sanctioned in the Clerk-Typist cadre under the Director, Directorate of Grievances. Out of these posts, the number of posts of Clerk-Typist 28 (including the post of Cash Manager) in the Brihanmumbai Division and 277 Clerk-Typist in the rest of Maharashtra, excluding Brihanmumbai, has been fixed as per the figure approved by the Government Resolution at Reference No. 4. Accordingly, separate points should be named for these two cadres and separate service seniority lists should be maintained.
3. Maharashtra Public Service Commission (MPSC) sponsored candidates of Brihanmumbai Division should be dealt with as per the Government Notification, General Administration Department, dated 31.05.2006, in accordance with the Brihanmumbai Government Office Clerk-Typist (Group-C) (Service Entry) Rules, 2006. Except for the candidates who have been approved by the Maharashtra Public Service Commission, the rules for admission to the service prescribed under the Government Notification, General Administration Department, dated 06.06.2017, for other posts in the Clerk-Typist cadre should be followed.
4. A total of 43 posts of Senior Clerical Cadre are sanctioned on the establishment of Directorate of Grievances. 6 posts should be reserved for promotion to the post of Senior Clerk in the Brihanmumbai Division from the Clerk-Typist cadre sponsored by the Maharashtra Public Service Commission. However, as per the Government Notification, General Administration Department, dated 31.05.2006, Clerk-Typist (Group-C) in Government Offices in Brihanmumbai (Entry into Service) Rules, 2006, candidates other than Maharashtra Public Service Commission (MPSC) sponsored candidates will be given two-tier opportunities of promotion (e.g. Peon- Clerk Typist and Clerk- Typist- Senior Clerk) will be available. Accordingly, action should be taken to give separate promotions to clerks and typists in the rest of Maharashtra in 37 sanctioned posts of senior scribes from their respective cadres. For this, separate point names and seniority lists of both the cadres should be kept.
(5) A common/ combined seniority list of senior clerks of the Brihanmumbai Division and senior clerks of the rest of Maharashtra should be maintained for promotion to the post of" Superintendent," who is the nearest senior to the post of Senior Clerk. However, the transfers of senior clerks in the Brihanmumbai area should be limited to the Brihanmumbai area and the transfers of senior clerks in the rest of Maharashtra, except for Brihanmumbai, should be limited to the rest of Maharashtra.
