Read:- Chief Executive Officer, Maharashtra Maritime Board, Mumbai's letter No. Mamebo/ Muka/ Abhi 4/ Nariman P.O/ 387 dated 30.06.2018
The Proposal:
The Public Works Department is planning to build a memorial for Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in the sea. Since the memorial is being built in the sea, it is necessary to provide boat service for the tourists coming there. At present, the number of tourists and boats coming to the Gateway of India causes traffic jams. Also, there is no scope for expansion due to space constraints and security directives from the Navy. Also, the distance of the monument from the Gateway of India is about 14 km. The memorial of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj is 3 km away from A.C.P.A Nariman Point. Therefore, it is necessary to construct a jetty at NCPA Nariman Point, Mumbai. Construction of jetty and other facilities at NCPA Nariman Point for passengers from Nariman Point to the memorial of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. The proposal for approval of the budget of Rs. 393,22,94, 444/- was submitted by the Maharashtra Maritime Board and the proposal was under consideration of the Government.
Government's decision:
Construction of jetty and other facilities at NCPA Nariman Point for passengers from Nariman Point to the memorial of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj 393,22,94, 444/- subject to approval of Central Government.
