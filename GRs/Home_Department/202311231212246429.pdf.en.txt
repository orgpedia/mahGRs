Introduction:- Gharapuri Island located in Taluka Uran of Raigad district is a world tourist destination. Every year, about 8 to 10 lakh domestic and foreign tourists travel by boat from the Gateway of India (Mumbai) to Gharapuri to see the historical caves (Elephanta). At Shetbandar jetty, passengers can take a boat to six places to climb down. During peak hours, the jetty is short of space for passenger boats, forcing them to wait for the jetty to be vacated, and the steps to the jetty are in a dilapidated condition. As a result, there is a possibility of accidents to passengers during rush hours. Similarly, there is lack of basic facilities for passengers/ tourists at the jetty. The footpath to the jetty is narrow and commuters/ tourists find it difficult to walk on the road as the mini-train runs on the footpath and there are shops on the side of the road from the front. For this, it is very important to develop the jetty at Shetbandar, provide basic facilities to the passengers and widen the footpath.
The proposal has been sent to the Maharashtra government for approval.
