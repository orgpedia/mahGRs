The business of the mill that was stopped and due to the sale of the mill from the sugar factory
The question of storing their mills will be solved, the problem of pollution will not arise and the farmers who depend on the factories will definitely benefit if the prices come up for the sale of mills.
4. After lifting of the ban on export of mallee as above, there should be a centralized control on the export of mallee so that the production of mallee and liquor and the government revenue on alternative beverage liquor is not adversely affected and there is no shortage of alcohol for sanitizer production.
