2) Letter No. MD/ CA/ 2991-92/17, dated 03.05.2017 from the Director General, Directorate of Forensic Science Laboratories, Maharashtra State, Mumbai. Preamble: Under the Directorate of Forensic Science Laboratories in the State, with its headquarters at Mumbai, 8 Regional Laboratories are functioning at Mumbai, Nagpur, Pune, Aurangabad, Nashik, Amravati, Nanded and Kolhapur. In recent times, criminals have been using sophisticated materials and methods while committing crimes and in order to thwart those tendencies, the cases filed have been chemically analyzed and handed over to the investigating agencies from the point of view of social interest and alternatively, to the police. Directorate of Forensic Science Laboratory has a vital role to provide timely scientific evidence of importance to the justice delivery system.
With a view to provide timely scientific evidence of importance to the investigating agencies and the justice delivery system from the point of view of social interest by conducting chemical analysis of the cases filed to thwart the tendencies of criminals and to reduce the burden of pending cases on the existing Regional Forensic Science Laboratories to dispose of the cases on priority and to increase the direct rate of criminal prosecution, the Government has decided to establish 5 new mini Forensic Science Laboratories in the State comprising two departments of Biology and Toxicology.
