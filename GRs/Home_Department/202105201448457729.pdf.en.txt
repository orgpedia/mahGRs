Ministry, Mumbai- 400032.
The date is May 20, 2021.
Preamble: Due to the lockdown due to spread of COVID-19, the movement of the Corporation was closed from 23.03.2020, except for essential transport of the NMC, as decided by the National Disaster Management Authority. As a result, the corporation has been deprived of income and the burden of its fixed expenses has fallen on the corporation every month. Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) has been given permission to transport goods for carrying essential and other items in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic. The internal structure of the passenger vehicles available with the corporation has been changed to convert them into freight vehicles. The Corporation has started the freight business from 21.05.2020 and is receiving very good response. The Corporation has so far converted about 950 passenger vehicles into goods vehicles and transported about 2 lakh metric tonnes of cargo through about 30,000 trips. Considering the above performance of the State Road Transport Corporation, the government was considering various measures to increase the income of the RTC. Accordingly, the following orders are being issued as per the decision of the Cabinet.
Government Decision: Considering the goods transport vehicles available with the State Transport Corporation, the State Transport Corporation should be given 25 per cent of the freight traffic through private transporters after conducting tender process through other departments except Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Protection Department. 25% of the work should be given to the private transporters selected through the tender process of the departments at the rate permissible. For this, the state transport corporation will not be required to participate in the tender process.

After the termination of the freight contract by these departments, the concerned department should ask the State Transport Corporation to provide freight services at the old approved rate until the process of selecting the freight carrier is completed by conducting a new tender process.
Accordingly, if the corporation agrees, the work should be given to the corporation.
The Tyre Retreading Plant of the Corporation should restore 50 percent of heavy and large passenger vehicles of government transport undertakings, municipal transport services and other government enterprises.
4) Maintenance and repair of heavy and large passenger vehicles of the government should be done in the divisional workshop of the corporation.
