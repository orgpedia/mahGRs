Similarly, the police stations should keep an updated list of all senior citizens living in their limits, especially senior citizens living alone.
The police will keep a friendly eye on senior citizens. The police should take the help of social organizations to ensure that the representative of the police station along with the social worker or volunteer regularly visits the lonely and infirm senior citizens for goodwill.
