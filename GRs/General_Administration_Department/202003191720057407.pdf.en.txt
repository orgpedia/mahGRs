Bengaluru: The State government has taken several steps to contain the spread of COVID-19. As part of this preventive plan, the government was considering a ban on government meetings to prevent the spread of coronavirus in state offices and to prevent the infection of state officials/ employees. In this regard, the following recommendations are made:
Meetings should not be held by the administrative departments of the ministries and offices under their control for the period until the outbreak of the corona virus is completely controlled.
Since it is a contagious disease, meetings should be held only if it is mandatory.
Also, in order to avoid the spread of the virus, the officers/ staff invited to the meeting should be careful to keep adequate distance while arranging the meeting so that they do not come in contact with each other.
(3) However, all the Ministries/ Departments as well as all the State Government offices under the control of the Ministry shall comply with the said instructions.
