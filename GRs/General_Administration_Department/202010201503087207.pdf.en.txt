Mantralaya, Mumbai- 400032

Circular: Proposals for promotion of senior officers are considered in the meeting of the Establishment Board. Detailed instructions on how to submit proposals for taking decisions in such meetings have been given under the Government Decision dated 1st August, 2019 of the General Administration Department. However, after receiving proposals from most of the departments, it is noticed that there are various shortcomings in them. In order to resolve the objections, the concerned department is informed to complete the errors and accordingly the departments waste time in completing the errors. The whole process was delayed. In this regard, holding coordination meetings with the officers of the department will help in speeding up the promotion process and resolving the pending issues and grievances of the employees. In this regard, it has been decided to hold monthly review meetings with Joint/ Deputy Secretaries handling field establishments in the Ministries/ Departments. The dates of the meeting will be announced separately.
The following topics will be discussed at the meeting: But be prepared for the following:
