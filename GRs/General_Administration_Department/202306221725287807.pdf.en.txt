GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: RAMA 2017/ PR No.10/ 6
As per the Commission's Office Secretary, Deputy Secretary, Under Secretary (Law) and Cell Officer (Gazetted) (Entry into Service) Rules, 2018, the posts of Secretary, Deputy Secretary, Under Secretary (Law) and Cell Officer are to be filled on deputation. As per the Maharashtra State Information Commission (Maharashtra State Information Commission) Rules, 2018, the posts of Assistant Section Officer, Legal Assistant, Upper Class Short Writer, Lower Class Short Writer and Clerk-Style Writer (Entry into Service) are to be filled by deputation.
However, due to non-availability of officers/ staff on deputation in these cadre posts, these posts remain vacant for a long time, which is adversely affecting the functioning of the Commission. The Government Circular, Department of Finance, dated 29.6.2017, has issued guidelines to review the sanctioned posts in all the administrative departments and offices under them and fix the revised figure. Accordingly, as a measure to ensure that the posts on the establishment of the Maharashtra State Information Commission do not remain vacant for a long time, the matter of prescribing the revised figure of these posts was under the consideration of the Government.
Government's decision:
A high-level committee of secretaries has been constituted to examine in detail the proposals for creation of new posts, revival of posts and review of posts. In the 4 th meeting held on 16 th September, 2022, while proposing to approve the revised figure as a measure to ensure that the posts in the figure of Maharashtra State Information Commission are not left vacant for a long time, the Committee has approved the revised figure of total 66 regular posts and 80 notional posts for Maharashtra State Information Commission. Accordingly, the revised pattern of posts on the establishment of Maharashtra State Information Commission as shown in Table A and Table B is being approved under this Government Resolution.
