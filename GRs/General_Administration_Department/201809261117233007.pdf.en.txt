The Maharashtra Civil Services (Regulation of Seniority) Rules, 1982. The Maharashtra Civil Services (Regulation of Seniority) (Amendment) Rules, 1988. 23rd September, 1988) vide Government Resolution No.SRV-2018/ VIP67/ P.S.No.207/ 12, No. May 28, 2018
As per Rule 4 (2) (a) of the Maharashtra Civil Services (Regulation of Seniority) Rules, 1982, candidates recommended for appointment to the post of Direct Service should join the post within 30 days from the date of issue of their order of appointment or such further period as the competent authority may, in its discretion, extend. However, since the Maharashtra Civil Services (Regulation of Seniority) Rules, 1982 do not clearly mention the period for which the competent authority may extend the period for acceptance of appointment at its discretion, in order to fill up the vacancies immediately, it was ordered under the Government Order dated May 28, 2018, to grant extension of one month only for joining at its discretion, in exceptional circumstances, after the expiry of the prescribed period of 30 days from the date of issue of the order of appointment. However, it is observed that the employees working in the government service, if they are directly appointed to another post in the government service by applying in the prescribed way, are not being relieved from work even after one month's extension to join the new post of appointment by the concerned department.
The delay is evident as there are several stages in the process of getting approval for the work to be released. In this regard, Reference No. 3 here. The matter of amending the Government Resolution dated 28th May, 2018 was under consideration of the Government.
The government has taken a decision. The Government Decision dated 28th May, 2018 is being amended as follows: 1. The Roll Numbers in the Government Decision (2) are being amended as under:
(2) After the expiry of the prescribed period of 30 days above, in exceptional circumstances, where an extension of time is required to join, the appointing authority may, in accordance with Rule 4 (2) (a) of the Maharashtra Civil Services (Regulation of Seniority) Rules, 1982, allow the concerned candidate to join at his own discretion.
