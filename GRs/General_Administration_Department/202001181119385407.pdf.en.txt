Read:- 1) Government Circular No.Shakaja-1098/ PR No. 75/22, dated 13.09.2001 2) Government Circular, No. SHAKJA-1118/ Q.No. 62/2018/22, Dy. 06.03.2019
Government Circular:- In the premises of the Ministry and the new administrative building building and in the main road, many times the cupboards/ tables/ chairs/ stationery/ old documents are kept. As a result, the roads and surrounding areas look dirty. It also poses a risk of safety hazards and hinders the work of fire prevention measures. Accordingly, instructions have already been issued to all the Ministries/ Departments not to allow any kind of hoarding in the premises of the Ministries/ Buildings and in the thoroughfares.
However, this has not been implemented so far. Also, the Public Works Department has been given full powers to pick up and dispose of waste furniture and other items found in the chhann path without the permission or prior notice of the concerned departments and assuming zero assessment. However, the Public Works Department cannot move the cupboards as the department's documents and documents are kept in the cupboards kept by the departments. For this, the departments should immediately shift the cupboards and other materials kept in the main building of the ministry, the ministry extension building and the new administration building to the place allotted to them or the cupboards should be freed and handed over to the Public Works Department.
All the departments in the Mantralaya Main Building, Mantralaya Extension Building and the New Administration Building should immediately shift the cupboards and other materials kept in the corridor to the place allotted to them or the cupboards should be freed and handed over to the Public Works Department.
No storage shall be allowed in the main building of the Ministry, the extension building of the Ministry and the new administration building.
The Public Works Department should take care that no storage is done in the premises and corridors of Mantralaya Main Building, Mantralaya Extension Building and New Administration Building.
