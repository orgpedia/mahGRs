Preamble- In view of the fact that there is no specific order as to the date on which the condition of minimum service for promotion is to be deemed to be valid, in order to arrive at a parity, the reference No. 2 here. In order to take into account the minimum service in the lower cadre as per the Government decision dated 18th June, 2016, it is advised that the minimum service of the officers/ employees in the cadre should have been completed on 1st September of the year of the selection of the candidate for which the selection is proposed to be made and if such minimum service has not been completed on 1st September, such officers/ employees should not be considered for promotion. Also, the No. 1 here. As per the government circular dated January 8, 2016, instructions have been issued to complete the process of promotion every year as per the prescribed schedule. However, it is observed that the promotion proceedings are not being carried out by the administrative departments as per the promotion schedule. In view of the difficulties arising out of this, the matter was under consideration for amendment of the Government Resolution dated 18th June, 2016.
In pursuance of the Government Decision No. 2 here. The Government's decision of 18 June 2016 is being amended as follows:
The minimum service of officers/ employees in the field of consideration and other necessary qualifications for promotion (confidential report, departmental examination, etc.) should have been completed on the 1st day of the year of the year of the selection for which the minimum service in the lower rank is proposed to be taken into account, i.e., 1st September of the year of the year of the selection or on the date on which the meeting of the Departmental Promotion Committee is held during the course of the year of the year of the selection, and if such minimum service is not completed, such officers/ employees shall not be considered for promotion.
For example, in the year 2016-17 (from 1st September 2016 to 31st August 2017), the date of 1st September 2016 or the date of 1st September 2016 to 31st August 2017 of the year
