Read:- Government Decision, General Administration Department, No. ACAMPA-1217/ Q.No.102/ Ka-8, Dy. 21.09.2017
Preamble: All the provisions of the Compassionate Appointments Policy have been consolidated by a decision of the Government in context. As per the prevailing compassionate appointment policy, in case of death of Group-C and Group-D state government employees while in service, their eligible family members are appointed to the posts in Group-C and Group-D on compassionate grounds.
The main purpose of compassionate appointment is to appoint one eligible member of the family of the deceased employee as a compassionate member in government service in order to help the family overcome the financial disaster that has befallen on the family of the employee in case of his death while in government service.
Considering the above purpose and the background of Covid, it was under the consideration of the government to implement the scheme for the state government employees in Group A and Group B on the same lines as the state government employees in Group C and Group D.
Government Decision: dated 26th August, 2021. Following decisions were taken in the cabinet meeting:
A) The policy of appointment on compassionate grounds is being implemented for Group A and B government employees, like Group C and D government employees. Accordingly, compassionate appointment is being made permissible in Group-C and Group-D to the eligible family members of the employees who died in Group-A and Group-B while in government service.
The benefit of this scheme is being allowed from January 1, 2020 in the wake of Covid.
