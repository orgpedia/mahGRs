Government circular:
The state government is run from the Mantralaya under the Government of Maharashtra and all kinds of state government offices under the Mantralaya. All these offices are considered as representatives of the people of the state. These offices are located across the state. Member of Parliament, Ma. MLAs/ Corporators, public representatives, common citizens, representatives of other private organizations/ establishments, senior officials etc. keep visiting for their work.
The officers/ staff of the Ministry and all State Government offices interact with the visiting stakeholders as representatives of the Government. In such a situation, as a representative of the state government, the attire of all types of officers/ employees in the state government offices is seen as a very important part of their personality. A certain impression of the establishment in which they work is made on the visiting delegates only by the attire of the participants. Therefore, while working in a government office, all the officers and employees of the office are meant to be aware of their overall personality and dress and make sure that their attire is at least compatible with the government office.
However, it has been observed that a large number of officers/ staff working in the office (mainly contractual staff as well as persons engaged in government service as consultants) do not wear the uniform of a government servant while attending office hours. This has tarnished the image of the government employees. A good quality of behaviour and personality is expected from all government officers/ employees by the common citizens. In such a situation, if the dress of the officers and employees is unbecoming, dirty and dirty, then it also has an indirect effect on their overall performance. In view of all these aspects, the following guidelines are being issued regarding the daily dress code of the officers and employees of the Ministry and all the State Government offices (except Government employees in all the cadres for which uniform has been prescribed by various Government Circulars).
(a) The daily dress of all officers and employees should be appropriate to the Government servant.
