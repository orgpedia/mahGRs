The Proposal:
Konkan Bhavan Restaurant is run under the General Administration Department for the convenience of breakfast and lunch for the officers and employees of the government offices in Konkan Bhavan, Belapur-CBD, Navi Mumbai building. At present, gas from LPG cylinders is used to prepare food items in the Konkan Bhawan restaurant. In order to ensure fire safety in the Konkan Bhavan building, the government was considering to connect the gas pipeline (PNG) to supply gas through the pipeline through Mahanagar Gas Limited instead of the LPG cylinder used in the Konkan Bhavan restaurant.
Government's decision:
For the convenience of breakfast and lunch for the officers and employees of the government offices in Konkan Bhavan, Belapur-CBD, Navi Mumbai building, the gas supply through pipeline (PNG) from Mahanagar Gas Limited should be provided to the Konkan Bhavan restaurant run under the General Administration Department. The payment of security deposit and registration fee with Mahanagar Gas Limited for the pipeline gas (PNG) connection to the Konkan Bhawan Restaurant, as well as the pipeline and other ancillary works from the gas meter to the kitchen gas stove of the restaurant to be installed by Mahanagar Gas Limited, are to be done by the registered contractors of Mahanagar Gas Limited. The cost of this work will be approximately as follows.
