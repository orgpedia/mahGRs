If suspended pending, after reviewing his suspension, the competent

In accordance with the proviso to clause (a) of sub-rule (5) of rule 4 of this rule,
The case in which the government employee was suspended due to a criminal case being filed against him
is, in that case, before modifying or revoking the suspension order,
The recommendation of the Suspension Review Committee constituted by the Government for the purpose is relevant.
The authority must receive.
According to the above provisions, the reasons for the suspension of suspended government employees and their
In order to review their cases according to the seriousness, the Government has issued a notification under the above reference No. 1 to 6
Instructions have been issued under the orders here.
Then Ma. Supreme Court Shri Ajay Kumar Chaudhary v. Union of India
Civil Appeal No. In the 1912/2015. Ordered on February 16, 2015 as follows:
They are: -
We, therefore, direct that the currency of a suspension order should
not extend beyond three months if within this period the Memorandum of
Charges/Chargesheet is not served on the delinquent officer/employee; if the
Memorandum of Charges/Chargesheet is served a reasoned order must be passed
for the extension of the suspension. As in the case in hand, the Government is free
to transfer the concerned person to any Department in any of its offices within or
outside the State so as to sever any local or personal contact that he may have and
which he may misuse for obstructing the investigation against him. The Government
may also prohibit him from contacting any person, or handling records and
documents till the stage of his having to prepare his defence. We think this will
adequately safeguard the universally recognised principle of human dignity and the
right to a speedy trial and shall also preserve the interest of the Government in the
prosecution. We recognise that previous Constitution Benches have been reluctant
to quash proceedings on the grounds of delay, and to set time limits to their
duration. However, the imposition of a limit on the period of suspension has not
been discussed in the prior case law, and would not be contrary to the interests of
justice. Furthermore, the direction of Central Vigilance Commission that pending a
criminal investigation departmental proceedings are to be held in abeyance stands
superseded in view of the stand adopted by us. According to the judgment:
a) In the case of suspended government employees within a period of 3 months
Disciplinary proceedings or judicial proceedings have not been initiated.
There is no option but to terminate the suspension in the case.
b) In cases where disciplinary action has been taken within 3 months from the date of suspension.
Suspension continues where proceedings or judicial proceedings have been instituted.
It will be necessary to issue an order with a reason for keeping.

c) In the course of inquiry by the employee whose suspension has ended / is done
