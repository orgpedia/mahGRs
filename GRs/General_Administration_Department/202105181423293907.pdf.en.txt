Introduction: Officers/ employees working in various offices of the government spend 1/3 of their day in the office. If the office environment is clean, beautiful and nutritious, it will definitely benefit the administration and the general public by increasing their efficiency. It also helps in making governance accountable, accessible, clean, transparent and dynamic. In view of these aspects, it is necessary to speed up the administration by changing the internal structure of all the offices of the state government from the state level to the taluka level, to bring about a positive change in the officers/ employees working in the administration.
The issue of implementing the" Beautiful My Office" campaign from the state level to the taluka level was under consideration at the government level so that every office in the state should be clean, beautiful and tidy, and the environment there should be accessible to the citizens and the employees should be workable, motivating, encouraging.
Government Decision: In the background of the above, the government is approving the implementation of the" Beautiful My Office" campaign for all government offices in the state at the taluk, district, division and state level every year from the next financial year.
The Mission will cover the following aspects: (a) Office Sanitation and ancillary matters, (b) Administrative matters (simplification of procedures), (c) Employee Benefits. The scheme will be implemented in three phases from January 1 to March 31, May 1 to July 31 and September 1 to November 30.
