4% reservation has been prescribed for 5 categories of persons with more than one disability.
The Cabinet approved the Maharashtra State Policy for Persons with Disabilities which includes reservation in services for persons with disabilities as per the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016. Accordingly, the government has taken the following steps:
Government's decision:
As per the provisions of the Disabilities Act, 2016, in respect of reservation of posts and services to persons with disabilities to the extent prescribed, 4% reservation is being prescribed for persons with disabilities for admission to Government services as defined in Section 2 (r) of the Act for each of the following five categories of persons with disabilities: 1% for Group A, B, C and 1% for Group D and E. 4% of the vacancies for all the cadres with prescribed disability in the direct service recruitment should be reserved for persons with disabilities.
(a) Blindness or short-sightedness
(b) Hearing or hearing impairment.
Cerebral palsy/ leprosy cured/ dwarfism/ acid attack victims/ muscular dystrophy
(d) Autism/ intellectual disability/ specific learning disability/ mental illness.
e) For persons with more than one type of disability, including deafness and blindness, in the above A to D, in the posts ensured for them
Calculation of posts:- While calculating the posts in Group C and Group D, the number of vacancies in the direct service quota in all the cadres of that group in that recruitment year shall be determined. In doing so, vacancies in the cadre and non-cadre categories of persons with disabilities in the same establishment should be taken into account. However, when the number of posts in the unreserved cadre is large, the cadre having less number of posts and vacancies should be considered for determining the posts of reservation. If a post is to be filled in three different designations in the Group C cadre, one of the posts is not reserved for the disabled.

Government Resolution No: Divyang 2018/ PR No. 114/16 A
4% of the reserved posts should be taken in the other two cadres. For example, if the post of forest guard is not ensured while filling up three posts of clerk, senior clerk and forest guard, if the number of vacancies of the forest guard category is more than the other two cadres, the posts of the remaining two cadres whose number of vacancies is less should be considered for determining the posts of disabled reservation. In doing so, the prescribed reservation amount will be exceeded. If 7 vacancies are available for recruitment, 1 of them should be reserved for the disabled. If more than 7 posts are available for recruitment, the post should be calculated as per the prescribed reservation.
While determining the reservation of posts for persons with prescribed disabilities in the direct service quota of Group' A' and' B', the number of vacancies in the prescribed scale for the respective cadres should be calculated.
Also, the total reservation (in direct service quota posts) in a cadre/ group for the number of categories for which posts have been ensured, irrespective of whether posts have been ensured for all categories of disability or for fewer categories. The total quantum of reservation will not be reduced to ensure posts for the lower category.
Exception to reservation of posts: Provisions regarding exemption in case it is not possible to reserve a post in a department in accordance with the above provision are mentioned in Section 34 of the Disabilities Act. Accordingly, if any government department or establishment or cadre wants to take exemption from the reservation of posts for persons with disabilities for all or some of the cadres on the establishment, considering the nature of the work and responsibilities of the post, such proposal should be issued by the concerned administrative department with full support and recommendations of the Commissioner for Disabilities, in agreement with the Department of Social Justice and Special Assistance. Also, no re-approval will be required for the cadre/ posts which were exempted earlier.
Appointment of Persons with Disabilities to Unreserved Posts:- A person with disability shall not be disqualified for appointment to a post reserved for persons with disabilities, if he is eligible for selection on the basis of merit and the post is not reserved for him. In case the candidates with disabilities are selected for a post without availing the benefit of relaxation given to the candidates with disabilities as per the existing rules, such candidates shall not be counted in the seats reserved for the disabled and the posts/ posts reserved for the disabled shall be filled up from other disabled candidates.
5. Disability Certificate- The person who wants to avail the benefit of disability will have to submit the certificate of the competent authority. Page 3 of 9 during selection process or during appointment

Government Resolution No: Divyang 2018/ PR No. 114/16 A
The appointing authority shall have the power to examine/ revise the certificate.
The Department of Public Health should take action as per the guidelines issued by the Government under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, dated 14.09.2018, for disability screening, assessment and distribution of certificates.
Age Limit:- The maximum age limit fixed under the Government decision dated 16th June 2001 of the General Administration Department for admission to Government services for persons with disabilities is being maintained and it will remain 45 years.
Maintenance of Roster:- Every Government office shall maintain a separate register of 100 points of enrolment for the post of Differently Abled Person Direct Service Recruitment for each cadre on their establishment. Earlier, as per the 3% reservation, points number 1, 34 and 67 in the name list were fixed for persons with disabilities. But now, since there are 4 categories of Divyang, points number 1, 26, 51 and 76 are being fixed to ensure smoothness in maintaining the points list.
The above points should be divided into the following 4 groups.
Group 1 Point No. 1 to 25
Group 2 Point No. 26 to 50
Group 3 Point No. 51 to 75
Group 4 Point No.76 to 100
Point number 1, 26, 51, 76 are being fixed for the disabled and they should be included in the rank of the disabled person in the position ensured for them according to the type of disability, where their point is determined according to their category. If there is only one type of disability guaranteed for a position, start from the point in group 1.
If more than one type of post is confirmed, then (i) Blindness/ Short-sightedness (ii) Deafness or hearing impairment (iii) Cerebral palsy/ Leprosy cured/ Dwarfism/ Acid attack victims/ Muscular Dystrophy (iv) Autism/ Intellectual disability/ Specific learning disability/ Mental illness (v) Any one of the above 1 to 4 with deafness and blindness (v)
Though point number 1,26,51, 76 is reserved for persons with disabilities, if they are not included in the said point, the concerned establishment authorities should take care to show them in the reserved group only. 1 to 25 points in group 1 at a time for some reason

If inclusion is not possible, two points from group 2 should be used appropriately. That is, if for some reason it is not possible to reserve a point in one group, then it must be included in the next group. Once the 100 points are completed, the calculation should start again from the first point. The sample of point nomenclature is given along with" Form A."
Drawing up of posts reserved for the disabled in the next recruitment year and filling up of posts by internal changes:
(1) If a qualified person with disability is not available in a particular recruitment year, the backlog of seats reserved for that type of disability shall be carried forward to the next recruitment year.
The vacancy should not be filled by any other candidate. If in the next recruitment year also a qualified candidate is not available for the post reserved for a particular disabled category, then the post should be recruited by internal change from other disabled category. If the post is filled through internal changes, it should be considered that the post was filled through reservation. If the post cannot be filled up by internal changes, the post should be filled up by other candidates other than the Divyang. In order to avail the above options, it should be clearly mentioned while advertising the recruitment of the post that if suitable candidates are not available while filling the posts of the previous year's backlog, the post will be filled by internal changes and if that is not possible, the post will be filled by other candidates other than the Divyang.
(2) There shall be a reservation in the recruitment of posts in accordance with the prescribed reservation for persons with disabilities in every recruitment year. While doing so, it should be clearly mentioned in the advertisement that the backlog of seats of the previous recruitment year should be filled first and if it is not possible to fill the seats of the current recruitment year, then it will be taken forward.
9. Inclusion of Persons with Disabilities: The reservation for persons with disabilities is a parallel reservation. Parallel reservation is a reservation that separates both social and open areas.
But the posts reserved for persons with disabilities are not shown in the open or social reservation category. The reserved posts for the disabled are shown separately. The candidates who are selected on the basis of merit for the post reserved for the disabled are included in the category to which they belong. For example, if a candidate belongs to a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe, he should be accommodated at the designated point and if a candidate belongs to a Scheduled Tribe, he should be accommodated at the designated point and if a candidate is open, he should be shown at the open point.
But when a candidate belonging to the social reservation category or open category is selected and the point of that category is not vacant, it should be included in the point of vacancy of his category in the future. It should not be included in any other point.
Relaxation in criteria in case of non-availability of eligible PwD candidates:- In case of non-availability of eligible candidates for the reserved seats for PwDs, 5 out of 9 pages in prescribing the candidates belonging to PwD reserved category.

Conditions and terms can be changed. But in doing so, there can be no exemption in the prescribed disability amount. The benefit of the exempted terms and conditions should be given equally to all the candidates belonging to the open and social reservation category.
11. Certificate to be submitted to the Selection Authority at the time of submission of requisition:- The recruitment to the post should be done by strictly implementing the provisions of the Disabilities Act. For this, the competent authority should certify while submitting the requisition in the prescribed format in the" Form B" attached. Further, at the time of first appointment, the appointing authority shall also ensure that the candidate concerned is eligible to avail the benefit of reservation by ensuring that he/ she has a disability within the prescribed percentage for persons with disabilities.
12. Central Government. The Office Order dated 15.01.2018 does not provide for reservation in promotion for Persons with Disabilities. However, the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 empowers the respective State Governments to provide reservation in promotions. The state government has always followed the policy of the central government. In 1998, the central government had given reservation to the disabled for promotion to the post of Group C and D. The State Government has implemented it as per the Government Decision dated 5/03/2002. The said provisions for promotion of disabled employees of Group C and D will continue as before. The decision to prescribe reservation for promotion to Group A and B posts will be taken as per the decision of the Central Government.
These orders will be applicable for appointments in government/ semi-government services, government undertakings, corporations, boards, government-aided institutions and all institutions and services for which the government has the power to issue guidelines.
