Government Resolution No: Computer-2020/ P. No.41/ K.24
Madam Cama Marg, Hutatma Rajguru Chowk,
Mantralaya, Mumbai- 400 032
Date: December 8, 2020
Read:- Government of India, Central Vigilance Commission Circular No. 07/02/08, dated 15/02/2008
Government Decision:- Printers of various companies are working in the General Administration Department (itself). The toner used for this printer was earlier used by refilling/ recycling. Because the toner for the printer is being refilled/ recycled, the quality of the print is not good, and the printers are frequently damaged. Therefore, the opinion of the Department of Information Technology was sought on what action should be taken regarding toner refilling/ recycling.
The Central Vigilance Commission (CVC), Department of Information Technology The guidelines issued on 15/02/2008 have indicated action to be taken as the ink used while refilling/ recycling printer toner is likely to be substandard and the print is of poor quality and thus reduces the life of the printer. Therefore, it is recommended to buy the materials from the vendors who have OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) certification. In view of the above, the government is now allowing the purchase of new toners of printers for the General Administration Department from the OEM certificate holder. The purchase will be made as per the procedure.
