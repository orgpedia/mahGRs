Government Decision: CFR-1217 / Q. No.28 / STAMA (13)
Martyr Rajguru Chowk, Madam Cama Marg,
Mantralaya, Mumbai - 400 032.
Date: 03rd November, 2025.
The Proposal: -
From this year, it has been decided to record the performance appraisal reports of the state government officials online. Mahapar, a computer system developed by NIC, is hosted on NIC's Meghraj cloud. Since Meghraj Cloud's infrastructure is obsolete, the system must be hosted on another cloud immediately. The current cloud infrastructure of the mega-war system is falling short and government officials are finding it difficult to record their performance appraisal reports on the mega-war system. A more capable cloud SHA was required for the system to operate efficiently.
For this. In the meetings of the Project Implementation Committee (PIC) on 29.09.2025, it has been decided to host the disaster system on RailTel cloud. The Project Implementation Committee (PIC) has approved the cost of hosting the Mahaparva system on RailTel cloud and the license cost of the e-office (SPARROW) version. Accordingly, the issue of administrative sanction for the cost of strengthening and smooth functioning of the Mahapar system.
It was under the consideration of the government.
