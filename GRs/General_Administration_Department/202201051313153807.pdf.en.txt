The number of persons infected with Corona virus are increasing day by day. The number of persons infected with Corona virus are increasing day by day. Since the official attendance of the officers/ employees of the ministry and all government offices in the state is being registered on the biometric system, it is imperative to temporarily suspend this system as there is a high risk of disease transmission. As a preventive measure in view of the increase in patients due to the Omicron variant of the Corona virus, instructions are being issued regarding the office attendance biometric system as follows.
The Department of Information Technology should take action within 15 days to install biometric machines on every floor of the Ministry and the new administrative building to avoid crowding and confusion while registering attendance, as the biometric machines installed to check the office attendance of the officers/ staff of the Ministry and the new administrative building are not sufficient.
The use of biometric system for office attendance of officers/ staff in the office of the Ministry and the new administrative building is suspended until further orders, until biometric machines are installed on each floor of the Ministry and the new administrative building by the Department of Information Technology.
(c) In respect of office attendance of officers/ staff in all other government offices in the State, other than the Mantralaya and the new administrative building, necessary action should be taken immediately by the respective office heads to provide adequate biometric machines in the respective offices. At present, the use of biometric attendance system should be suspended till January 31, 2022.
The use of biometric attendance system in Mantralaya, New Administrative Building and all government offices in the state is currently suspended with effect from this order till January 31, 2022. Attendance of officers/ employees in the office during this period should be recorded on the attendance sheet. The administrative departments and the establishment branches of the regional offices should take necessary measures in this regard.
