Circular:
Others for feedback/ decision in all administrative departments of the Ministry.
Informal references are received from the departments. This informal reference/ dharika needs to be discussed with the concerned department/ office several times
to get in touch with the relevant department at that time.
It takes a lot of time to find a phone number. Therefore, it will be easier to contact the concerned office if each office records the operational telephone number of their office on the direction card of the holder. Therefore, all the offices of all the Ministries/ Departments are advised to ensure that the functional telephone number of the office is recorded on the direction letter of each of the holders of their office.
