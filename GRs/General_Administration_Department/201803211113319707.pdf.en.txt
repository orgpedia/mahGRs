Introduction: State government employees are required to perform their duties in a dynamic and efficient manner according to the changing times by constantly raising the standard of their work. If all the government employees take care of this, it will help the state government to become more dynamic and people-oriented. At present, there is no scheme to award outstanding officers/ employees based on objective criteria to motivate and encourage officers and staff to perform their duties more efficiently and dynamically. If the officers/ employees who have done excellent work in the administration are awarded with special awards, it will have an effective effect on all government officers/ employees and they will also be inspired to do their work better. Therefore, the Government was contemplating to implement a new award scheme to honour the officers and staff for their outstanding work by motivating them to discharge their duties efficiently and with full efficiency.
The government has decided to start a new scheme,' Mukhyamantri Sukarmi Puraskar Yojana', to honour outstanding government officials and employees with awards from the financial year 2018-2019.
The scheme will be implemented first at the Ministry level from 2018-2019 and then at the field office level from 2019-2020.
The award is given annually. The Civil Services Day will be observed on April 21. However, considering the short period available for conferment of the award for the first year 2018-2019, the award will not be considered. It will be delivered on August 15, 2018.
The Chief Minister Sukarmi Award Scheme will be implemented as follows:
" Scope of Mukhyamantri Sukarmi Puraskar Yojana": Mukhyamantri Sukarmi Puraskar Yojana will be implemented for all State Government officers/ employees in the State of Maharashtra.
Objective of' Mukhyamantri Sukarmi Puraskar Yojana": The main objective of launching this scheme is to award officers/ employees who have excelled and fully utilized their inherent potentials by evaluating the performance of the government on the basis of ratings/ criteria in a qualitative manner and thereby encouraging other officers/ employees to perform.

3." Brief form of Mukhyamantri Sukarmi Puraskar Yojana": The scheme is being implemented in a graded manner to improve the quality of work of officers/ employees. For this, the criteria for the performance of the state government officers/ employees of all cadres in Maharashtra will be decided accordingly, taking into account the work assigned to them and the expected behavior as per the rules. Based on this criterion, their performance will be reviewed and rated.
This will be done in two ways.
Objective items, for example. The marks will be awarded for performance in office attendance, disposal of work, punctuality, integrity, conduct of office as per confidential report etc.
Performance on subjective items, e.g. Communication skills, drafting skills, level of knowledge of governance rules, impartiality, decision-making ability, presentation ability, innovative working trends, courteous behaviour with people, ability to present the subject matter properly to superiors, etc.
The marks of objective subjects can be determined on the basis of office records. However, the committee is expected to set up a separate committee to evaluate the subjective aspects and determine the score according to the checklist. Further, the Committee is expected to determine the rating based on the opinion of their superiors, juniors and other associates of the same cadre with regard to the criteria given in respect of the concerned officers/ employees.
The scores of the concerned will be finalised for the award at three levels (District, Headquarters and Head of Department) by combining both the scores- Objective and Personality.
Types of Awards under" Mukhyamantri Sukarmi Puraskar" Scheme: Under this scheme, three types of awards will be given as mentioned in the table below. The award for the best administrative department at the ministry level will also be given.
