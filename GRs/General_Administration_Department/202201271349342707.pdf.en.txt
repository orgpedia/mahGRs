Read:- Government Circular, General Administration Department, No.Vichau-1619/ Q.No. 40/11-A, Dy. January 14, 2021.
Preamble: In view of the above, it is proposed to take a conscious decision on the issue of sanction of prosecution under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and authorize at least one Deputy Secretary rank officer to sign the sanction order. Government circulars dated January 14, 2021 have been issued. The officers signing the sanction order have to be present in the court for the evidence in pursuance of the said sanction order. However, during the course of the evidence, it has been observed that in the cross-examination conducted by the counsel for the accused public servant, proper answers are not being given by these officers.
During the evidence, the officer signing the sanction order is asked as to whether or how he is competent to dismiss/ sanction the prosecution of the accused public servant concerned in the case. So, in that case the competent authority has granted sanction to prosecute the original offender with his signature, the competent authority can dismiss the public servant from service and the competent authority has authorised me to sign the sanction order and I am testifying on his behalf. For this, the concerned government prosecutor will also have to conduct an examination/ re-examination as per the requirement. However, since such proceedings are not being conducted, the said sanction order is held invalid by the court and the accused is discharged or discharged without conviction.
Considering the fact that the sanction given to the prosecution is invalid and the accused is acquitted or released without charge if he does not testify properly in court, the government was considering issuing instructions to the officers who signed the sanction order to take precautions in this regard.
The government has issued instructions in this regard:
circular
(a) The officer signing the sanction order shall study the following documents before testifying to the sanction order:
1. Proposal for approval received from the Anti-Corruption Bureau,
(2) all the documents relating to the application;
