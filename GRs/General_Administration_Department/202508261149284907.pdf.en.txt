Circulars at 06.11.2024 are provided below. Accordingly, a preliminary as well as regular hearing is held with the investigating officer after the inquiry authority receives the complete proposal along with all the documents related to the case from the disciplinary authorities. However, erring officers / staff, government witnesses as well as presenting officers in the relevant cases do not attend the scheduled hearings for some time due to illness, disability, workload, etc. In some cases, departmental inquiry of government officers / employees commences after retirement or they retire after inquiry commences. Government witnesses in most cases are also retired. Hence, these erring officers / staff / government witnesses inform the vigilance authority that they are unable to attend the departmental inquiry due to age or medical issues. Their absence leads to a waste of time by the investigating officer, leaving the departmental inquiry incomplete. Reference No. 7 Government Circular, General Administration Department, Govt. Under the 10.06.2025, complete instructions have been given to complete the entire proceedings in the divisional vigilance case within eighteen months, as well as the proceedings in the investigating officer within nine months.
