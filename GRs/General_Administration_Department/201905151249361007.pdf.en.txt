Madam Cama Marg, Hutatma Rajguru Chowk,
Ministry, Mumbai-32.
Date of Birth: May 15, 2019
The Government of Maharashtra Secondary Ministerial Services (Lower Level Clerks) Services Post Admission Training Examination Rules, 1977.
The Government of Maharashtra Secondary Ministerial Services (Subsidiary) Services Post Entry Training Examination Rules, 1977.
The Government of Maharashtra Secondary Ministerial Services (Superintendents) Divisional Examination Rules, 1977.
As per the Government of Maharashtra Secondary Ministerial Services (Lower Level Clerks) Post Entry Training Examination Rules, 1977; and Government of Maharashtra Secondary Ministerial Services (Assistant) Post Entry Training Examination Rules, 1977, the post entry training examination is conducted for the post of Ministerial Clerk-Typist and Assistant Cell Officer respectively. The examination is conducted as per the Maharashtra Government Secondary and Higher Secondary Service (Superintendents) Departmental Examination Rules, 1977.
A candidate must score at least 50 per cent marks in each subject to qualify the exam.
Also, Clerk-Typist Post Entry Training Examination and Assistant Cell Officer Post Entry Training Examination Rules, Rule No. 12 as well as Rule No. According to the rule, if a candidate has scored 55 per cent or more marks in any of the papers, he will be exempted from appearing and passing the examination for that subject in his next attempt. The candidates who have scored less than 50 per cent marks in one or more papers in the qualifying examination are required to re-pass the papers in which they have scored more than 50 per cent marks but less than 55 per cent marks.
Thus, the provision that a candidate must score at least 55 per cent marks to be eligible for exemption from the minimum 50 per cent marks criterion for qualifying the examination is unjustified and the candidates have been requested to reconsider the provision. According to this, the candidate who failed in this exam will not be allowed to appear in any question paper.
