GOVERNMENT DECISION NO. VAHAN- 2119/ PR. NO. 92/31
Ministry, Mumbai- 400 032.
The date is June 10, 2020.
Reference:- 1) Government Resolution No. Parivartan-1015/ S.No. 146/31 dated 07.10.2017.
2) Letter from the Collector, Pune No. PCA/ KAVI- 16-2016, dated 02.07.2016.
Introduction: DV vehicles have been placed under all the District Collector offices for the transportation of state guests/ dignitaries coming to the state. However, if several dignitaries come to visit the place of the district at the same time and the D.V. vehicles are not enough, then an agreement is made to provide vehicles on rent from private vehicle suppliers. As the tender agreement with the Collector, Pune Office was terminated under the previous government decision, the e-tendering process was carried out through the Collector, Pune Office for hiring vehicles. After this e-tendering process, the government was considering approving the minimum rate and the private vehicle suppliers who are ready to supply vehicles at this rate as government approved suppliers.
Government Decision: The Government is approving the lowest rate sheet in the prospectus A received in the e-tendering process for providing vehicles on hire from private vehicle suppliers in the absence of government DV vehicles for the transportation of guests of honor and dignitaries visiting Pune district. Under this decision, the government is also approving the availability of vehicles from the following suppliers at this rate and subject to the terms and conditions of the tender.
