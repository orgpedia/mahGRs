Government Resolution, General Administration Department No: SRV 2018/ PR No.159/ Office No.12, No. 01.08.2019 Government Circular The performance appraisal report of the State Government officers and employees is an important document, based on which basic and important information is available for the further development of the officers/ employees. Writing a performance appraisal report is not only an appraisal process but also a useful tool for planning the competencies and training of officers.
2. The time schedule for writing the performance appraisal report has been fixed.
However, the government has pointed out that the performance appraisal reports are not being written on time. This makes it impossible for the administration to complete the probation period, the permanency certificate, the promotion, the assured progress plan, the review of 50/55 years, etc. on time. As a result, the posts remain vacant, which has an adverse effect on the administrative functioning.
Guidelines for writing performance appraisal reports of all government officers/ employees have been issued under the relevant government decision. The time schedule for submission of the report is as follows:
