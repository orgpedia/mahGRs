Government circular:
As per the Government decision dated 31st August, 1988, the timings of Government offices in and outside Mumbai have been fixed and it has been clarified that lunch break during office hours will be for half an hour. Further, vide Government Circular dated 18th September, 2001, instructions have been issued to the officers/ staff of the Ministry to have a maximum of half an hour between 1.00 pm and 2.00 pm for lunch during office hours.
However, due to non-fixation of lunch time in office hours for officers/ staff of State Government offices other than the Ministry, when people come with complaints/ grievances/ applications in offices having direct contact with the public, often the concerned officers/ staff are not available at their place. When asked about this, visitors are told that it is time for lunch. The time of lunch in different offices is decided according to the convenience of the concerned office. Therefore, complaints have been received that the work of the people is not being done on time. Therefore, it was under the consideration of the government to fix the time of lunch in all government offices during office hours.
However, it is being instructed through this circular that in all the state government offices in the state, there should be a maximum of half an hour between 1.00 pm and 2.00 pm for officers/ staff to have food during office hours. The head of the office should take necessary precautions so that the officers/ employees do not take more time for food, and all the officers/ employees of the same branch do not go for food at the same time.
