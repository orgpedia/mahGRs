In order to ensure that the transfer orders are implemented promptly and effectively, all the Ministries/ Departments shall strictly follow the following instructions:
1) After receiving the transfer orders, all the departments should immediately relieve the transferred employees without waiting for the replacement staff to appear.
2) The transferred employees should be made to join without delay after they are relieved from their respective departments. The establishment officer of the concerned department will be held responsible if there is a case of non-payment of salary and allowances due to non-recruitment of an employee by fixing a mandatory waiting period.
(3) Any employee who directly or indirectly tries to pressurize the employee to modify the transfer order shall be liable for disciplinary action.
Since the transfers are required to be effected effectively, the salary of all the transferred employees as on 31.5.2018 should be deducted by the department in which they are presently working.
