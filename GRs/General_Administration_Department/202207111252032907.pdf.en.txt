For this, a single coordinator/ nodal officer of the rank of Joint Secretary/ Deputy Secretary should be appointed for all the government portals at the department level, so that it will be convenient for the NIC officers/ technicians to take/ give information related to all the portals from a single coordinator/ nodal officer of the department and speed up the work.
