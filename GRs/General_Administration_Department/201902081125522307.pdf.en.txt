Circular to the Government, General Administration Department, No. 2015/ Q. No. 123/18 (Rs. And why dated the 28th September, 2015.
Circular:
Under the Maharashtra Right to Public Service Act, 2015, citizens have to go to different websites to get the public service online as notified by each public authority. Therefore, the portal" Aapka Sarkar" has been developed in such a way that the services offered by all the authorities can be accessed at one place without going to different websites. Therefore, all public authorities are expected to provide their online services only through the portal" Aapka Sarkar." However, in an appeal filed before the State Right to Service Commission, the Commission has observed that some of the government authorities are still taking a stand that the desired service can be availed only after applying on their separate website, which is completely inconsistent with the policy of the government.
(2) All public authorities are, therefore, advised to ensure that while providing online services notified under the said Act, the same are provided through the portal" Apna Sarkar." Also, all the administrative departments of the Ministries should ensure that the instructions are strictly followed by all the public authorities under their control.
