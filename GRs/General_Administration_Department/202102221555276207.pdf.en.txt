Sir,
The Government is making continuous efforts to resolve the issues pending for the last 20 years of the graduate/ diploma holder candidates in the State. Parallel reservation of 10% was provided for direct recruitment to Group C posts outside the purview of Maharashtra Public Service Commission in Government/ Paramilitary Services. Also Reference No. Under Section 2, the age limit for graduate part-time candidates in government service has been increased to 55 years. Reference No. Under 3rd and 4th, guidelines have been issued regarding the procedure and priority of appointment of graduates/ diploma holders in appointments through external agencies.
However, the government is yet to implement the order effectively. Therefore, the question of appointment of graduate/ diploma candidates is not resolved. Accordingly, all the administrative departments shall issue necessary instructions to the Government/ semi-government services, boards/ corporations, municipalities/ municipal corporations, district councils, government-aided institutions and all other authorities, services and institutions under their jurisdiction.
