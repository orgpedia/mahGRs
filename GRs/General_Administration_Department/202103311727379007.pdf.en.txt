General Administration Department, Government Resolution No. 2318/ No. 16/ No. 17, dated 1.3.2018. Disaster 2620/ No.19/ 17, Dy. 22/09/2020.
Introduction:" Departmental Examinations" are conducted by various administrative departments of the government mainly for the following purposes.
1) To hold the office of the President.
2) Checking the eligibility for promotion to a senior position.
For the above-mentioned purposes, the rules of departmental examination are made by various administrative departments of the government for the posts in that department. Thus, there are variations in the" zonal examination" rules of each administrative division, such as the total number of chances to pass the examination, the definition of chances, the age limit for exemption from passing the examination, the minimum required marks to pass the examination, the consequences of not passing the examination, etc. Therefore, there is no uniformity in the rules of departmental examination of government employees and many service related problems are arising. Therefore, it is necessary to bring uniformity in all the departmental examination rules for the government posts for which the departmental examination rules have been made and the examinations are conducted according to them. Keeping this in mind, the government was considering to formulate a common policy for the common subjects in all the departmental examinations for the posts for which the departmental examination rules have been made.
GOVERNMENT DECISION: Through this Government Decision, the policy on common matters regarding all the departmental examinations for the posts for which departmental examinations are conducted by the administrative departments is being decided. This policy will be applicable only to government employees. This policy will not be applicable to employees of Zilla Parishads/ Municipalities/ Municipal Corporations/ Boards/ Corporations/ Authorities/ other semi-government establishments.

3.1 OPPORTUNITY: OPPORTUNITY means the opportunity given to the candidates to appear in the Departmental Examination conducted by the concerned Administrative Department.
Therefore, since the examination conducted by the Administrative Department will be considered as an opportunity, even if the candidate does not submit the examination application or does not appear in the examination despite submitting the examination application, the examination held in that year will be considered as an opportunity given to the candidate concerned.
(3.2) Number of Opportunities- From the date of appointment to the relevant post in the government service (appointment by direct service or promotion), it will be necessary to pass the examination in a total of 3 opportunities.
However, the officers/ employees of the posts to which the probation period is applicable, will be required to pass the said examination within the probation period itself.
(3.3) Calculation of Opportunities- The first time after the date on which the employee joins the government service (as per the order of appointment by direct service or promotion), the process of submitting the application for the departmental examination is started, the conduct of the departmental examination will be considered as the first opportunity for the concerned government employee. The next two exams will be considered as the second and third chance respectively.
Therefore, if the date of submission of the application for the departmental examination in the calendar year has expired before the date on which the government employee will join the relevant post in the government service, then the examination conducted will not be considered as an opportunity as the concerned government employee cannot appear in the examination.
