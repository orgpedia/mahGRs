The Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT), Government of India has released the schedule of in-service training programme for the year 2023-24. A letter dated 25.08.2023 has been sent to the State Government, in which the details of the training institute and duration have been informed.
The schedule of in-service training and the instructions of the Central Government in this regard have been communicated to all the State Government PSUs vide letter dated 21.09.2023.
The nominations of IAS officers are finalised by the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) after the IAS officers report their willingness for in-service training in online mode. Thereafter, letters are sent from them to the concerned authorities and the training institute. After the nomination of the officers for one week in-service training is finalised by the Department of Personnel and Training of the Central Government, it takes some time for the department to receive a copy of their letter in this regard. However, a copy of the letter for finalization of the nomination of the concerned IAS officers is sent to the concerned officers immediately by mutual e-mail/ fax from the Department of Personnel and Training, Government of India. To attend this training, the concerned police officers wait for the receipt of a letter from the General Administration Department regarding permission to attend the training program. However, the Department of General Administration is late in notifying the concerned officers due to delay in receiving the letter of Department of Personnel and Training regarding the finalization of the nomination of officers.
Accordingly, the following instructions are being issued regarding the administrative arrangements to be made for the officers of the Indian Administrative Service to attend the one week in-service training programme offered:
