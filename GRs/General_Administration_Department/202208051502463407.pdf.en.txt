Accordingly, the Central Government has given a relaxation of 2 years in the age limit for recruitment this year. Therefore, considering the increasing number of candidates as well as rising inflation, the reference no. 4 regarding enhancement of permissible grant under Raksha Bandhan and sanction of grant for the Women Land Army Recruitment Mela to be organized by the Defence Forces from this year. 5 has been requested. According to reference no. 7 As per the proposal submitted by Director, Sainik Welfare Department, Pune, the Government has decided to provide enhanced grant for Army recruitment fairs and Army recruitment fairs of Air Force, Navy and Women Army.
