Circular:
In a public interest litigation filed in the Bombay High Court, the Bench of the Government of Maharashtra in Bhalchandra Barwike v. State of Maharashtra at Nagpur, the Court has suggested the adoption of a specific procedure for the admission of candidates in government offices in the state and to bring about uniformity in it. In accordance with these instructions, the Home Department has prescribed the admit card for the entry of visitors to the Ministry. However, the pattern of the admit card has not been prescribed for candidates coming to other government offices in the state. Therefore, the Collectors of all the districts have been asked to prescribe the pattern of the admit card for the visitors coming to the government offices under their control and issue instructions for the entry of the concerned visitor into the government office only after issuing the pattern of the admit card. Also, instructions should be issued to the concerned offices to put up boards at the entry points regarding the time of entry of visitors (senior citizens/ divyang/ general visitors), documents required for obtaining the admit card, prohibited items not to be carried at the time of entry, etc.
2. A copy of the notice board displayed in the Ministry in this regard and the admit card being issued to the visitors are enclosed for reference. However, in this regard, the guidance of the District Superintendent of Police/ Special Inspector General of Police or the concerned Regional Police Officer should be taken.
