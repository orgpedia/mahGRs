As per the directions of the Election Commission of India, it is necessary to construct permanent new godowns for storage of EVMs/ VVPATs, as well as carry out necessary alterations/ repair works in the godowns taken on lease from Maharashtra State Warehousing Corporation. As there is no accounting available with the PWD for construction of these godowns, the PWD has given its opinion to provide funds for construction of godowns for storage of EVMs/ VVPATs by giving administrative approval and financial provision as consumer department by the General Administration Department. Therefore, the matter of opening a new head of account for the provision of expenditure for construction and repair of godowns for storage of EVMs and VVPAT machines was under consideration of the Government.
Government's decision
Approval is being given to open new accounts for the cost of construction and repair of godowns for storage of EVMs and VVPAT machines as under:
