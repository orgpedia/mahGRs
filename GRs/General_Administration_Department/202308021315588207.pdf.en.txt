At the time of retirement of IAS officers, their No Pay/ No Demand Certificate and Group Insurance details are sought from all the offices where they were working during the service of IPS officers to finalize their retirement case. Also, if they are working in the offices of deputation during this period, they have paid their leave salary contribution and pension contribution from these offices to the government or have provided information about how.
The retirement cases of IPS officers are submitted to the Accountant General's office for finalization.
The Government officers/ employees are required to vacate the Government accommodation within 3 months of retirement and rent is charged at regular rate for such stay of 3 months. After the expiry of this period, a penal licence fee is levied for the period till the residence is vacated. It has come to the notice of the Government that some of the IPS officers are not vacating their Government accommodation even after the expiry of the permissible period of stay in the Government accommodation due to retirement or other reasons. If there is any arrears due to the government at the time of retirement, it is recovered from the service stipend as per the rules. However, since the stipend of the retiring IPS officers is paid after retirement, the amount of government contribution arising out of their stay in government accommodation after retirement cannot be recovered from the stipend. Therefore, it was under the consideration of the Government to issue an undertaking to the concerned office of the Public Works Department that the BPSC officers who were residing in the Government Residence at the time of retirement would vacate the Government Residence within a period of 3 months and to issue a No-Objection Certificate by the Public Works Department on the basis of the same.
Government Circular: In view of the above, if the I.P.S. officer is residing in the Government Residence at the time of retirement, he should submit an undertaking to the concerned office of the Public Works Department through the Drawing and Disbursing Officer of the Administrative Department/ Office before retirement that he is vacating the Government Residence within 3 months after retirement. the said Guarantee
