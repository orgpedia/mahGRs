GOVERNMENT DECISION, NO. SANSAKH-2019/ P.S. NO. 54/ OFFICE- 24,
Hutatma Rajguru Chowk, Madam Cama Marg,
Ministry, Mumbai- 400 032.
Date of Birth: November 30, 2019
Preamble: The matter of appointing a supplier for the supply of recycling toner to the General Administration Department (GAD) during the year 2019-20 was under consideration of the Government. Accordingly, following the prevailing procedure, the sealed tariff sheets were called for on 07.11.2019 from the website of the Government of Maharashtra. After considering the tender received in the meeting of the Departmental Procurement Committee held on 22.11.2019, the Government has decided to appoint the supplier after taking into account the rates quoted by the total 4 tenderers who qualified in the technical examination.
Government Decision: As per the recommendation of the Departmental Procurement Committee, out of the 4 eligible bidders, the lowest price was found for the suppliers of Lista& Co., Ballard Estate, Mumbai-38. However, since nine of the toner rates submitted by Lista& Co. were higher than those of the other bidders, it would have been negotiated to be as low as the minimum price of the other bidders. Lista& Co. offered to pay the nine toner rates offered in the tender at the minimum rate offered by the other bidder and submitted the revised tariff to the government. Therefore, taking into account the reduced rates by the suppliers, Lista& Co., Ballard Estate, Mumbai is being appointed as the supplier for supply of Recycled Toner to General Administration Department (itself) for the period 2019-2020 at the rates mentioned in the following statement for the period from 01.12.2019 to 30.11.2020.
