Maharashtra Civil Services (Salaries) Rules, 1981 (2) Government Resolution, Finance Department, No. 27th December, 2011), Department of Finance, No. 1311/ S.No.17/ Service-3, Dy. 1st June, 2015
Government circular:
As per Rule 56 of the Maharashtra Civil Services (Pay) Rules, 1981, when a government servant is assigned additional charge of another post in addition to his own post, he is sanctioned additional pay/ special pay for such other post. The powers to grant additional pay/ special pay have been delegated under Roll No. 14 of Annexure 1 of the Maharashtra Civil Services (Pay) Rules, 1981. Accordingly, Department of Finance has issued instructions from time to time regarding the authority to grant additional charge under various Government decisions and the rates of additional pay/ special pay. As per the instructions of the Finance Department, proposals for additional charge beyond two years are submitted to the General Administration Department for approval. However, there is no policy/ governance mandate of the General Administration Department as to who should be given additional charge. As a result, many times the right service and experienced people are given additional charge and the administration does not get the expected benefit.
In view of the above situation, the following guidelines are being issued as to who should be given additional charge: 1) As per Rule 56 of the Maharashtra Civil Services (Pay) Rules, 1981, Government servants are assigned additional charge of a post other than their own. The additional charge of such other vacant post should be assigned to the most senior, experienced and efficient officer/ staff of the same cadre in the same office, preferably under the same administrative department, keeping in view the administrative convenience and urgency. In the case where such officers/ staff are not available, the lower cadre attached to the post concerned

The senior-most officer/ staff should be given additional charge. If due to some reasons the senior most officer/ employee is to be given additional charge to the latter, the written reasons why the senior most person is ineligible for the additional charge should be mentioned in the affidavit.
(2) The concerned shall ensure that the officer/ employee assigned the additional charge is able to discharge the duties and responsibilities of the post assigned to him along with the duties and responsibilities of his original post.
(3) In view of the administrative convenience and urgency, the Administrative Department may consider the services of senior and experienced officers/ employees of the same cadre in other offices under its control in case of non-availability of officers/ staff in the same office as per the above (1) for giving additional charge of the vacant post in the office under the Administrative Department. Also, where there is only one office in a district, additional charge may be considered for officers/ employees of the office of the adjoining district. However, in doing so, the concerned shall ensure that the officer/ employee given additional charge is able to discharge the duties and responsibilities of the post along with the duties and responsibilities of his original post.
(4) If the officer/ staff against whom departmental inquiry is being conducted is likely to influence his own departmental inquiry or obstruct the departmental inquiry, such officer/ staff should not be given additional charge.
5) The concerned administrative department should take immediate action to fill the vacant post given additional charge.
The Administrative Departments shall take action as per the Government Order issued by the Finance Department from time to time regarding the payment of additional pay/ special pay as per Rule 56 of the Maharashtra Civil Services (Pay) Rules, 1981.
(3) All administrative departments shall ensure that the provisions of this Government Circular are implemented.
(4) The instructions issued under this Government Circular shall, as soon as may be, be incorporated in the M.N.S. (Salaries) Rules, 1981, to be dealt with separately by the Finance Department.
