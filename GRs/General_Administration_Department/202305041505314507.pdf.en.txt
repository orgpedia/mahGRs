Hutatma Rajguru Chowk, Madam Kam Marg,
Mantralaya, Mumbai 400 032
Date: 4th of May, 2023.
The Proposal:
The Maharashtra Public Service Commission (MPSC) was set up under Article 315 of the Constitution of India for the purpose of transparent and fair selection of eligible persons in the government service.
The Maharashtra Public Service Commission functions as per the provisions prescribed in Article 320 of the Constitution.
The Maharashtra Public Service Commission has to take the help of subject experts from various subjects working on the establishments of agricultural universities, non-agricultural universities, public universities, technical universities, autonomous universities, government educational institutions, government-aided educational institutions, government-recognized unaided educational institutions and autonomous educational institutions in Maharashtra to carry out the work entrusted to the Maharashtra Public Service Commission in a hassle-free and time-bound manner.
For confidential and sensitive work of the Maharashtra Public Service Commission, the services of experts in the relevant subject in the above educational institutions are made available to each other through the Commission in direct contact with the concerned experts as per the requirement of the Commission. For this work, the experts are also paid honorarium at the prescribed rate by the Commission in addition to the daily and travel allowance at the government rate.
However, it has been observed that at times, the services of subject experts from some educational institutions are not being provided for the confidential and sensitive work of the Commission. This will affect the exam schedule. As a result, the required candidates for government service are not available on time. As a result, lack of adequate manpower is affecting the speed of government work. Considering all these aspects, the following instructions are being given to make the services of subject experts in various educational institutions available to the Maharashtra Public Service Commission.
Government Circular: The recruitment process conducted by the Maharashtra Public Service Commission is carried out to select suitable candidates for the posts in the state government service in a transparent and fair manner. The heads of educational institutions and subject experts from agricultural universities, non-agricultural universities, public universities, technical universities, autonomous universities, government educational institutions, government-aided educational institutions, government-recognized unaided educational institutions and autonomous educational institutions in the state should provide necessary support to the Maharashtra Public Service Commission so that the commission can effectively carry out its work in the prescribed time frame.

Such coordinators will be responsible for providing necessary support in making the services of subject experts available to the Commission as per the requirements of the functioning of the Maharashtra Public Service Commission.
All of the above recommendations should be strictly implemented.
