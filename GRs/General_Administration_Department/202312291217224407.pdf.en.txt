The instructions for writing his designation No. Circulars 1 to 3 are given here. However, it has come to the notice of the government that some officers are not writing their names and designations under their signatures.
2. Also, under reference No. 4 The circular here gives instructions on how to do the marking on the comment. It has come to the notice of the government that despite these instructions, some officers/ employees are still not marking properly while writing comments.
(3) Therefore, all the Ministries/ Departments are again informed that every letter issued from the office shall bear the name of the officer signing in brackets under the signature and his designation thereunder.
The instructions to be written should be followed exactly, and so should your subordinate offices, and at the time of writing the comments should be sent to the reference no. 4 Care should be taken to mark as explained in the circular here. This will make it easier to trace the signatory/ approver of such letters in case of any problem in writing of such letters or comments in future.
