Government Decision No. Sapruvi - 12023/62/2024 - Sapruvi / Information (Room-6) Madam Cama Marg, Martyrdom Rajguru Chowk,
Mantralaya, Mumbai - 400 032
Date: February 4, 2026
Reference: - Government Circular No. Sankarno 2016 / Pt. Crr 04/16 six dates. 23.11.2016
The Proposal: -
The above-mentioned circulars direct all government, semi-government offices and local bodies to keep forms for feedback of visitors to the administrative office.
Also, many offices have pre-existing information boxes and complaint boxes.
However, the nature of this arrangement is limited to complaints. This system is not of any use in terms of administrative reforms, revising and revising the functioning of the office. The prime objective of the government is to create a people-oriented, transparent, accountable and efficient administration. A number of services are provided to the citizens through various departments of the government and government offices. The experience of citizens in dealing with the process, the support they receive, the office environment, the behaviour of officers and staff, ease of doing business, or delays is very important for the administration.
An examination of the functioning of the government, based on the experiences of its citizens, will give the administration an opportunity to introspect and clearly identify areas that need improvement. This will increase the speed, ease and quality of government functioning. Also, it will help the administration become more transparent and accountable by preventing in-person, biased, or illegal practices. Trust between the government and the citizenry will become more FS if the expectations and aspirations of the citizens are reflected in the governance process.
Reviews of Right to Information, Right to Services and government schemes have shown that many schemes demand unnecessary documents and information. Therefore, it was under the consideration of the Government that the concerned departments should study the suggestions given by the citizens as well as the officers and staff of the implementing agencies regarding their plans and implement the citizen feedback mechanism to meet the objectives of administrative innovation, excellence and good governance.

The Government's Decisions:
All government offices in the state should provide feedback formats in the prescribed format attached to the citizens in every government office, in line with the concept of administrative innovation, excellence and good governance, with a streamlined mechanism to obtain feedback from the citizens based on their first-hand experience. This feedback format should be available near the feedback box. Also, there should be no formatting obligation if someone wants to write some feedback on paper themselves. A locked feedback box should be kept at the front of the office for citizens visiting the government office to submit this feedback.
2. In the above feedback formats, citizens can submit scores ranging from 1 to 5 on issues such as office hygiene, service delivery, citizen engagement, ease of doing business, and can freely enter their feedback on the experiences they have had and submit the feedback in a locked box.
3. Visitors to the office as well as the officers and staff of the establishment of the office can give their feedback on how the government can become more people-oriented and what changes are required in the government schemes from a developmental and administrative point of view.
4. The above feedback box should be opened on the 5th of every month or on the next official date in the presence of the Head of the Office or the officer authorised by him, if that date is a Government holiday. If possible, the proceedings should be conducted in a transparent manner with the testimony of the office staff as well as the citizens present. All the suggestions received from the feedback box should be collected by reading the feedback and analyzed according to their format and content.
5. All feedback received from the feedback box should be recorded in the feedback register in the form of citizen's name (if any), date and subject. Feedback received should be categorized into two groups, Feedback on Policy / Rules that can be implemented at the office level.
6. The office heads concerned should immediately implement useful and viable suggestions that can be implemented immediately at the office level. The feedback received will be used to improve office hygiene, service delivery, citizen engagement, ease of doing business, etc., and to implement new concepts under the Rajiv Gandhi Governance Mobility Mission.
should be done.
7. Feedback received from citizens on changes or simplifications in rules, procedures or policies that may seem appropriate but require policy or senior level approval for implementation, shall be forwarded by the Head of the concerned office to his / her superior office and a copy thereof shall be forwarded to the Secretary and Secretary (Administrative Innovation, Excellence and Good Governance) of the department concerned. Necessary decisions can be taken after considering such proposals at the government level.

8. The aforesaid procedure will create a mechanism for continuous feedback and implementation. Such feedback at the secretary level can also compile the necessary information about the functioning of government offices, public relations, and the usefulness of schemes, for changes to be made under Government Process Re-engineering and for improvements and assessments to be made under the District Good Governance Index.
It will also be useful in policy decision making. The ASHA feedback received every month with the help of officers and advisors working at the secretary level is expected to be used continuously for administrative innovation and improvement.
