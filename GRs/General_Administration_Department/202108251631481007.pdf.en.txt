Preamble: In order to help the family overcome the financial disaster that would befall the family of an employee in case of his death while in government service, one eligible member of the family of the deceased employee concerned is appointed on compassionate grounds as a Compassionate Member in government service.
Considering the said purpose of compassionate appointment, it is intended to give immediate appointment on compassionate grounds. However, it has been observed that after applying for appointment on compassionate grounds, it takes a few years to get the appointment. The number of candidates waiting for the recruitment is increasing day by day. The objective of the scheme will be achieved if employment is provided immediately as per the compassionate appointment policy in the wake of COVID-19. Keeping this in mind, the government was considering to publish a Standard Operating Procedure for compassionate appointment to remove confusion regarding the procedure of compassionate appointment and to help complete the process of compassionate appointment faster.
Government circular:
The Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for compassionate appointments is being published through this Government Circular to provide immediate appointments to the candidates in the waiting list for appointment on compassionate grounds.
In 1994, all the previous orders on the Compassionate Policy were superseded. The new compassionate policy was introduced by the Government Resolution of 26 October 1994. However, by consolidating the standard procedure of compassionate appointment through Government Orders issued from time to time in respect of compassionate appointments since 1994 till date, the procedure is summarily cited as follows for easy reference.
(a) The procedure for appointment:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| 1   | Action to be taken on compassionate appointments at the level of appointing authorities under each administrative division |
| (1) | Preparation of separate waiting list for group wise compassionate appointment by the appointing authority.                 |
