Read- General Administration Department, Government Resolution No: SRV-2018/ PR No. 159/ Office No. 12D As of August 1, 2019: The Governor gave his. In a letter dated November 26, 2021, the General Administration Department has been informed that since the delay in giving promotions is due to the delay in administrative procedures, action should be taken to create awareness among the heads of all administrative departments to dispose of the promotion proposals expeditiously.
As per the above instructions of the Hon'ble Governor, it was under consideration of the Government to issue instructions to all the administrative departments for expeditious disposal of the promotion proposals.
Government Circular: With a view to create awareness for speedy disposal of promotion proposals, the General Administration Department, under the supervision of Dy. The following are the important points of the guidelines issued regarding the promotion process under the Government Decision of 1st August 2019.
(1) Adherence to the prescribed time schedule- In order to expedite the disposal of the proposal for promotion, the administrative departments should ensure that the proposal for promotion is completed within the prescribed time as per the schedule mentioned in Annexure III of the relevant Government Decision, so that the officer/ employee, despite being eligible for promotion, does not have to retire and be deprived of promotion before that time due to non-processing of promotion within the prescribed time.
(2) Divisional Promotion Committee meeting to be held in September every year It has been observed that the meeting of the Divisional Promotion Committee is not being held every year by the Administrative Department at the prescribed time. As a result, the entire process of promotion gets delayed. Therefore, all the administrative departments should take care of holding the meeting of the Divisional Promotion Committee in the month of September every year. Accordingly, the meeting of the Departmental Promotion Committee for the current selection year will be held in September

Not held in 2021, they should immediately hold a meeting of the Divisional Promotion Committee and complete the further proceedings of promotion without delay.
Completion of Confidential Reports- The main reason for the delay in the proposal of promotion is the non-availability of confidential reports for the last 5 consecutive years. Therefore, in order to address this issue, the suggestions in Annexure 4 of the said Government Resolution are being re-cited as under:
i.If confidential reports are not available for any of the last 5 consecutive years, the reasons therefor need to be taken into account. However, the reasons for non-availability of confidential reports by the administrative department are not examined, but the confidential reports of the previous period are taken into account. This procedure is incorrect. For the reasons set out in clauses 7 (c) (3) and 8 (8.3), the confidential reports for the previous period shall be taken into account. Confidential reports for that previous period for any other reason should not be taken into account.
Point No. 4 of Annex. 8.1 If an officer/ employee has submitted his/ her performance appraisal report to the officer and the report is not available as the report/ review has not been done, the officer/ employee is not responsible for the same and his/ her performance appraisal report for that year should be considered by the committee for promotion, assuming that he/ she meets the minimum criteria for promotion.
(iii) Section 4 of the Act. 8.1 If the concerned officer/ employee has not written his/ her own self-assessment report, then his/ her performance appraisal report without his/ her self-assessment should be written by the Reporting and Reviewing Officer and that score should be considered for promotion.
(iv) Therefore, without keeping the matter open in the absence of a confidential report, by proceeding as above, the concerned should be declared qualified or disqualified on the basis of the confidential report.
(4) Publication of updated Service Merit List every year- Since the Service Merit List is not updated, it is not possible to submit the list of officers/ employees in the field of consideration to the Committee for verification of eligibility. Therefore, the meeting of the departmental promotion committee is delayed. Keeping this in view, all the administrative departments should ensure that the service excellence lists of all the cadres under their command are updated and published every year.

(5) Ensure timely issuance of orders for service matters in connection with promotions- orders for satisfactory completion of probation period of officers/ employees, orders for permanency certificate, orders for review of 50-55 years, etc.
So that there is no delay in the process of promotion in the absence of this order when the officer/ employee is in the field of promotion.
(6) Examining the proposal in accordance with the reservation- The administrative departments should take care to submit the proposal to the committee with self-explanatory feedback after strictly examining whether the officers/ employees in the field of consideration are eligible for promotion as per the orders issued from time to time regarding the reservation in promotion.
(7) Fulfillment of all the criteria for promotion- It is not checked thoroughly whether all the officers/ employees of the field of consideration meet all the criteria for promotion at the time of the meeting of the Departmental Promotion Committee. However, in order to ensure that there are no errors in the offer of promotion, all the criteria required for promotion [in the Government decision in question, point no. A (3)] is fulfilled or how this matter is required to be examined by the Divisional Promotion Committee.
(8) Submission of complete proposal to the General Administration Department- Many administrative departments do not submit to the General Administration Department along with the proposal of promotion all the criteria of the officer/ employee in question meeting all the criteria or how the officer/ employee is being considered for promotion according to the latest service rank order or how he has taken the benefit of reservation or how the sanctioned number of posts and the rate of promotion is correct as per the service entry rules. In the absence of this information, the General Administration Department has to be informed about the return of the proposal with the necessary information accordingly. Hence, there is a delay in giving the consent of the General Administration Department to the proposal of the concerned promotion. However, in order to avoid such delays, the administrative departments should take care to submit the complete proposal of promotion to the General Administration Department as per the guidelines mentioned in the relevant government decision.
(9) Promotional Orders Issued Without Delay After the proposal for promotion is approved by the General Administration Department, the administrative departments are seen to be issuing direct promotion and posting orders with considerable delay.
After approval of the General Administration Department to the proposal of promotion to remove this administrative delay, the promotion and posting will be done immediately after obtaining the approval of the concerned appointing authority as per the prescribed procedure.
