Parallel reservation is a reserved reservation and it has to be calculated on the posts available in the prescribed percentage of reservation in the social and open (non-category) category. The open (non-local) posts of the components of the parallel reservation, except the reservation of disabled and ex-servicemen, should be filled in accordance with the Government Sanction Letter dated 19.12.2018 and the posts of social reservation as per the provisions of the Government Circular dated 16.3.1999. Though the reservation for the disabled is a parallel reservation, the reservation is carried forward to the next recruitment year as per the provisions of the Disabilities Act. Also, the reservation for ex-servicemen needs to be carried forward as per the provisions of Circular dated 16.4.1981. In case eligible ex-servicemen are not available, proposals for recruitment from other eligible candidates along with the selection list are expected to be sent to the concurrence of this Department. Copies of the decision have been sent to the government. Be sure to follow the provisions.
