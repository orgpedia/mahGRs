Reference:- 1. Government Resolution, General Administration Department, No. ACMPA-1217/ Q. No. 102/ Q. 8, D. 21.09.2017 2. Government Resolution, General Administration Department, No. 06.01.2021 3.

The Proposal:
In order to help the family overcome the financial disaster that would befall the family of the employee in case of his death while in government service, one eligible member of the family of the deceased employee is appointed on compassionate grounds as a Compassionate Member in government service. While making appointments under the Compassionate Appointments Policy, the need for amendment in the following aspects was felt.
(a) In case of death of a Government servant under the Compassionate Scheme, within one year, one of the eligible members of the family has to apply for compassionate appointment according to the qualification held by him. As the qualification for Group-C is a degree and the compassionate does not hold the qualification of Group-C at the time of admission on the waiting list, they have to apply for the Group-D post only. In fact, till the time a job is obtained from the waiting list of Group-D, some of the beneficiaries hold the qualification of Group-C, but since there is no provision in the existing policy to take the name of the beneficiary on the waiting list of Group-D in the waiting list of Group-C, the beneficiary cannot be included in the waiting list of Group-C. Therefore, it has been observed that provision needs to be made for inclusion of name in Group-C waiting list from Group-D.
(b) The prevailing compassionate appointment policy stipulates that a typewriter certificate should be submitted within a prescribed period of two years after compassionate appointment for the post of clerk-typist.
However, there are some other cadres other than Clerk-Typist cadre in Group-C which require typing qualification as per the service entry rules. in such categories of posts.

Applying the provision of submitting the typewriter certificate within two years after the compassionate appointment and other provisions like the clerk-typewriter appointed on compassionate grounds are also applicable to these cadres or how is it being asked by the appointing authorities. Hence, there should be a policy on this.
e) There is no clear provision in the prevailing compassionate policy as to whether or how the family of such missing government servant should be provided with a compassionate appointment scheme in case of his disappearance. Therefore, there is confusion among the appointing authorities as to whether or how to apply compassionate appointment to such missing employees. Hence, there is a need to have a clear policy on this.
Government's decision:
In view of the above background, the following provisions are being made in the Compassionate Policy through this Government Decision.
Transfer of name from Group-D waiting list to Group-C waiting list:- If the candidate on the waiting list of Group-D has obtained the requisite additional educational qualification for the post of Group-C before being appointed on compassionate grounds to the post of Group-D and accordingly applies for inclusion of name in the waiting list of Group-C, his name shall be excluded from the waiting list of Group-D and included in the waiting list of Group-C. For this purpose, the candidate in the waiting list of Group-D shall include his name in the waiting list of Group-C on the date on which he makes a complete application to the appointing authority along with proof of possessing the educational qualification for Group-C and his name shall be excluded from the waiting list of Group-D.
Accordingly, the office of the appointing authority shall inform the concerned District Collector's office about the exclusion of the name of the candidate from the common waiting list of Group-D at the district level and the inclusion of the date of application made by the candidate in the common waiting list of Group-C to the appointing authority for changing the group after obtaining the educational qualification of the post of Group-C. The District Collector should take action on it.
Once a name is removed from the waitlist of group D and added to the waitlist of group C, the name cannot be added to the waitlist of group D again.
Even if the beneficiary has requested to change the group in the past, as there is no such provision in the then rules, the beneficiary should again apply to the appointing authority to change the group. The name of the beneficiary may be changed from the waiting list on the date of receipt of such application or on the date of receipt of such application.
