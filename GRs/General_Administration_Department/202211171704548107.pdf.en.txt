The performance appraisal report of the state government officers and employees is an important document, based on which basic and important information is available for the further development of the officers/ employees. Writing a performance appraisal report is not only an appraisal process but also a useful tool for planning the competencies and training of officers.
Guidelines for writing performance appraisal reports of all government officers/ employees have been issued under the relevant government decision. Also, the schedule for writing the performance appraisal report has been fixed. However, the government has pointed out that the performance appraisal reports are not being written on time. This makes it impossible for the administration to complete the probation period, the permanency certificate, the promotion, the assured progress plan, the review of 50/55 years, etc. on time. As a result, the posts remain vacant, which has an adverse effect on the administrative functioning.
The period of assessment is from 1st April to 31st March of the entire reporting year. Accordingly, the process of writing the performance appraisal report of all government officers/ employees must be completed by 31st December of the following year. Self-assessment, reporting, review and revision are individual as well as collective responsibilities of every officer/ employee and must be carried out with utmost diligence.
Accordingly, all the Establishment Officers/ Editing Officers are being instructed to complete the process of writing the Evaluation Report within the stipulated time as follows: 1) The entire process of writing the Evaluation Report for the year 2021-22 should be completed by 31.12.2022.
Confidential reports for the year 2021-22 in respect of officers involved in the Mahapara will be closed in the Mahapara system on 31st December, 2022.
