Read: Government Decision, General Administration Department, No. Akampa-1219/ No. 56/ VIII, D. 10.06.2019
Preamble: In the case of direct recruitment to the posts which are not restricted by the Finance Department, 10% of the posts falling vacant every year should be filled by compassionate appointment and in the case of direct recruitment to the posts which are restricted by the Finance Department, 20% of the posts approved to be filled every year should be filled by compassionate appointment.
However, considering the small proportion of compassionate appointments, long pending backlog, increasing number of waiting lists and the frequent demand from the holders of compassionate appointments and public representatives etc. for immediate receipt of compassionate appointments, it was under consideration of the Government to relax the limit for the time being.
Government Decision: Relaxing the limit of 10% and 20% for recruitment of compassionate appointment in the Government Decision under reference, in respect of all the posts in the direct service quota in the Finance Department for which there are restrictions on recruitment and for which there are no restrictions on recruitment, 20% of the posts falling vacant annually in Group-C and Group-D should be filled by compassionate appointment.
The 20% cap will be applicable for three years (January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2021) from the calendar year 2019. Thereafter, action should be taken for grant of compassionate appointment from the calendar year 2022 (from 1st January, 2022) as per the decision of the Government in question.
Henceforth, considering the limit for appointment by way of compassionate appointment, while determining the number of posts for grant of compassionate appointment, if the number of posts is less than 0.5, at least one post should be filled by compassionate appointment.
For easy reference regarding fixation of number of posts for compassionate appointment, see the Annexure.
