Subject: Guidelines on direct recruitment and feedback on the draft government decision on the schedule...
Sir, in order to provide direct recruitment to the candidates, since there is no uniformity in the time frame of the appointment process by different government agencies, the matter of issuing comprehensive guidelines by combining the instructions of the government order regarding the appointment and setting a new schedule of steps in the direct recruitment process is under the consideration of the government.
The draft of the proposed government decision in this regard has been attached with the draft. In view of the difficulties in implementing the process of direct recruitment to the field office under you, you are requested to submit your self-explanatory comments/ suggestions in accordance with the draft Government Order to the Deputy Secretary (Services) in the following format directly by letter or e-mail at geeta. kulkarni@nic. in within one month from the date of issue. Please note that any suggestions will not be considered.
