The Office of the Chief Electoral Officer (Secretary/ Executive Officer-33) conducts elections to the Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha, Maharashtra Legislative Assembly and Legislative Council in the election related business. Apart from the general elections to the Lok Sabha and the state legislative assemblies, the schedule for the by-elections to the two Houses, biennial/ bye-elections to the Council of States and the Legislative Councils are announced by the Election Commission of India on a regular basis and the election process is carried out throughout the year. As per the directions of the Election Commission of India, the voter registration drive is started in the state every year on the basis of the qualifying date of January 1. These include the Commission's suggestions on campaigns for voter awareness through events such as National Voters" Day, Women's Day etc.
The exercise is being planned in the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The 2019 general elections are underway and the office of the Chief Electoral Officer has started the pre-election work to conduct electoral rolls, voter awareness and physical elections in the state. The Election Commission of India (ECI) has launched the Systematic Voters Education and Electoral Participation (SVEEP) programme. As per the directions of the Supreme Court, VVPATs will be used along with EVMs in all polling stations for the Lok Sabha elections. Since electioneering is very sensitive, important and time-bound, more manpower is required for this work. Therefore, the matter of creating more number of posts for election work on the establishment of the General Administration Department was under the consideration of the government.
