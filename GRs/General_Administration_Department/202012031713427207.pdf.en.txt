Government Resolution No.Shakaja-1119/ PR No. 123/2019/22,
Ministry, Mumbai- 400 032.
Date: December 3, 2020
Introduction: All the administrative departments of the state government were earlier functioning in the Mantralaya and the new administrative building.
The ministry building was renovated after a fire in June 2012. After the renovation of the building. The allocation has been made to the Chief Minister/ Deputy Chief Minister/ Minister/ Minister of State as well as to the Chief Secretary, Additional Chief Secretary, Principal Secretary, Secretary and administrative departments of the Ministry. Four departments- rural development, public health, medical education and water supply- are still functioning out of the ministry building due to lack of adequate space. As these departments are important for issues related to the rural areas, the Ministerial level of these departments is very important. Meetings are held with the Chief Minister/ Deputy Chief Minister/ Minister/ Minister of State/ Chief Secretary. Since the heads of departments and other officials of these departments have to come to the ministry frequently for these meetings, a lot of their time is spent in commuting. Also, if you have to stay after a meeting in the ministry for other important work or for another meeting, then you have to spend time elsewhere due to the unavailability of waiting rooms. Also, in the recent times, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the workload in the public health and medical education departments has increased and the concerned departments have to take urgent decisions at the senior level. Therefore, it is necessary to bring these departments back to the ministry for the convenience of administrative work. In this regard, frequent follow-ups are being made to provide office space in the Ministry building by the concerned departments. These departments are required to be provided space in the Ministry or in the new administrative building for the convenience of administrative work. Also, 2 Ministers of State in the present Cabinet are to be provided space in the Mantralaya building. At present, there is no vacancy in the Mantralaya building or the new administrative building. However, in the new administrative building, space has been made available for several statutory boards. It was under consideration of the Government to shift these Statutory Boards and provide space in the new Administrative Building building for 3 Departments of Public Health, Water Supply and Medical Education functioning in the G.T. Hospital building and for the 2 Ministers of State. The government has taken the following decisions:
Government Decision: The 3 Departments of Public Health, Water Supply and Medical Education functioning outside the Mantralaya building i. e., in the building in the premises of Gokuldas Tejpal Hospital are being provided space in the new Administrative Building building.
