Government Circular No: Vashiya-1324 / Q.No.30 / Vicho-1
Mantralaya, Mumbai 400 032
Dated March 12, 2025
Government Circular: -
Under sub-rule (2) of rule 8 of the MNAS (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1979, it is prescribed that when the disciplinary authority is of the opinion that there is sufficient ground to ascertain the truthfulness of any allegation of misconduct or misconduct made against a government servant, that authority may suo motu verify the truthfulness of the allegation or appoint an authority to do so.
Disciplinary officers do not have enough time to perform their own office duties and conduct their own departmental inquiries. Complete information about the rules and instructions of the government is required to complete the departmental inquiry by following strict rules.
Also, since it is preferable for independent officers to conduct inquiries under Rule 8 of the Maharashtra Civil Services (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1979, for severe punishment, the disciplinary officer appoints and conducts inquiries on their own, without having to do so himself.
2. The vigilance officer should carry out the entire process of vigilance strictly in accordance with the provisions of the rules. The disciplinary authority is responsible for proving the charge. The vigilance officer must carefully evaluate the written and oral evidence presented to him and make a reasonable inference and record the findings of each of the charges with reasons as to whether or how the charges are proved.
3. The vigilance officer is required to know the seriousness of the vigilance process and his role in it and perform the different SOAR duties and responsibilities consciously during the investigation proceedings. However, at times, if the vigilance officer does not thoroughly understand the procedure prescribed under the provisions of the rules and does not proceed with the inquiry in a strict manner accordingly, the inquiry may result in a fault in the investigation leading to cancellation by the erring vigilance disciplinary authority or the inquiry and the final orders based on it may be set aside in appeal or by the court.
4. Since the investigation is quasi-judicial in nature, the vigilance officers are required to perform their duties with due diligence keeping in view the seriousness of the investigation process.
