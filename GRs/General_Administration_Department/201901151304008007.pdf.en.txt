The Ministry of Food. Office of the Prime Minister, The Minister, Ma. Offices of the Minister of State. The Chief Secretary, Secretary level officers and Joint Secretary level officers of all the Ministries and Administrative Departments, Speaker, Speaker, Deputy Speaker, Deputy Speaker, Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Secretariat, Chairmen of Committees and Joint Secretary level officers of the Legislative Secretariat are being provided food and beverages through credit sales through the Vidhan Bhawan Restaurant.
2. It is observed that these credit sales amounts are sometimes credited to the accounts of Drawing and Disbursing Officers of the Ministry Restaurants Office through NEFT/ ECS from the respective departments/ offices. On verification of the bank's monthly statement and the restaurant's cash register, it is not possible to match the amount deposited by which department in the bank account and thus there is a discrepancy between the statement of the bank account and the cash register. In this regard, the Accountant General's Office has raised strong objections during the audit of accounts.
In view of the above, it is advised to the offices of all the departments of the Ministry and the Legislature Secretariat that the amount of payment of food items supplied through credit sale should be reported to the Restaurant Office along with the statement of the amount paid after depositing the same in the accounts of the Drawing and Disbursing Officer of the Restaurant Office through NEFT/ ECS, so that it will be easy for the Department to record the amount paid in the Restaurant Office register.
4. The possibility of adverse impact on catering services provided by the restaurant to its department cannot be ruled out as the details of payment of credit sale dues have not been communicated to the restaurant office and the same has been found to be in arrears with the department concerned. However, the payments made to your department through credit sales should be reported to the Ministry Restaurant Office along with the details of the amount paid earlier through NEFT/ ECS in the bank and the amount to be paid later.
