Preamble: The Government has decided to engage the services of Government/ Paramilitary retired officers on contract basis for certain work. Issued on 17.12.2016. As per the provisions of the said rule, at the time of appointment on contract basis, the amount equivalent to the pension received at the time of such appointment with dearness allowance (excluding partial pension) is fixed as their monthly remuneration.
(2) The value of the pension is deducted from the pension in consideration of the remuneration of the officers whose pension has been deducted in accordance with the said Government decision. However, in case of non-degraded officers, the entire pension amount is taken into consideration while determining the honorarium. So if officers drawing the same final salary are appointed on contractual basis, their monthly remuneration is determined in different ways. Also, if there is a delay in the final pension due to some reasons, then it is time to fix the monthly remuneration on the temporary pension.
So, departments are asked to deduct or how to deduct the depreciated value.
Therefore, in the provision of the said Government Decision, the matter of determining the monthly remuneration excluding the fractional pension while considering the monthly salary and allowances was under consideration of the Government.
Government Decisions: Government Decisions regarding taking services of Government/ Paramilitary retired officers on contract basis for certain works, General Administration Department, Dept. (d) (1) (a) of paragraph 2 of the Act, dated 17.12.2016, is being amended to read as under: (d) Monthly Remuneration and Allowances 1) Monthly Remuneration (c) Government/ Para-Government Service- Retired Officers appointed on contract basis after following the prescribed procedure as applicable to them at the time of such appointment.
