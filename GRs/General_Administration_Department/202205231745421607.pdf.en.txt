Date of release: May 23, 2022
Reference:- Synchronization of General Administration Department. the Government Decision dated 07.01.2021
Introduction: After appointment to the lowest post in Clerk Group-C in different administrative departments, there is no uniformity in the promotion as senior officers after appointment as the level of the chain of promotion to the senior post varies from administrative department to department. Therefore, the clerical employees demanded that the same stages of promotion should be created for the clerical cadre in government offices.
Following this, the government constituted a committee to study the issue and submit a report.
Secretary, R.V.C., Member-Secretary (3. (a) Member Secretary, Department of Finance
The committee has submitted its report and the government is considering the recommendations of the committee.
Government Circular: As mentioned in the Preamble, the report submitted by the Committee constituted by the relevant Government Decision recommends as follows.
" It will not be possible to make the designations of clerical cadre uniform in all administrative departments and to make the designations at all levels uniform and prescribe uniform promotion and pay structure. However, the Committee is of the view that in view of the cadre management and in view of the availability of suitable opportunities for promotion, it would be advisable for the concerned Administrative Departments to consider reducing the cadre strength/ level of promotion in Group-C after separate study and consultation with the General Administration Department, taking into account their functional, manpower and administrative structure requirements. "
In line with the above recommendation, the Committee has suggested that while reducing the cadre strength/ level of promotion in Group-C, the following should be considered: 1) While reducing the cadre strength, it should be ensured that it does not adversely affect the administrative functioning and delivery of services to the citizens.
(ii) Administrative work and the manpower required for it should be taken into consideration.

3) While reducing the number of cadres, there may be a need to merge the two cadres. In such cases, consideration should be given to abolishing vacancies and limiting the financial burden.
4) Reduction in cadre strength/ level of promotion will necessitate re-orientation of day-to-day functions as well as duties and responsibilities.
5) Necessary changes in the structure of the administrative department will be required with the consent of the Finance Department as per the prescribed procedure.
(6) The reduction in the cadre strength/ level of promotion will necessitate necessary changes in the Service Admission Rules and Post-Service Examination Rules prescribed under Article 309 of the Constitution with the concurrence of the General Administration Department.
7) Care should be taken to ensure that the pyramid of the respective establishment is correct. That is, a proper ratio of the number of posts in the feeder cadre and the number of posts in the promotion cadre should be maintained.
In view of the recommendations made by the Committee and the above points suggested by the Committee, all the Administrative Departments are being informed as under:
""" All the administrative departments shall review all the cadres working in Group-C in the government offices under their command (e.g.," Junior Clerk/ Clerk Typist, Senior/ Head Scribe, Assistant Superintendent, Superintendent, etc.) in Group-C. So that the level of promotion in group-C will be reduced.
Anyway, check this out. The proposal should be submitted to the General Administration Department for approval by 31.08.2022. After the approval of the General Administration Department, the proposal to revise the figure should be submitted to the approval of the Finance Department and orders should be issued with their consent.
