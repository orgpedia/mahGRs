Government Resolution No. House 2019/110/ S.No. 44/20-A
Mantralaya, Mumbai- 400 032
The date is October 19, 2020.
(1) Government Resolution No.Nia/ VYAMAS/ 57-I/ 2010/777 dated 10th May, 2010.
(ii) Government Resolution No. Niya/ Vyamas/ Cabin rent/ 2010/1055 dated 29th July, 2010.
(3) Government Decision No. Nia/ Vyamas/ Extension of Closure/ (191) 2014/460, dated May 05, 2014.
The Proposal:
The Resident Commissioner's Office is a leading office in the state government infrastructure in New Delhi, the capital of India, for maintaining coordination with the central and state governments and other state governments, fostering international relations, promoting investment in the state, and carrying out diplomatic activities. In the direction of fulfilling this fundamental purpose, this main administrative system has been working since 1963 in the building first known as' Maharashtra House' and later as' Maharashtra Sadan' on the Sangli plot in New Delhi.
In order to make the stay of visitors in New Delhi comfortable, the State Government has constructed Maharashtra Sadan on Copernicus Road in New Delhi and it has been open for use since 1963.
As per the decision of the government dated 29th July 2010, the rates of the cell phones in the old Maharashtra Sadan were fixed. However, considering the cost of management, maintenance and repair at Maharashtra Sadan, it is necessary to revise the tariff. Accordingly, the matter of issuing a government decision on the revised rate was under the consideration of the government.
Government's decision:
In the background mentioned in the Preamble, all previous government decisions regarding the use of rooms and other facilities in the old Maharashtra Sadan are being cancelled. The following provisions are being made in respect of rates and usage of facilities at Old Maharashtra Sadan, Copernicus Marg, New Delhi. In view of the demand for increased reservation in Maharashtra Sadan, the old Maharashtra Sadan is being charged for the convenience of all the members.
