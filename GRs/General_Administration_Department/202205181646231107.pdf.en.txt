Government circular:
As part of preventive measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 virus, the said Reference No. 1 here. As per the circular dated 16.3.2020, the entry pass process of the Ministry was closed till further orders to control the rush of visitors to the Ministry. Reference No. 2 here. As per the circular dated 30.8.2021, for the convenience of the general public in the wake of the COVID-19 virus, arrangements were made to accept outgoing mail at the entry pass windows located near the Mantralaya Garden Gate entrance. In the said circular, it has been stated that during the Covid period, temporary arrangements have been made at the entry pass windows of the Ministry to accept the mail received by the citizens/ employees of the field office and once the system of issuing entry passes to the visitors through the entry pass windows becomes operational again, the system of accepting the mail will automatically end and all these entry pass windows will be used by the Home Department to issue entry passes to the visitors again.
Now reference no. 3 of the Home Department. The Visitor Pass Management System (VPMS), which was implemented to issue entry passes to visitors to the Ministry from 9th May, 2022, will be restored from 18th May, 2022 and the outgoing mail will be actually accepted in the Ministry.
In the above background, it would not be possible for the Ministry Departments to provide the windows for receiving the mails as the possession of the windows is required to be given to the Home Department for providing access to the visitors through the Visitor Pass Management System (VPMS). Hence, the reference No. 2 here. The Government Circular dated 30.8.2021 is hereby superseded and the postal acknowledgement issued at the entry point
