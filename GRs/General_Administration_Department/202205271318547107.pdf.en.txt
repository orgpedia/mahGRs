The Government of Maharashtra
the General Administration Department
Government Resolution No. Sushani 2022/ Q. No. 28/18-A
Ministry, Mumbai- 400 032.
Date: 27th of May 2022.
Preamble: Complaints are received from citizens on various issues with various agencies like Lok Ayukta/ Right to Service Commission, etc. as well as on our government portal. Complaints are often the same. Similarly, these complaints are constantly arising due to some administrative procedures in the administration. Therefore, if some changes are made in the administrative procedure, such frequent complaints will not arise. Also, although there is an office procedure rulebook available for this, there is no manual of good governance on how to work with the principle of good governance in government. Therefore, it is necessary to make such a rule. Such a manual will also be useful for a clean image of the government, responsible administration, quick disposal of complaints, easy, transparent and dynamic and people-oriented administration.
Similarly, the Manual of Good Governance will also be useful for transparency, mobility, people-orientedness, corruption-free office, good governance by avoiding undesirable aspects in governance.
The government was considering appointing a committee to prepare a draft of the Manual of Good Governance and submit it to the government so that citizens can get government services in a more accessible and transparent way and how the gap between the government and the citizens can be reduced.
Government Decision: In view of the above facts, the Government has decided to form a committee as follows to prepare a draft of the Good Governance Manual and submit it to the Government.
