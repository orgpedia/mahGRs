Mantralaya, Mumbai- 400 032
Date: 6th of March, 2019
Read:- 1) Government circular No. 28th June, 2018 (2) Circular to the Government, Public Works Department, No. 2018/ No. 103/ P.S.-4, dated 12.10.2018
Government Circulars: Closets/ tables/ chairs/ stationery/ old documents are often kept in the premises of the new administrative building building in front of the Ministry and Mantralaya. As a result, the roads and surrounding areas look dirty. It also poses a risk of safety hazards and hinders the work of fire prevention measures. Accordingly, instructions have already been issued to all the Ministries/ Departments not to allow any kind of hoarding in the premises of the Ministries/ Offices and in the corridors. However, the departments in the ministry extension building have not yet implemented it. The Public Works Department (PWD) has started the renovation work of the stairway and staircase in the Ministry Extension building. But due to the storage of different sections and similar materials on all the floors, it is adversely affecting the renovation work. For this, all the ministries are being instructed to immediately shift the cupboards and other materials kept in the chhann marg of the ministry extension building to the place allotted to them.
Since the renovation work of the Ministry Extension building has been started by the Public Works Department, all the departments in the extension building should immediately transfer the cupboards and other materials kept in the chhann marg to the space allotted to them.
No storage shall be allowed in the main building of the Ministry, the extension building of the Ministry and the new administration building.
The Public Works Department should take care that no storage is done in the premises and corridors of Mantralaya Main Building, Mantralaya Extension Building and New Administration Building.
