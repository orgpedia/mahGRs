Read: Department of General Administration, Government Decision No: Review 1616 / Q. No. 213/19 - A dated 17th January, 2023
Introduction: The revised format of the General Administration Department has been fixed as on 17th January, 2023. According to the figure, all the posts in the regular pay scale in the Sepoy B Naik cadre have been fixed as super-numerary. Due to non-availability of Naik cadre posts, it is not possible to promote the personnel currently serving in the rank of sepoy to the rank of Naik as per their superiority in service. Hence, the issue of revival of 7 posts in Naik (Group-D) cadre was under consideration of the government.
Government Decision: - General Administration Department Notification No. SRV 2014 / PR No.322 / Ka-12, D. Group-D admissions have been fixed as on 06.06.2017. Accordingly, Naik and equivalent rank are promoted from the rank of sepoy in the ministry cadre with distinction of service.
2. With the demarcation of the General Administration Department, all posts in the Group D cadre have been demarcated. Therefore, 7 Naik posts of Group-D cadre are being revived at the establishment of the Department to provide an opportunity for promotion to Naik cadre to regular sepoy cadre personnel presently working in the Department.
