However, due to the non-availability of four color printing system in the government printing press and due to the availability of sufficient manpower to print and supply the issue within the prescribed time frame, the Department of Industries, Energy and Labor has approved the printing of this magazine by a private printing press.
Government's decision:
As there is no four-color printing system available in the government printing press, the government is approving the printing of the magazine" Apna Mantralaya" for the period from May 2023 to March 2024 by inviting e-tender and following the prescribed government procedure.
