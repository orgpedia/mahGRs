The Proposal:
Lokrajya (Marathi) is a monthly magazine published by the Directorate General of Information and Public Relations. This magazine is an effective medium of communicating the government's policies and schemes to the people. Since the government printing press does not have sophisticated machinery, the printing of new attractive forms in four colors and large quantities of magazines within the stipulated time frame cannot be done in the government printing press, the monthly" Lokrajya" (Marathi) is printed by the private printing press through the Directorate General of Information and Public Relations with the consent of the Department of Industry, Energy and Labor.
The Department of Industrial Energy and Labour, while agreeing to the proposal earlier, had given its opinion to continue this procedure till the modernization of the Government Press. Therefore, the Government was considering to extend the validity of this procedure of printing this monthly magazine by private printing presses through the Directorate General of Information and Public Relations for a period of one year from April 2022 to March 2023 and from July 2020 to March 2022.
Government's decision:
As there is no four-color printing system available in the government printing press, under the decision of the government, it was approved to print the magazine Lokrajya (Marathi) for a period of one year from April 2019 to March 2020 by inviting e-tender and following the prescribed government procedure. Due to lockdown in the country from March, 2020 due to COVID-19 pandemic, Lokrajya (Marathi) magazine was not printed from April 2020 to June 2020.
