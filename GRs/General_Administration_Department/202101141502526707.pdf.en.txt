Preamble: Proposals for filing of charges under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 are sent by the Anti-Corruption Bureau for prior approval of the competent authority. The Government has issued instructions from time to time in accordance with the relevant Government decisions regarding the action to be taken on the proposals received for this prior approval. Complaints against public servants are filed with the approval of the competent authority. However, the complaint sanction order is not received with the signature of the competent authority. The Anti-Corruption Bureau has pointed out that there have been cases of acquittal of public servants on the ground that the Ministers have not approved it and the competent authority has not taken adequate care in issuing pre-charge sanction orders. The matter was under consideration of the government to give instructions to the competent authority in this regard.
Government circular:
(1) The Government of Maharashtra Rule No. (13) An order of the State Government shall be signed by the Secretary, the Joint Secretary, the Deputy Secretary, the Under Secretary or such other officer to whom special powers have been conferred in that behalf; and such signature shall be deemed to be a proper copy of such order.
There is a provision that will be considered as authentication. These rules have been framed in exercise of the powers conferred by Article 166 of the Constitution of India.
Article 166 of the Constitution of India deals with the conduct of business of the Government of a State.
Clause (1) of the Article 166 requires that all executive action of a State Government shall be expressed to be taken in the name of the Governor.
Clause (2) of the Article 166 provides that orders and other instruments made and executed in the name of Governor shall be authenticated in such manner as may be specified in rules to be made by the Governor, and the validity of an order or instrument which is so authenticated shall not be called in question on the ground that it is not an order or instrument made or executed by the Governor.

Clause (3) of the Article empowers the Governor to make rules for more convenient transaction of the business of the Government of the State and for the allocation among Minister of the said business.
The Department of Personnel and Training, Government of India, in consultation with the Ministry of Law and Justice, has issued a notification in this regard regarding Evidence of Sanctioning/ Signing/ Authenticating Authority. Orders have been passed under 10/11/2008. The operative part of this command is as follows:
The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Md Iqbal Ahmed vs. State of AP 1979 Cr LJ 633 (SC) and in the case of State of Rajasthan Vs. Dr. A.K. Dutta AIR 1981 SC has held that the requirement of proving the sanction can be done in any two ways-either by producing the original sanction which itself contains the facts constituting the offence and the grounds of satisfaction or by adducing evidence aliunde to show that the facts were placed before the sanctioning authority and the satisfaction arrived at by it. In the case of CBI, Hyderabad vs. P. Muthuraman 1996 Cr LJ 3638, it was held that signature on the sanction should be proved either by the sanctioning authority or by his subordinate officer or clerk who has seen the sanctioning authority or who is acquainted with the signature of the sanctioning authority. Once the signature is proved and if the sanction order is a speaking order, then the matter ends there; otherwise evidence should be adduced to prove that the sanctioning authority had perused the material before according sanction which may not be in a particular form. In the case of Babarali Ahmedali Sayed V. State of Gujarat 1991 Cr LJ 1269 (Guj) it was held that if facts appear on the face of sanction then there is no question of proving it by leading evidence of authority who has accorded sanction to prosecute.
No separate evidence is required to be led to show that relevant facts were placed before the authority. If the facts are not appearing on the face of the sanction, then it can be proved by independent evidence that sanction was accorded after those facts had been placed before the sanctioning authority.
In the case of State Vs K. Narsimhachary (2006 Cr LJ 518 SC), the Appex Court has held that the prosecution sanction order being a public document, there may not be a need to summon sanctioning authority as prosecution witness provided the prosecution proves that all the relevant material was placed before the sanctioning authority and the sanction was accorded thereafter.
There are several other judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court and other High Court reiterating the above legal position.
Therefore, in the light of the catena of judgments on the subject, it is evident that if the sanction is accorded by the competent sanctioning authority and it contains the facts constituting the offence and the grounds of satisfaction, there is no requirement for the prosecution to summon the sanctioning/signing/authenticating authority for their personal evidence to prove the validity of the sanction. If at all necessary, the same can be corroborated by producing the original sanction and by examining the person conversant with the signature of the sanctioning authority/signing/authenticated authority. Accordingly there is no requirement for the prosecution to insist on personal evidence of sanctioning /signing/authenticated authority for proving the validity of the sanction as the same can be proved adequately otherwise.
However, if the prosecution sanction is challenged by the defence on the grounds of competence of the sanctioning authority or non-application of mind and if a prima-facie for doubting the validity of the sanction is made out by the accused, the trial court would be within page 4 of 2.

its powers under the provisions of section 311 of the Cr. P.C. to summon the sanctioning/ signing/authenticating authority.
All the concerned authorities/investing agencies may keep the above settled legal position in view of taking steps for proving the validity of the sanction and ensure that the sanctioning /signing/authenting authority may not be routinely included in the list of witnesses for the Prosecution.
