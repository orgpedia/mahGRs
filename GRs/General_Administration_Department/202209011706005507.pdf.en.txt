Introduction: Gondia Airport is under the control of Airports Authority of India and has been included in the second phase under the Regional Connectivity Scheme of the Central Government. The Airport Authority of India (AAI) has informed that some works related to the runway of Gondia Airport are incomplete and the diversion of both the roads is required to be expedited as the Khatiya-Birsi Kamtha State Highway and Kamtha Parswada Major District Road pass through the runway. Since this work has not been done yet, there is a lot of difficulty for night flights and for the flight of Air Bus 320 and to be able to provide this service from Gondia Airport, both the roads need to be diverted.
The necessary land for the development of Gondia airport needs to be acquired and a" Board of Editors" needs to be appointed by the state government for this land acquisition. Therefore, the matter of appointing an" Editorial Board" for the acquisition of land required for the development of Gondia Airport was under the consideration of the government.
Government's decision:
Maharashtra Airport Development Company Limited is being appointed as the Editorial Board for acquiring the required land for Gondia Airport. Also, the District Collector, Gondia is being authorised to acquire the required land.
