The present rates of room and catering services in Sahyadri and Nandagiri State Guest Houses were fixed in 2008. As no official document is in place, the government was considering a proposal to revise the rates of catering services at Sahyadri and Nandagiri state guest houses in view of the difficulties faced by various departments in clearing payments, as well as the increase in prices of food, services and ancillary items over time and to maintain the highest standards of facilities provided in the state guest houses. For this purpose, Government Decision No. 2014/ PR No. 180/31 (Royal Decree), d. The committee was established on November 25, 2014. The committee visited various five star hotels, establishments, etc. and collected information about the prices there as well as how much raw material is actually required to prepare various food items served in the state guest houses. The Committee considered the incidental factors like the increase in the prices of existing raw materials to enable revision of existing prices and what is being charged elsewhere for providing high quality catering facilities. After considering all these factors and considering the recommendations made by the committee to the government, the government has decided to revise the accommodation and catering rates in Sahyadri and Nandagiri state guest houses.
