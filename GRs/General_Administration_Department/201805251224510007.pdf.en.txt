2) The transferred employees should be made to join without delay after they are relieved from their respective departments. The establishment officer of the concerned department will be held responsible if there is a case of non-payment of salary and allowances due to non-recruitment of an employee by fixing a mandatory waiting period.

Since the transfers are required to be effected effectively, the salary of all the transferred employees as on 31.5.2018 should be deducted by the department in which they are presently working. The salary from 1.6.2018 should not be withdrawn from the department before the transfer under any circumstances. After the concerned employee appears in the transfer department, the post-transfer department should draw the salary and submit the report to the General Administration Department. Instructions are being issued to all the administrative departments that if the drawing and disbursement officer of the department who was working before the transfer of salary from 1.6.2018 is paid, he will be held personally responsible. The remuneration of all the transferred employees as on 31.5.2018 is to be paid by the existing department and the remuneration from 1.6.2018 is to be paid by the transferred department.
If the transferred employees of the Department are not relieved by 31.05.2018 (M.No.), the Government may take action as per Decision No. It may be noted by all concerned that action will be taken by the General Administration Department as per the provisions of SAMARK 2016/ PR No. 186/16/ K-14 dated 23.12.2016.
