Preamble: - Reference No. Created by the Government Decisions 1 to 5, there are currently 2 panels of contractual vigilance officers, namely, Group-A and Group-B, and Group-C and Group-D.
The Contractual Enquiry Officer system is an important factor in disciplinary proceedings of Group-A to Group-D government officials / employees across the state. However, at present, due to lack of adequate regulation, the system is not fully utilized by the competent disciplinary authorities. As a result, the load on the regional divisional investigation officers is increasing and the cases are pending for a long time. In some cases, court cases are occurring. This is the background, Reference No. It was under the consideration of the Government to devise measures for the empowerment and regulation of the system and to lay down the criteria for appointment, by amending the provisions of Government Decisions 1 to 5 relating to the contractual watch officer system.
The Government's Decisions:
Divisional conviction in disciplinary cases against government officers / employees in the state.
A decision has also been taken to conduct a contractual inquiry by the officers' body and accordingly, 3 separate panels of retired civil servants viz., Group-A, Group-B and Group-C / D will be published by the General Administration Department and these lists will be revised from time to time as per the requirement.
