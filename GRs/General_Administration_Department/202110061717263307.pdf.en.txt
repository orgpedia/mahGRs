Preamble: The Government has taken a policy decision to provide two years training under the Combined Competitive Training Programme (CPTP) to the officers to be appointed in the Government service through the State Service Examination by the Maharashtra Public Service Commission. At the beginning of the program, the training program included the cadres of Municipalities/ Municipal Councils, Chief Officers Group-A and Group-B under the Urban Development Department. However, due to some immediate technical difficulties in the training of the officers of the said cadre, the said cadre was excluded from the training programme under the consolidated purview by a Government Decision referred to in Annexure 4 above. Now a proposal has been received from the Urban Development Department regarding the re-inclusion of these cadres in the CPTP and the matter of including the cadres of Municipal Corporations/ Municipal Councils, Headmasters Group-A and Group-B in the combined probationary training program is under the consideration of the Government. The government has taken the following steps in this regard:
Government Decision- The Government is approving the inclusion of 2 cadres namely Nagar Palika/ Nagar Parishad, Headmaster Group-A and Group-B under Urban Development Department in the 28 cadres presently included in the training programme under the combined review. The candidates recommended by the Maharashtra Public Service Commission through the State Service Examination in the cadre of Municipal Corporation/ Municipal Council, Headmaster Group-A and Headmaster Group-B will be trained under the said training program as compared to the candidates of the cadre who were earlier included in the training program under the combined examination. Recommended candidates in this cadre will undergo all stages of the Combined Probationary Training Programme.
