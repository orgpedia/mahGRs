Circular:
The public authority is required to disclose the information prescribed under Section 4 (1) (b) of the RTI Act on its own or on a positive basis. Section 4 (2) and Section 4 (3) prescribe the manner in which this information is disseminated. To make the functioning of public authorities more transparent and to reduce the need for individual application of Right to Information, to ensure greater public access to public domain information on a positive basis.
Public authorities are required to disclose information on their own under section 4. In this regard, the state government has issued instructions to all public authorities through government decisions/ circulars from time to time.
However, the flow of second appeals to the State Information Commission is increasing and the pendency of appeals is also increasing.
For this, Section 4 of the Right to Information Act needs to be implemented more effectively. Voluntary disclosure by public authorities of the information sought under the Right to Information Act on a large scale will reduce the volume of RTI applications. The First Appellate Authority should review the compliance of its order if it seeks to satisfy the applicant so as to help reduce the number of second appeals to the Commission.
The above matters are being brought to the notice of all the Departments and Heads of Departments/ Public Authorities under them.
