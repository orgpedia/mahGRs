As the government has restricted direct recruitment, it will not be possible to provide other assistant cell officers in place of the post being vacated by the deputation. However, the departments should note that the Assistant Cell Officers will be provided to the department according to the percentage of vacancies in the department to the extent that the candidates will be available from the direct service, limited departmental competitive examination and promotion.
