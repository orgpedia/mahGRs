Read: 1) Government Circular No: Samay 1006/ Q. No. 33/2006/18 (Rs. And why ). 30.6.2006 2) Government Resolution No.: SANKIRN-2014/ Q.No. 80/18 (Rs. And why ). 31.12.2014
Circular:
The government has taken a decision. As on 31.12.2014, it has been decided to provide flexible office attendance timings to the officers/ staff of the Ministry. Also in this context. As per the Government Circular dated 30.06.2006, all officers and employees of the Ministry have been instructed to register their office attendance on the biometric system. After the fire incident at Mantralaya, some departments of Mantralaya are functioning in the building at Public Works Building, Marzban Road, as well as in the building at GT Hospital. Both these buildings are located at a distance from Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus. Therefore, it is convenient for the officers and staff coming to the Ministry from CSMT to register their biometric attendance on the machine in the said building, as it is at a close distance. It has been observed that a large number of officials and employees of various departments of the Ministry are rushing to the machines located on the ground floor of the two buildings to register their attendance through biometrics. According to the complaint received from the Rural Development Department, Nirman Bhawan, the staff of the Rural Development Department and other ministry employees are getting into trouble for registering their attendance at the punching machine kept in their department, which is seriously affecting the office environment of the construction department. This is not an official matter.
Every officer and employee of the Ministry shall register his attendance through biometric system only in the building where he is working. Attendance in the office is an important part of office discipline. Attendance of any officer/ employee is recorded which means that the concerned officer/ employee is immediately available to work in the office assigned to him. Attendance at a biometric machine far away from the office is a violation of this principle.
In view of all the above, it is being advised through this circular that every officer and employee of the Ministry should attend his office.

The attendance to be made on the machines is to be recorded in the building in which they are posted and on the machines installed in the premises of the building. (For example, officers/ staff working in the Mantralaya Main Building, Annexe Building and New Administration Building are required to punch the machines in the premises of the building. Accordingly, it shall be the responsibility of the Establishment Branch of the Ministry Department to verify whether or not every officer and employee is registering their office attendance.
Employees who do not register their attendance in this manner should not be considered to be present on that day.
All the officers and employees of the administrative department of the ministry should strictly follow this instruction.
