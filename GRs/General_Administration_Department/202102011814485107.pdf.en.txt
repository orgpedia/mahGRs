No. 77/11, dated 24th August, 2015 (3) Government Circular, General Administration Department, No. No. 11/11, dated 2nd June, 2016 Circular
Proposals for foreign tours of officers/ officials of All India Services, State Services and Public Undertakings, Boards, Corporations etc. are submitted to the Recommendation Committee headed by the Chief Secretary through the General Administration Department as per the instructions issued under the above orders dated 29th December, 2014, 24th August, 2015 and 2nd June, 2016. The Chief Minister or the Minister, as the case may be, takes a decision on the recommendation made by the Recommendation Committee.
It was under the consideration of the Government that the norms, procedures and instructions in the above orders regarding foreign tours should be amended and made available in a consolidated form, wherever necessary.
2. All the above orders issued by the General Administration Department regarding foreign tours of officers/ officials of All India Services, State Services and Public Undertakings, Boards, Corporations etc., are now being superseded and consolidated as follows: Officers/ officials/ employees of All India Services, State Services and Public Undertakings, Boards, Corporations, Statutory Bodies etc., undertake foreign tours from time to time for the purpose of training, seminars, workshops, studies/ inspections, growth of trade/ industry, periodic conferences/ programmes of organizations, regular exchanges, etc. The country's precious foreign exchange is spent on these visits and the absence of visiting officials also hampers the functioning of the government. Some tours are unproductive while some tours bring very little benefit to the government. In some cases, it is not in the interest of the government to accept the hospitality of other institutions/ organizations. These aspects should be taken into consideration while preparing the proposal.
The Administrative Departments of the Ministry shall submit proposals for foreign visits in the following categories to ensure that the purpose of the visit is beneficial for the progress and development of the State: (a) Study visits, (b) International workshops, (c) Professional and technical visits to international organizations in the interest of the State, (d) Foreign visits to enter into bilateral economic, commercial, industrial agreements with international organizations on behalf of the State Government (i.e. these visits shall require separate permission of the Central Government. ),

(e) participation in various international tourism related conferences or similar events for the promotion of tourism, (e) visits for inspection or testing of materials or materials, (f) foreign visits by officials as per the approval of the Central Government under the regular exchange programme, (c) if the State Government has received official invitation for industry, commercial, educational, cultural activities from the Government of other countries or from specialized agencies of the United Nations Organization (UNO) or from recognized institutions or regional economic groups or other such international organizations as may be approved by the Central Government and accordingly the State Government includes the concerned officials in the delegation to be sent to the concerned country.
(4) In the preparation of proposals for foreign visits of any official nature, the Ministerial Administrative Divisions shall strictly follow the criteria prescribed as follows:
(1) Proposals for visits which would be of significant benefit to the State Government or which could not be avoided should be considered. The proposal should clearly state the benefits that will accrue to the state government without specifying the benefit of the visit. The Secretary of the Department should certify that the visit will be of significant benefit to the State Government.
(2) In case of tours, the duration of the tour should be kept to a minimum. If the number of members in the delegation is more than three, then its support should be mentioned. The condition regarding the maximum number of members will not be applicable in case of study tours or foreign trips for training.
(3) The Secretary of the Department shall be required to certify that he has personally ensured that the officer's proposed foreign tour does not create a conflict of interest.
(4) Proposals shall not be made for allowing officers and staff who have no connection with the purpose of the visit or who are not fit to be sent on the visit, to travel abroad either independently or as members of any delegation. In this regard, the secretary of the department should certify that the foreign trip is necessary by checking and confirming in person.
(4) Officers/ employees whose names are included in the list of officers of doubtful integrity should not be considered for foreign travel. Officers/ staff facing disciplinary proceedings or judicial proceedings for serious misconduct should also not be considered for foreign travel in general. However, except in serious cases of bribery, misappropriation, moral turpitude, rape, murder, attempt to murder, extortion, etc., only departmental inquiries will be conducted in other cases and in very exceptional circumstances, if such officers are required to be sent on a foreign tour, the Secretary of the Department will be required to certify the same.

In exceptional circumstances, the substantial benefit to the State Government from the visit will be taken into account as a criterion. The proposal will be examined on the same criteria even if the officers/ employees of other organizations besides the government are going to travel abroad and those organizations are going to spend.
The cases of foreign tours of the officers of the All India Service or the head of the department should be submitted to the approval of the Chief Minister with the recommendation of the recommendation committee. Since the Minister has been delegated the power to approve foreign visits in the case of other officers/ functionaries, their cases should be submitted to the approval of the Minister along with the recommendation of the Recommendation Committee.
However, if the proposal for foreign tour includes officers of All India Services and/ or Head of Department along with other officers or staff, the combined proposal should be submitted to the Chief Minister for his approval.
7. The concerned officer/ employee is informed that in some cases of foreign trips, the application should be made with the prior permission of the government. Even in such cases, first, the concerned officer should obtain the approval of the Chief Minister or the Minister, as the case may be, as the competent authority to approve the foreign tour and only then apply for the foreign tour. In exceptional cases, where prior approval of the Chief Minister or the Minister as the competent authority, as the case may be, is not possible due to paucity of time, the application may be allowed subject to obtaining their approval before the commencement of the physical visit, in the case of all officers of the departments under the Chief Minister, as the case may be, with the approval of the concerned Minister of State.

If such a proposal involves an officer of the All India Service or an officer of the rank of head of department in the government, the approval of the Chief Minister should be taken. In the case of other officers, the approval of the minister should be taken. However, if the proposal for foreign tour includes an officer of All India Service and/ or an officer of the rank of Head of Department in the Government along with other officers or employees of the establishment, the combined proposal should be submitted to the Chief Minister for his approval.
9. While forwarding proposals for foreign visits to the General Administration Department for submission to the Recommendation Committee, the Department should clearly state in the proposal that they fit the criteria prescribed in this regard from time to time. Proposals that are not received within the prescribed period and do not meet the criteria will be rejected and sent back from the level of the General Administration Department without being presented to the Recommendation Committee. The secretary of the department should ensure that the instructions in these orders are implemented. Disciplinary action will be taken against the secretaries of the department if they are found to have submitted proposals that do not fit the prescribed criteria ignoring the instructions of the government.
10. Approval of the Central Government will be required after the Chief Minister approves the proposal for foreign tour. The travel approval orders should be issued only after the approval of the necessary ministries of the central government for foreign travel. Only after this order is issued, foreign tours can start.

It is the responsibility of the concerned officer to get the necessary consent in the case involving foreign financial assistance.

No officer/ official of the state shall travel abroad without obtaining permission from the necessary ministries of the central government. It should be ensured that no foreign trip is undertaken with the permission of the Central Government. The Central Government has issued instructions to the Indian Missions not to provide any kind of financial assistance to anyone without proper authorization in this regard. It is once again brought to the notice of all concerned that the Central Government's procedures in this regard must be strictly followed so that the stakeholders do not face any inconvenience or difficulty.
Proposals for foreign visits are to be sent at least three weeks in advance of the date of commencement of the foreign visit for the approval of the Central Government. Therefore, these proposals need to be sent to the Chief Minister's office at least a month in advance to get his approval. In view of this time limit for submission of proposals, the relevant proposals should be sent for consideration at least six weeks in advance so that the recommendation committee has sufficient time to consider and make recommendations.
14.1. Further instructions regarding foreign travel are as follows:
(a) The Central Government has observed that the Indian Embassy abroad was inconvenienced or inconvenienced due to the untimely cancellation or postponement of meetings or seminars scheduled by the visiting officials or public representatives. Such last-minute changes, even if necessary for some unavoidable reason, are detrimental to the Indian Embassy abroad in rescheduling such meetings, and in turn, damage the image of India and particularly the establishment concerned. Keeping these things in mind, the Central Government has issued instructions that all necessary precautions should be taken by the concerned while accepting invitations or scheduling visits. Do not accept invitations or make appointments without prior approval. If last-minute changes are made mandatory, the earliest possible intimation to the stakeholders and subsequent appropriate communication to the stakeholders will soften the adverse and negative signals.
All concerned should strictly follow these instructions.
(b) For foreign visits, the dignitaries of the State Government must have a definite invitation for foreign visits and their meetings with the counterpart dignitaries of the respective country must be fixed so that their position and prestige in the foreign country is not undermined.

The Indian mission in that country is the most appropriate agency to decide what level of participation is appropriate in case of a visit and the feedback from the Indian mission should be given due weightage. It should be noted that political clearance has to be denied in some cases taking into account the necessary factors.
c) While preparing the proposal for foreign visit, it should be ensured that the study tour is useful/ relevant to the State Government and the visit will enable constructive discussions. It will be mandatory to submit a report after the study visit and there will be a prerequisite to submit a report regarding the previous visit while considering approving the next visit.
14.2. Ministers of different departments visit foreign countries for far-reaching economic purposes related to trade, investment, tourism, etc. The visits are made more fruitful with necessary preparations and in consultation with the Ministry of External Affairs and the respective Indian Missions/ Posts. The involvement of the Ministry of External Affairs and the respective Indian Missions/ Posts in the conduct of foreign visits helps in keeping them in sync with our country's policy towards that country, especially while holding discussions/ negotiations during visits with countries with which our relations are sensitive. Consultation with the Ministry of External Affairs/ concerned Indian Missions/ Posts before the visit helps in giving clearance for the visit. In view of the above, the following instructions should be followed: a) No interaction with foreign officials regarding foreign visits and programmes of dignitaries.
To avoid confusion regarding visits and programmes, foreign officials should be contacted through the Ministry of External Affairs and Indian Missions or Posts as per the prescribed procedure. The Ministry of External Affairs and the concerned Indian Missions/ Posts should be consulted in the pre-planning of the visit.
(b) At times, the complete details of the formal programme of the visit of the dignitaries to the State are not communicated to the Ministry of External Affairs or the Indian Missions/ Posts. The Cabinet Secretariat and the Ministry of External Affairs should be informed about the proposed foreign visits (private or official) of the Chief Minister and the Minister. It will also be mandatory to obtain political clearance and FCRA clearance before these visits and inform the Ministry of External Affairs about the same during the physical visit.
(c) The Ministry of External Affairs and the Indian Missions or Posts have been mandated to provide necessary information to the dignitaries of the State Governments before their proposed foreign visits. Use their global contacts to follow up on investment/ business opportunities.
If the tour is postponed after the Chief Minister or the Minister, as the case may be, approves the tour as the competent authority, the proposal need not be re-submitted to the Recommendation Committee. However, in such cases, the department will have to seek the approval of the Chief Minister or Minister, as the case may be, again through the Chief Secretary.
If the proposal is not sent to the Central Government within the prescribed time for attending training, seminars, conferences, then the right of the government officials as well as the officials of boards, corporations, public enterprises, statutory bodies will be taken away and as a result, there is a possibility of undue injustice to the concerned officer. In order to avoid such a situation, all the ministries and heads of departments should ensure that all the proposals regarding foreign trips are handled in a time-bound manner and sent to the recommendation committee as well as to the central government. If there is an officer

It should be noted that if a fair opportunity is found to be lost, it is necessary to fix responsibility and take appropriate action against the concerned and the head of the office.
If the officers/ employees of the government are going abroad on leave at their own expense for the purpose of training, seminars, research papers, etc. and their foreign tour does not put a financial burden on the government, then such cases do not need to be presented before the recommendation committee. However, in such cases, approval should be taken at the government level and the condition that no provisions of the Maharashtra Civil Services (Conduct) Rules, 1979, shall be violated by the officer concerned during the period of the visit should be included in the sanction orders. In this case, no travel expenses, foreign stay expenses or any other kind of hospitality should be accepted from any organization.
18. Proposals need not be submitted to the Recommendation Committee in case of foreign trips for personal purposes such as visiting relatives living abroad, tourism, medical treatment, etc. However, in such cases, prior permission of the competent authority should be taken to grant leave to the officer/ employee. Such tours should not be undertaken at the invitation of any private/ commercial organisation and should not involve any expenditure on travel, foreign stay or any other form of hospitality.
19. All Ministries/ Departments shall strictly follow the above instructions while submitting proposals for foreign visits. Also, such instructions should be brought to the notice of all public sector undertakings, boards and corporations, statutory bodies and government and semi-government institutions under their administrative control and they should be instructed to ensure that these instructions are strictly followed by them.
