Government Circular No.-VASIA-9325 / Q.No.45 / VICHO-9 Mantralaya, Mumbai-400 032
Date - 25th April, 2025
Reference: - 1) Government Circular, General Administration Department, No. 1214 / Q. 22/11, D. 22.08.2014 2) Government Circular, General Administration Department, No. 06.11.2024 Circular
As per the provisions of Rule 8 (5) (b) and Rule 8 (5) (c) of the Maharashtra Civil Services (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1979, in the case of a departmental inquiry in which a Choksi officer is appointed to prove the charge, a government servant or a lawful AISA presenting officer is appointed to present the case before the Choksi authority on behalf of the disciplinary authority. The presenting officer is the serving officer who is appointed with the designation. Detailed guidelines in terms of the duties to be performed by the officer concerned on being appointed as the Submitting Officer are provided in Reference No. 1 of the General Administration Department. Circulars of 22.08.2014 have been issued. Also, instructions regarding forwarding of cases of departmental inquiry to the investigating officer, sample of appointment order of the investigating officer and checklist of documents to be sent along with reference no. 2 of the General Administration Department. Circulars of 06.11.2024 are provided below. (Copy attached)
The Submitting Officer is an important and responsible element of the inquiry process and every hearing conducted by the Investigating Officer requires the Submitting Officer to be present and cooperate with the Investigating Officer in finding out the facts of the case.
Despite the above detailed instructions, it has come to the notice of the Government that the presenting officers in most of the cases are absent during the hearings and are not cooperating with the investigating authority as required. Therefore, it is not possible for the investigating officers to complete the vigilance proceedings within the stipulated time. As a result, Choksi's cases have been pending for a long time. Misdemeanors in cases are retiring, and court cases are emerging. There is a decline in the conviction rate due to the fact that the presenting officer in the investigation case is not cooperating properly. In this context, the pattern of appointment order of the Submitting Officers is given in Statement-1 accompanying this circular and General Instructions on Duties and Responsibilities of Submitting Officers in Statement-2.
3. All disciplinary authorities are informed that the instructions should be brought to the notice of all presenting officers appointed in the cases of departmental inquiry in their possession.
Also, the orders of appointment of the presenting officers to be appointed in the new case should be accompanied by instructions in this circular informing them of their careful compliance.
