In order to take action in accordance with the above decision of the Maharashtra Public Service Commission to change the examination system, the Commission is required to receive complete demand letters for recruitment from various administrative departments within the prescribed period. Separate marks will be allotted for each category for the preliminary examination and separate main examinations will be conducted on the basis of that. Therefore, it is necessary to receive a complete demand letter from all the departments concerned while advertising the posts for the pre-examination. If a category/ post is not included in the advertisement, the category/ post concerned cannot be included at any later stage and the posts concerned cannot be advertised till the next year's advertisement. As a result, the government will not be able to provide employees on time due to non-advertising of posts. In view of this, the administrative departments/ offices should take care to send the requisition letters for the vacant posts to the Maharashtra Public Service Commission within the prescribed time by checking the changes in the service entry rules and ancillary matters as per the procedure prescribed by the Government Decision dated 2.12.2021.
