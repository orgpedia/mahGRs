Government Resolution No. Vipani- 2722/ Q. No.8/ K. 17
Madam Cama Marg, Hutatma Rajguru Chowk,
Mantralaya, Mumbai- 400 032
Date: April 5, 2022
Read: (1) General Administration Department Notification No. EXM-1276/ Seventeen, dated June 6, 1977.
(2) General Administration Department Notification No. Examination 2013/ S.No. 05/17 dated 31st January, 2015
The Proposal:
The Departmental Examination is conducted by the Government of Maharashtra under the Secondary Ministerial Services (Cell Officers) Departmental Examination Rules, 1977 for the promotion of Assistant Cell Officers to the post of Cell Officers in the ministerial cadre. The syllabus of the examination is prescribed by Annexure A of the Examination Rules, 1977. Thereafter, vide order dated 31st January, 2015, while making certain amendments in the Examination Rules, the syllabus was also revised by inserting a revised Annexure in place of Annexure A of the original Rules.
Similarly, instead of making separate examination rules for Assistant Cell Officers in the Maharashtra Public Service Commission and Assistant Cell Officers (Law) in the Department of Law and Justice, their request to allow them to sit for the examination to be conducted for Assistant Cell Officers in the Ministry has been accepted.
In 2015, while revising the syllabus, the rules and regulations that are dealt with in the discharge of duties and responsibilities of Assistant Cell Officers in the Ministry, Assistant Cell Officers in the Maharashtra Public Service Commission and Assistant Cell Officers (Legal) in the Department of Law and Justice were brought together and applied to all of them in a common manner.
However, there are some similarities and differences in the duties and responsibilities of the Assistant Cell Officer in the Ministry, Assistant Cell Officer in the Maharashtra Public Service Commission and Assistant Cell Officer (Law) in the Department of Law and Justice. Therefore, some of the subjects in this common course were not useful to the Assistant Cell Officers of the Maharashtra Public Service Commission, some subjects were not useful to the Assistant Cell Officers (Law) in the Department of Law and Justice and some subjects were not useful to the Assistant Cell Officers in the Ministry. Therefore, it was necessary to revise the curriculum to keep some subjects common for them and some subjects separate.

Similarly, with the passage of time, some new laws, rules have been incorporated in the government affairs, so it was necessary to relax the entire curriculum structure by excluding outdated topics from the curriculum and adding new topics useful for the work.
Hence, the government took this decision. The matter of revising the syllabus implemented under 31/01/2015 was under consideration of the Government.
Government Resolution No. 2 here. The amendments made in the Syllabus of the Secondary Ministerial Services (Cell Officers) Departmental Examination Rules, 1977 under Annexure A of the Notification dated 31/01/2015 are being further amended in accordance with Annexure A annexed herewith by this Government Decision, taking into account the above mentioned background.
