Government Resolution No.Mavaj-2018/ P.No. 239/34
Ministry, Mumbai 400 032.

Introduction: Considering the expenditure on print, electronic and other media of the Directorate General of Information and Public Relations, there is a huge gap between the market value and the financial provision provided under the financial authority. There has been a huge increase in the expenditure on advertisements published through various newspapers, magazines, watchbooks, wall books etc. to make the various policies, campaigns, schemes of the government reach the people. The possible expenditure on matters related to broadcasting government messages and spreading awareness about government schemes is increasing day by day.
Since the expenditure incurred on advertisements is more than the prescribed limit, it is advisable to get government approval for the increased expenditure from time to time. There is no justification for the activities and occasion by wasting time in getting the approval for the expenditure.
The changing nature of the work done by different branches of the Directorate General e.g. Traditional media (e.g. live media, communication media, etc.), newly emerging media due to modern technology (e.g. Social Media), conducting surveys to test the effectiveness of advertising, etc., the Government was considering increasing the limit of the existing financial powers granted to the heads of departments/ offices of the General Administration Department and the Directorate General of Information and Public Relations under the administrative control of the Department in the Financial Powers Rules, 1978, Part-I, Sub-Division-II, as well as revising the expenditure and financial powers granted by adding some financial powers.
Government's decision:
The Financial Powers Rules, 1978, Part-I, Sub-Division-II, No.8, Rule No. 17 (Expenditure on Advertisement), the existing two items (for Newspapers or other print advertisements (Distribution) and for advertisements on TV/ Video Films/ Internet etc.)/ Audio-Video Media (Distribution)/ Creative works for Video, Short Films, TVC (Editing with filming, representation etc., Live Streaming and new financial powers as shown in the attached Form-A), the financial powers conferred on the Head of Department/ Office of the Directorate General of Information and Public Relations under the administrative control of the General Administration Department are being enhanced in the Financial Powers Rules, 1978, Part-II by inserting six financial powers.
