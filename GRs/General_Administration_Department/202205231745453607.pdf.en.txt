Subject: Processing of transfers under the Transfer Act.
Sir, since some administrative departments are asking whether or how the transfer should be carried out under the Transfer Act in the current year 2022, the following clarification is being given.
As per the provisions of the Maharashtra Regulation of Transfer of Government Employees and Prevention of Delay in Discharge of Government Duties Act, 2005, general transfers are made in the month of April and May from the level of administrative department with the approval of the competent authority to transfer every year from the year 2005.
However, in view of the exceptional circumstances of the lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, certain orders were issued by the General Administration Department in April and May 2020 as well as in April and May 2021 regarding non-transfer of general transfers as per the provisions of the Transfer Act. Briefly, only in the last two years, taking into account exceptional circumstances, certain orders were issued regarding the transfer of the General Administration Department.
Now, as per the transfer act, it is meant to complete the transfer process every year within the prescribed time frame.
