4 is being omitted and the revised No. 4 should be read as follows:
" Before communicating with the Maharashtra Public Service Commission, the opinion of the concerned service functionaries of the General Administration Department should be obtained on the matter. After this, correspondence should be made with the Maharashtra Public Service Commission, stating that the opinion of the concerned service office of the General Administration Department has been taken. As to the precautions to be taken while dealing with the Commission, the instructions in Circular No. 1 to 3 are detailed and accordingly the concerned administrative departments are competent to correspond with the Commission from their level. Therefore, the draft of the letter prepared by the department to be sent to the Commission in accordance with the said guidelines need not be re-examined by the General Administration Department.
In view of this, to avoid administrative delays and duplication of work, it is suggested that the administrative departments should not send the draft of the letter to be sent to the Commission to the General Administration Department for approval, but to the Commission from their level. "
