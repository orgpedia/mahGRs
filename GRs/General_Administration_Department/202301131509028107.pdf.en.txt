Government's decision:
1 C.V. The benefit of the one-time promotion scheme being provided as an incentive to the officers of All India Services (IPS/ IPS/ IPS) working in the tribal and Naxalite affected areas as per the Government Decision dated 06.08.2002 has been extended to the officers of the All India Services (IPS/ IPS/ IPS) in the revised pay structure of the 7th Pay Commission.

Further, as per the revised pay pattern in respect of Pay Commission/ Fixation of Pay, the same will be paid to the concerned All India Service Officers as per the guidelines/ clarifications to be issued from time to time by the Finance Department for availing the benefit under the One-Tier Promotion Scheme to the State Government Officers/ Employees. This benefit will be admissible only till the concerned officer is working in tribal/ Naxal affected areas. When the officer concerned returns to the non-tribal area, he will draw salary in the pay scale of his parent cadre in accordance with the previous salary.
The benefits of salary and dearness allowance at the rate of one and a half times the rate made permissible under Government Decision No. 1016/ PR No. 140/2016/ X, dated 12.05.2016, to the officers of the Indian Administrative Service/ Indian Forest Service working in the sensitive areas of Naxal affected areas in Gadchiroli and Gondia districts shall continue to be permissible as per the orders issued by the Home Department from time to time in this regard.
During the period of one and half times salary and dearness allowance due to posting in the vulnerable areas of Gadchiroli and Gondia districts, the officers of the concerned Indian Administrative Service/ Indian Forest Service will not be allowed to avail the benefit of the one-tier promotion scheme and other financial concessions applicable to the officers working in tribal/ Naxal affected areas.
(4) In case of lump-sum promotion and allowances at one-and-a-half times the pay, the dearness allowance and other incidental allowances thereon shall be admissible on basic pay and not on incremental pay.
The expenditure on account of the benefit sanctioned in the above paragraph to the officers working in the tribal or Naxalite affected/ Naxalite affected areas shall be met from the grant sanctioned under the head of accounts under which the salaries of the concerned officers are spent. The orders for fixation of wages to be made in this regard should be issued by the concerned administrative departments.
