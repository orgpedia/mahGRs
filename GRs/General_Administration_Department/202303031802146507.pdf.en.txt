Preamble: On the occasion of the Amrit Mahotsav of Independence, the State Government has announced to start the process of recruitment of 75 thousand posts, for which the restrictions on recruitment have been relaxed for some time. The recruitment process has already started.
In the meantime, representations have been received from some public representatives. These representations have been made on various grounds (e.g. Corona, defective demand letters and non-sending of demand letters, etc.) Due to insufficient advertisements, candidates who did not get a chance to appear in the examinations and their maximum age limit is over, the government should take a positive decision on giving relaxation in the upper age limit so that such candidates get a chance to appear in the examinations. In this background, the matter of giving relaxation in the upper age limit to the candidates was under consideration of the government.

2) The posts for which the service entry rules of the respective posts are subject to reference for certain reasons. The maximum age limit prescribed is different from the maximum age limit prescribed in 25.04.2016.

(3) The relaxation in the upper age limit as per (1) and (2) above shall also be applicable for all such advertisements which have been published before the date of this Government decision but the time for submission of applications by the candidates has not yet expired. in accordance with the relevant
