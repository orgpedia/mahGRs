Maharashtra State Regulation of Transfer of Government Servants and Prevention of Delay in Discharge of Government Duties Act, 2005, General Administration Department, Government Notification No.SRV-2004/ PR No. 15/04/12, D. General Administration Department, Government Circular, No.SRV-2004/ Q.No. 15/04/12 D. 7.6.2006 3) General Administration Department, Government Resolution No. SRV-2010/ PR No. 210/10/12 D. 3.6.2011
According to the Transfer Act, a government employee is a person employed in a particular area (e.g. district, state, and department level). While giving the advertisement of recruitment, the selected candidate has been mentioned at what level he is transferable and he has full idea and knowledge of it and he voluntarily accepts appointment in government service in that post through examination. Therefore, he is entitled to accept the transfer made at that level/ periphery as per the Transfer Act.
However, at times, after a few years of appointment, some exceptional personal difficulties arise in the future of the employees, which necessitates the permanent inclusion of the concerned government employee in a government office outside his transferable level/ jurisdiction. In such a situation, considering the limitations of the Transfer Act, to address it from a humanitarian point of view, the reference No. The policy of out-of-cadre transfers was determined by the Government Decision of 3.
At the time of implementation of this policy, it was observed that the policy was being resorted to for any general personal difficulties irrespective of the original purpose of this policy.
Such out-of-cadre transfers, without taking into account the exceptional circumstances of the case, are adversely affecting the functioning of the administration by leaving the posts in the parent cadre vacant. Also, it has been observed that due to misinterpretation of this policy, wrong action is being taken at the field level. It is for this reason that this policy needs to be revisited.

The Government Resolution No. 3 here. The Government Decision dated 3.6.2011 is being superseded and the policy for permanent induction from the establishment of one appointing authority to the establishment of another appointing authority under the cadre is being decided as per the request of the Government employee.
