Preamble: As per the Government Circular dated 02.02.2023 of the General Administration Department, instructions have been issued to all the administrative departments of the Ministry and the Regional Offices to take immediate action on the mail received by the Ministries and the offices under them and to avoid wastage of time. Further, the Directorate of Information Technology vide circular dated 23rd February, 2023 has laid down the standard operating procedures for the use of e-Office system in the administrative departments of the Ministry as well as in the field offices with effect from 01st April, 2023. Accordingly, the General Administration Department has been started with effect from 13th April, 2023 to receive daily mail from the general public as well as from the Regional Offices in the Ministry through the Central Postal Unit (CRU) at the main gate of the Ministry. When we look at the postal mail received at the Central Post Office since April 2023, the amount of scanned mail is very less compared to the physical mail. A large number of physical mails are still being received in the registered branches of the administrative departments. as well as at the district level

Even when 100% of the work of the offices is done through e-office, the employees of the district office re-deposit the mail in the central post office to get access to the mail. As a result, the number of postage stamps seems to have increased. Also, considering the need to immediately resolve the technical difficulties faced while working in the complete e-office system of the Central Post Office, the matter of starting a Project Management Unit for management and control of this Central Post Office was under the consideration of the Government.
Government Decision: A Project Management Unit (PMU) is being set up at the Central Post Office (CRU) at the main entrance of the Ministry for management and control. The Department of Information and Technology was informed through a letter dated July 12, 2023, that the officers of NIC, IT and General Administration Department will be included.
