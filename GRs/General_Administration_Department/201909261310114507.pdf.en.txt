The Proposal:
In order to ensure the credibility of the Photo Electoral Rolls of all the Assembly Constituencies in the State of Maharashtra, as per the orders of the Election Commission of India, Booth Level Officers have been appointed for each polling station.
Voter registration is a continuous process and the polling station level officers (BLOs) play a vital role in this. The work is carried out by the polling station level officers, especially under the electoral roll revision programme, by conducting special campaigns of voter registration, door-to-door voter registration for registration of voters of a particular category, as well as collection of special information of voters as per the directions of the Commission from time to time. Polling station level officers (BLOs) assist the Electoral Registration Officers (EROs) in correcting the photocopy of electoral rolls, distributing voter slips to voters and attending the polling station on the day of poll. Since they are performing these functions in their parent offices, they are paid honorarium as per the Government decision dated 21st March, 2014.
However, the Election Commission of India vide its letter dated 08.07.2015 has directed the Polling Station Level Officers to deposit Rs. 5000/- instead of Rs. Rs 6000/-. Accordingly, a proposal to increase the remuneration of polling station-level officers was under consideration of the government.
