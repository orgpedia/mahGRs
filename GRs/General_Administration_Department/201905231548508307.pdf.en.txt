The Proposal:
Many times there are differences among various departments regarding the handling of legislative issues, attention-grabbing suggestions, etc. The structure and procedures for adjudicating cases regarding which department should handle such questions are widely available to the executive. On perusal of these cases, it has been observed that majority of the cases are being referred for adjudication to the Structure and Procedure Office of the General Administration Department without any requirement.
Therefore, it was under the consideration of this Department to issue instructions as to how the issues of the Legislature, the attention-grabbing suggestions, etc. would be dealt with at the level of the concerned Ministries/ Departments. Detailed instructions in this regard are given below.
Government Circular: The following instructions shall be strictly followed by the Ministries/ Departments while dealing with questions of Legislature, attention seeking suggestions, etc.

Government Circular No: KAKAP 1819/ PR No. 24/18 (Rs. And why )
Questions of the Legislature, interesting suggestions, etc., are to be dealt with by the Departments identified by the Legislature Secretariat and only in exceptional cases the case structure and procedure are required to be submitted to the Executive for adjudication.
The matter should be submitted at the level of Secretary while proposing for award/ transfer.
The department which has received the question should first seek a report regarding the question from the zonal office. Also, the report, relevant rules, government decisions to be submitted for adjudication of the case should be made available on the notice, otherwise the case will not be accepted.
Part I of the questionnaire contains the representations made by the members of the Legislative Assembly to the Government. However, as the statement is not available in the section, many times there may be a delay in sending the answer to the question. Paragraph 5 of the Circular dated 27th July, 2015 of this Department provides for maintaining a separate register for representations received from the public representatives. Accordingly, the ministry departments and subordinate offices should keep such records. In this way, it will be easier to find the statements of public representatives if there is a separate register.
(5) The department to which the question is referred is required to seek an award and the department to which the question is proposed to be transferred is not required to seek an award. Therefore, the request for adjudication should be made by the department in question.
6. While rejecting the transfer of the question, the concerned department must explain the detailed reasons behind it, including the provisions of the government decision, previous correspondence, etc.
7. In view of the time limit for sending the reply to the question of the Legislature, it is necessary to immediately inform the concerned department about the acceptance of the transfer by giving top priority to the matter.
The majority of the departments are of the view that if there are questions related to more than one section, then the section to which question number 1 belongs should be dealt with. This assumption is completely wrong and as per instructions number 54 and 54A under the Government Rules, such question/ resolution/ calling attention notice/ short notice/ curtailment notice etc.

If there is a difference of opinion between the departments under the control of the same Minister on any question, the directions of the concerned Minister shall be taken on that question in accordance with the instructions of Rule 8 (2) of the Government Rules. Industries, Power and Labour Department or Home, Transport, Ports, etc.), when there is a difference of opinion on the handling of the related issues, the Departmental Structure and Procedure Office is expected to adjudicate on which sub-division should handle the issue. Such cases should not be referred to the General Administration Department for adjudication.
10. In cases where action is taken by the Collector/ Municipal Corporation/ Zilla Parishad, many departments are of the view that the matter should be handled by the Revenue Department, Urban Development Department and Rural Development Department respectively as their administrative departments. However, the said offices only implement the schemes/ Acts/ Government decisions of various departments of the Ministry. Therefore, the question of legislature has to be dealt with by the department to which the concerned scheme/ act/ government decision belongs.
11. In case of representations or demands relating to different departments having more than one demand, the department in whose jurisdiction the issues/ demands are higher, shall deal with the issues by obtaining information from other departments. If the number of demands of all the departments is the same, then the department which has received the reference should handle it by seeking information from other departments.
12. If any question is received regarding loss of agriculture/ agricultural land/ life or house due to breach of embankment due to flood or heavy rain, action should be taken as per instructions in the said Reference-3 dated 24.02.2099.
13. As per Rule 11J of the Prevention of Delay in the discharge of Government Duties Rules, 2013, if an award is made at the level of Secretary, Department of Structure and Procedure, General Administration Department, as to which department should handle the matters related to the Legislature in accordance with this Schedule, then the Secretary shall be appointed as the Secretary. Chief Secretary or Secretary. If there is no other direction from the Chief Minister, it is final. Since this provision is self-explanatory, the matter should not be re-submitted to this Division for reconsideration of the award.
There will be no comments from these departments on such matters.
However, the above instructions shall be strictly followed by the Secretaries of all the Ministries and Departments. If they are not complied with or sent to the General Administration Department for adjudication, it will not be taken into consideration. If there is a delay in sending a reply to this question, the responsibility will be of the secretaries of the concerned departments.
