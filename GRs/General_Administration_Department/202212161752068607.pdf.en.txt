In the circular dated 17 th November, 2022, instructions have been issued to complete the entire process of writing the performance appraisal report for the year 2021-22 of the government officers/ employees by 31.12.2022.
However, it is observed that still 20% of PARs are pending at the self-assessment/ reporting/ review stages.
In view of the technical difficulties faced in filing the performance appraisal report in the Mahapar (especially the difficulties faced by the newly inducted officers in the Mahapar) as well as the winter session of the legislature, the due date for completing the entire process of writing the performance appraisal report is being extended till 15.1.2023. The extension will be final.
Confidential reports for the year 2021-22 in respect of the officers involved in the Mahapara will be closed in the Mahapara system on 16th January, 2023. The performance appraisal reports for the year 2021-22 in respect of officers/ staff not included in the Mahapar should be finalized by 15th January, 2023.
It shall be the responsibility of the concerned Establishment Officer/ Processing Officer to ensure that all these actions are taken within the time mentioned above.
