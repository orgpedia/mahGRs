The State Pay Revision Committee has submitted its report on the implementation of the Sixth Pay Commission. submitted to the Government on 20.12.2008. As per para 3.24 of the report," 5 per cent of officers/ staff in pay bands other than PB-4 shall be granted increment at the rate of 4 per cent instead of the normal increment of 3 per cent for outstanding work. Such an increase in salary should be approved once in 5 years for the concerned employees. Since the above increments will be sanctioned at higher rates, the present system of sanctioning one or two advance increments should be discontinued. The committee had recommended that the General Administration Department should take action separately in this regard.
The reference No. 2 As per the Government decision dated 27.2.2009, the Sixth Pay Commission was implemented with retrospective effect from 1.1.2006 for the State Government officers/ employees. Till the issuance of this Government decision, some establishments had extended the benefit of advance pay hike to the eligible employees for outstanding work during the period of the Sixth Pay Commission i.e. 2006, 2007 and 2008. Such eligible employees were given advance increments as per the pay scale of the Fifth Pay Commission.
It will take some time to take a decision on the recommendations of the committee. It has been decided to fix the salary of the officers and employees who have been sanctioned advance pay hike due on 01.10.2006, 01.10.2007 and 01.10.2008, temporarily without advance pay hike. This was done by Government Circular dated 03.07.2009.
