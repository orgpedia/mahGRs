Government Circular No. Parivartan-2022/ P.S. No. 45/18 (Rs. And why )
Mantralaya, Madame Cama Marg, Hutatma Rajguru Chowk, Mumbai-400 032.
Date: 25th of August 2022.
Preamble: The Maharashtra Regulation of Transfer of Government Servants and Prevention of Delay in Discharging of Duties Act, 2005. It has been in effect since July 1, 2006. Accordingly, the officers/ staff of the administrative division of the Ministry are transferred from one division to another. Similarly, officers/ employees are transferred from one post to another within the department. Considering the nature of work at the ministry level, after being transferred from one department to another, the concerned officer and employee has to study many laws, rules, government decisions of the transferred department. After such transfers, it takes some time for the demoting officer/ employee to gain knowledge of the subject matter of the respective office assigned to him. It is necessary to study the necessary laws/ rules, precedents and also to get information about the relevant administrative matters, important cases, elections, urgent proposals, cabinet proposals, court cases and other important pending cases and records in the shortest possible time.
At present, there is no provision for transfer of important records, cases and other important information of the department/ office from the retiring officer/ employee to the retiring officer/ employee. Therefore, the concerned relieving officer/ employee has to face many difficulties while working in the new department/ office. It not only affects the efficiency of the concerned officers/ staff but also creates difficulties in maintaining the coherence of important matters/ policies in the administration. Also, the references received in the office, the informal references, the information that the cases have been processed or are pending is not available. Also, information about the preservation of records of references, records of losses, which are completed in the course of the work, and the destruction of such records after the expiry of the prescribed period of preservation, digitization of the records to be preserved is also not available to the officer/ employee.
