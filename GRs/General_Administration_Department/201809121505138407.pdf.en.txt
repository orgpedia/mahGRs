However, while it is mandatory for the Secretaries of the concerned Ministries to attend the testimony held by the Public Accounts Committee, some Secretaries attend the testimony
Even though the schedule of the meeting is announced about 15 days in advance, many times the departmental secretaries inform the committee on the day of the meeting or one day before the meeting to postpone the meetings. It has been observed by the committee that even though the approval of the Chief Secretary is required for this, it is not being approved.
The members of the committee take time out of their busy work from different parts of the state to attend the meetings held for the testimony of the divisional secretaries. However, if the meeting is postponed, the members of the committee have to return without any business.
Not proper. However, in order to prevent recurrence of such incidents in future, all Secretaries of the Ministries are again requested to extend their full cooperation in the functioning of the Public Accounts Committee and all other Committees of the Legislature.
(3) In future, if the Secretary of the Department has to request for the postponement of the meeting due to some unavoidable or very important reason, he should make such a request to the Committee only with the approval of the Chief Secretary. Applications seeking approval of the Chief Secretary regarding exemption from attending the meeting must be submitted to the Chief Secretary seven working days before the scheduled date of the meeting and applications not received within the prescribed time limit will not be considered.
