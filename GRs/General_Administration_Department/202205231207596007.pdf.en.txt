The use of biometric attendance system in all government offices in the state was suspended as a preventive measure to prevent the spread of coronavirus in the offices of the state and to prevent its infection to the officers/ employees of the state. The administrative departments and the establishment branches of the regional offices were directed to take necessary measures to register the attendance of the officers/ employees in the office during this period.
2. Now the Covid related restrictions have been lifted under the order of the Relief and Rehabilitation Department in the above reference No. 3. Attendance in all government offices has been 100%. Therefore, the attendance of all the officers/ employees of the government offices should now be recorded on the biometric attendance system. Thus, as a matter of precaution, the use of COVID preventive measures (e. g. use of masks, social distancing, use of sanitizers) should continue to be voluntary while registering attendance. Establishment branches of all government offices should ensure that all officers/ employees register their attendance on the biometric system while coming to and leaving the office.
The Information Technology Sub-Division, General Administration Department, Mantralaya, Mumbai-32 should ensure that the biometric attendance system in all government offices is fully functional.
