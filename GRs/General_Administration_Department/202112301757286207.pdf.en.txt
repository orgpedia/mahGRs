However, in view of the technical difficulties faced in filing the performance appraisal report in the monsoon and the winter session of the legislature, there are demands from various departments to extend the deadline for writing the performance appraisal report.
In view of the above, the due date for completion of the entire exercise of writing the Performance Appraisal Report is being extended up to 31.1.2022.
The extension will be final.
Confidential reports for the years 2018-19, 2019-20 and 2020-21 in respect of the officers involved in the Mahapara will be closed in the Mahapara system on 31st January, 2022. All pending performance appraisal reports up to and before 2020-21 in respect of officers/ staff not covered under the scheme should be finalised by 31st January, 2022. During this period, all the departments should take action to write a performance appraisal report by conducting a special campaign.
The entire process of writing the performance appraisal report for the year 2021-22 should be completed by 31st December of the next reporting year.
4. It shall be the responsibility of the concerned Establishment Officer/ Processing Officer to ensure that all these actions are taken within the time mentioned above.
