Ministry, Mumbai- 400032.
Date: 4th of December 2023
Introduction: Large-scale excavation is done while building the infrastructure to be built in the state. This excavation damages other infrastructure already in place (e.g. roads, water taps, sewerage lines, telecommunication infrastructure, power lines, gas lines, optical fibre cables, etc.). In order to maintain coordination among various excavating agencies, the Department of Telecommunications has developed a system called Call Before You Big (CBUD) to coordinate between the excavating agencies and the Infrastructure Asset Owner Department and resolve their issues.
Department of Telecommunications, Ministry of Communications. As per the Gazette Notification No. CGDL No. 03012023 241640 dated 03.01.2023, it is mandatory for individuals/ organizations engaged in excavation activities to register on the common system of Call Before u big (CBUD).
