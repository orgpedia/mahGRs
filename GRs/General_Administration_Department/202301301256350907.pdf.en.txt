Government Resolution, General Administration Department No. 2016/ P. No. 130/18 (R. And why ). 24.08.2016 Preamble: In order to enable the citizens of the State to get their grievances redressed online at one place, the" Aapka Sarkar" grievance redressal system has been operationalized in all the 36 districts of the State along with the Ministries/ Departments. The decision in this regard has been taken by the state government.
However, some complaints are still not being made by citizens on our government complaint system. Therefore, it was under the consideration of the government to take action in accordance with the complaints received by the government as well as the government's subordinate offices through the" Our Government Grievance Redressal System."
Government Circular: All complaints received from citizens to the Ministries and their subordinate offices should be dealt with as follows: All complaints received from citizens should be received online through our Government Complaint System.
However, the complaints received/ to be received by the Ministries/ Government Authorities/ Subordinate Offices earlier as well as later in the offline mode should be included in the online complaint system by the office providing online access to the grievance and forwarded to the concerned online for redressal, so that the citizens/ complainants can follow up the complaint online.
Complaints received by any office by post or letter should be added online by the concerned office in the" Your Government" complaint system and forwarded to the concerned in online format for further action so that citizens/ complainants can follow up the complaint online. The complainant should be requested to mention his/ her mobile number on the complaint form so that a short message regarding receipt of complaint can be sent to him/ her.
