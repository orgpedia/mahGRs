Accountant General (Accounts and Accounts)-1, Maharashtra, Mumbai No.PF Misc/ High Court/ JHP/ 106A, Dy. Letter dated 22/10/2018.
As per Rule 29 of the Maharashtra General Provident Fund Rules, 1998, the amount credited to the subscriber's provident fund account was due on the date of his retirement. Also as per rule 28 (4), the samples of the prescribed application to be submitted by the subscriber for final disbursement are required to be sent by the head of the office to the office of the Accountant General one year before the date of the scheduled retirement of the subscriber.
Accordingly, the Accountant General's office was able to make the final payment of the amount of his provident fund to the subscriber retiring as per schedule at the earliest.
However, even though the rule is clear, the final payment applications of the subscribers retiring as per the prescribed age are received late by the Accountant General's office due to administrative delays and the delay in receipt of the final payment by the subscriber results in court cases and the subscriber has to pay interest on the delayed payment as per the court order.
In order to avoid such a situation, the office of the Accountant General shall receive the final payment application within the prescribed time and shall notify all the administrative departments of the Ministry to avoid payment of interest on the delayed payment. Accountant General (Accounts and Accounts)- 1, Mumbai 5 and No. Here are 6 of them.
