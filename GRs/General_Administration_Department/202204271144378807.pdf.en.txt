However, in the examination conducted as per the old syllabus, the Assistant Cell Officers who are absent for the entire examination or have failed in all the subjects, since the Assistant Cell Officers have to take the entire examination as per the revised syllabus, they should clearly mention" All papers as per the revised syllabus" in front of No. 6 in their application.
