The Proposal:
The e-HRMS (Human Resource Management System) system has been developed for the service book of State Government officers/ employees and under this, digital service books of all government officers/ employees are being prepared.

The e-HRMS system has been made available at https:// 115.124.119.238. Instructions have already been issued to all the concerned departments to fill up the details of officers/ staff on e-HRMS system. NIC is also conducting training programmes in this regard.
However, it has been observed that in some of the Ministries/ Departments as well as their Subordinate field offices, the process of uploading the service book details of the officers/ staff in the e-HRMS system is going on at a very slow pace. Accordingly, the following instructions are being issued to all the Ministries/ Departments/ Offices under their control:
