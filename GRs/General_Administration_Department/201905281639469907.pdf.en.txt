The Government of Maharashtra
the General Administration Department
Government Circular No: Narrow- 2018/ PR No. 172/30
Ministry, Mumbai- 400 032.
Date of Birth: May 28, 2019
The Proposal:
Sahyadri State Guest House is the only state government guest house in Mumbai and the entire state to reach near the best and five star status. It houses the residences of Governors, Chief Ministers, Chief Secretaries, Union Ministers, Union Secretaries, Judges of the Supreme Court and other dignitaries. Visits of foreign delegations to this place, as well as important meetings of the state government, besides press conferences/ important conferences of the state government, are held at the Sahyadri State Guest House.
The auditoriums/ auditoriums at the Sahyadri State Guest House are provided to various departments and public undertakings of the State Government on demand basis at prescribed charges. In view of the status of the Sahyadri State Guest House, it has been observed that while very important government meetings are expected to be held there, other less important programs are being taken by making reservations in the name of departments, and a large number of invited meetings are being called unnecessarily. The gathering of more than the capacity puts pressure on the security, cleanliness and food arrangement of the guest house.
Crowds cause disruption to other important events. Resident guests are also affected. Therefore, the matter of issuing an order regarding the availability of auditorium and auditorium in Sahyadri Guest House was under the consideration of the government.
