Government offices were closed since March 2020 in the wake of COVID-19. As a result, candidates appearing for examinations conducted by the Maharashtra Public Service Commission and other selection authorities have not been able to get the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) certificate. In this context, the following orders have been issued.
Since the candidates have not withdrawn the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) certificate due to the outbreak of the Corona epidemic, the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) certificate for the year 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 should be accepted without demanding the Economically Weaker Section certificate for the year 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 during the interview conducted by the Maharashtra Public Service Commission and other selection authorities.
2) Candidates who have been excluded from the interview process on the grounds of their Economically Weaker Section (EWS) certificate should be given an opportunity for interview.
3) There are existing rules regarding submission of Economically Weaker Section (EWS) certificate by assuming the previous year's income before the pre-examination. There is no change in this government circular regarding the candidates who have so submitted the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) certificate of the previous year. However, the candidates who could not obtain the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) certificate due to Corona pandemic before the Pre-Main or Main Written Examination, but did not qualify for interview or for which this stage of interview is not applicable, shall be deemed to have obtained the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) certificate for the financial year of document verification.
The order will be applicable to all government and private schools, colleges, universities, anganwadis, anganwadis, anganwadis, anganwadis, anganwadis, anganwadis, anganwadis, anganwadis, anganwadis, anganwadis, anganwadis, anganwadis, anganwadis, anganwadis, anganwadis, anganwadis, anganwadis, anganwadis, anganwadis, anganwadis, anganwadis, anganwadis, anganwadis, anganwadis, anganwadis, anganwadis, anganwadis and other educational institutions.
