Also, if an officer of the cadre of Deputy Collector is working in the Ministry on deputation, the concerned Deputy Collector shall not be considered for the award while calculating the financial year in which the deputation was working in the Ministry.
2) The selection of the awardee should be done by the head office of the parent cadre in which the transferred officers/ employees are working, after evaluating them according to the Chief Minister Sukarmi Award Scheme.
(3) However, in the case of Technical Officers/ Staff who are transferred to the office in which the officers/ staff of the Technical Cadre are working to look after the work of a technical nature, certain posts are reserved for them and the concerned Technical Officer/ Staff is required to look after the technical work as well as other work of the same pay grade designation in the office concerned, in the case of Technical Officers/ Staff who are transferred to the office in which they are working.
