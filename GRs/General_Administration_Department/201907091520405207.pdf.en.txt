As indicated in the above reference from time to time, the Government in reviewing their cases
The Government has issued the decisions.
Appeal No. 1912/2015). The Supreme Court Given on 16/02/2015
The provisions of Article 14 are as follows:
We, therefore, direct that the currency of a Suspension Order should not
extend beyond three months if within this period the Memorandum of Charges/
Chargesheet is not served on the delinquent officer/employee; if the Memorandum
of Charges/Chargesheet is served a reasoned order must be passed for the
extension of the suspension. As in the case in hand, the Government is free to
transfer the concerned person to any Department in any of its offices within or
outside the State so as to sever any local or personal contact that he may have and
which he may misuse for obstructing the investigation against him. The
Government may also prohibit him from contacting any person, or handling records
and documents till the stage of his having to prepare his defence. We think this will
adequately safeguard the universally recognized principle of human dignity and the
right to a speedy trial and shall also preserve the interest of the Government in the

prosecution. We recognize that previous Constitution Benches have been reluctant
to quash proceedings on the grounds of delay, and to set time limits to their
duration. However, the imposition of a limit on the period of suspension has not
been discussed in the prior case law, and would not be contrary to the interests of
justice. Furthermore, the direction of the Central Vigilance Commission that
pending a criminal investigation departmental proceedings are to be held in
abeyance stands superseded in view of the stand adopted by us.

The Central government has stayed the High Court order.
