Read: 1) General Administration Department, Government Notification No. RTR 2014/ Q. No. 355/12, D. 06.06.2017 2) General Administration Department, Government Notification No. Tamlepr-1081/ Q.No.344/ Twenty-B, D. 06.05.1991
Preamble: Entry into service of the post of Clerk-Typist in the State Government Office under Rule No. 1 has been notified. For the post of clerk-typist, the technical qualification is to hold a certificate of speed limit of at least 30 words per minute in Marathi typing or at least 40 words per minute in English typing.
The candidate who holds a Marathi or English typewriting certificate as per the merit while filling the post is selected for the post of Government Clerk-Typist.
Since the work of the Government of Maharashtra is mainly done in the Marathi language, if a candidate with English typewriting is appointed to the post of Clerk-Typist, he will be given a job under reference No. Marathi typing has been made mandatory under the notification of 2. Although the Maharashtra government functions primarily in Marathi, in some offices, most of the work has to be done in English. If a candidate appointed to the post of clerk-typist in such offices has only a Marathi typewriting certificate, the functioning of English typewriting is adversely affected.
Therefore, it was under the consideration of the government to make English typewriting mandatory as per the requirement of such offices.
Government Decision: As per the provisions of the Entry into Service Rules for the post of Clerk-Typist, while a certificate in Marathi or English typewriting is accepted for appointment to this post, in the background mentioned in the introduction, in order to carry out the actual government business after the appointment to the post of Clerk-Typist, the following instructions are being given by this Government Decision.
1) All the work in the Maharashtra government is done in Marathi language. Therefore, as per the notification No. 2 under reference, after the appointment of a candidate holding only English typewriting certificate to the post of Clerk Typewriter, it is mandatory for him to submit a certificate of speed limit of at least 30 words per minute of Marathi typewriting within 4 years from the date of appointment. Otherwise, the notification provides for withholding of his annual increment.

(ii) Government business is conducted in Marathi language but most of the work in certain offices has to be done in English language. (e.g. offices of Public Prosecutors in Courts and Tribunals) Therefore, if a candidate holding only Marathi typewriting certificate is selected for the post of Clerk-Typist in such Government office, he/ she will be required to submit a certificate of English typewriting with a minimum speed limit of 40 words per minute within 4 years from the date of appointment. Otherwise, his annual salary will be withheld.
The appointing authority should check the candidate selected for the post of Clerk-Typist which typewriting certificate he/ she has in Marathi/ English and take care to mention the appropriate provision in the appointment order as per the requirement of 1 or 2 above.
