the Proposal. -
In today's digital age, social media is used to exchange information, coordinate, achieve GAS, and increase public participation. Social media is a broad concept that includes social networking sites (e.g. Facebook, LinkedIn), microblogging sites (e.g. - Tbitr, X), video sharing platforms (e.g. Media include Instagram, YouTube), instant messaging apps (e.g. Wantsamp, Telegram), and collaborative tools (e.g. Wikos, discussion forums).
However, the ease and ease of use of these media, the instantaneous transmission of information to any corner of the world, and the reach of many people with a single click have also posed some risks. For example, the dissemination of confidential information, the dissemination of false and misleading information, and the destruction of information that is intentionally or mistakenly disseminated. It has also been observed that inappropriate use of social media is being done in violation of government policies or any political event / person by posting adverse feedback in violation of government service rules, etc.
The Maharashtra Civil Services (Conduct) Rules, 1979 have been framed regarding the conduct of government employees. These rules also apply to social media transactions of state government employees.
