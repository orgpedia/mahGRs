The Maharashtra Civil Services (Regulation of Seniority) Rules, 1982, dated 21st June, 1982
As per Rule 4 (2) (a) of the Maharashtra Civil Services (Regulation of Seniority) Rules, 1982, candidates recommended for appointment to the post of Direct Service should join the post within 30 days from the date of issue of their order of appointment or such further period as the competent authority may, in its discretion, extend.
However, the Maharashtra Civil Services (Regulation of Seniority) Rules, 1982, do not specify the period for which the competent authority should extend the period for accepting appointments at its discretion. Therefore, in some cases, candidates are given 1-2 years extension by the administrative departments for their personal reasons, while in some cases, candidates do not join or do not apply for extension to join the competent authority. As a result, government posts remain vacant for a long time, which affects the administrative work. The matter of issuing clear orders/ instructions in this regard was under consideration of the government.
In order to fill up the vacant posts immediately, the following orders are being issued to all the administrative departments under this government decision.
In making appointments, the candidates recommended by the Commission/ Boards for appointment to the direct services, are required to join within 30 days from the date of issue of their appointment order as per Rule 4 (2) (a) of the Maharashtra Civil Services (Regulation of Seniority) Rules, 1982. Accordingly, eligible candidates should be given a period of joining within 30 days from the date of appointment order.
If a candidate fails to join within the prescribed period, he/ she will lose the opportunity of employment and will not be considered for appointment. It should be clearly mentioned in the appointment order that no reason/ request given by the candidates will be considered for this.
(2) In case of extension of joining after the expiry of the prescribed period of 30 days, in exceptional circumstances, in accordance with the Maharashtra Civil Services (Regulation of Seniority) Rules, 1982,

Government Resolution No: SRV-2018/ VIP67/ P.No.207/ Works.12
As per Rule 4 (2) (a), the appointing authority may grant extension of one month only to the candidate concerned to join at his/ her own discretion. Any reason/ request given by the candidates thereafter shall not be entertained.
3) If the concerned candidate does not join even after the extension of time as above, the appointment orders of the concerned candidates should be cancelled and the appointing authority should consider appointing other candidates in the waiting list in order of merit to such vacant posts. However, if a decision is taken to appoint candidates in the waiting list, the seniority of such candidates will be determined on the date they join as per the order under which they will be appointed. They will not be allowed seniority benefits as per the original merit list. Accordingly, the appointment of candidates in the waiting list should be clearly mentioned in the order.
In accordance with the provision of seniority in the said Government Decision, the Maharashtra Civil Services (Regulation of Seniority) Rules, 1982 are being amended as per the provisions.
