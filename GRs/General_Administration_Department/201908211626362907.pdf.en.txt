To set up a committee to study the educational institutions in the state and recommend to the government to increase the seats for educational admissions.

GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: BCC 2019/ PR No. 414/16-B
Hutatma Rajguru Chowk, Madam Cama Road
Ministry, Mumbai- 400 032.
Date: August 21, 2019
The Proposal:
The state government has decided to provide 12 per cent reservation in admission to educational institutions for the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) as per the provisions of the Reservation Act 2018 and the Reservation Act (Amendment), 2019. The state government has also decided to provide 10 per cent reservation in educational institutions for the economically weaker sections of the state in view of the 103rd amendment to the Constitution by the Central Government. While giving reservation to these two units, the reservation in the open category has been reduced. This has led to dissatisfaction among open and other category candidates.
If the total number of educational seats in the state is increased, more seats will also be available for candidates from the open category. Therefore, in order to retain the number of seats available for the open category before the implementation of the above reservation, the government was considering to form a committee to study all the educational institutions in the state and submit a report to the government on how many seats need to be increased in the state.
Government's decision:
After studying the admission seats in educational institutions and considering the reservation seats for SEBC and EWS, the Government is forming a committee under the chairmanship of Additional Chief Secretary (Services) to study the admission seats in educational institutions in the State and recommend to the Government to retain the sanctioned seats in the open category before implementing the said reservation.
