Reference No. As per the government's decision, Airbus was to provide DGCA/ EASA accredited training to government pilots. Accordingly, approval was given to send the pilots of the Directorate General of Aviation abroad for second revision training. But it's training time. 8/7/2021 instead of 16/7/2021. Since there was a change from 7/9/2021 to 1 7/9/2021 and the three pilots had left for training, the matter of issuing a fresh government decision by cancelling the government decision dated 2/7/2021 and giving post-facto approval was under the consideration of the government.
Airbus will provide DGCA/ EASA approved training to government pilots. Accordingly, the following three pilots of Directorate General of Civil Aviation are being given ex-post facto approval to travel abroad for the second revision training within the period mentioned before their names and to bear the expenses incurred thereon as well as to leave the headquarters on 5/9/2021.
