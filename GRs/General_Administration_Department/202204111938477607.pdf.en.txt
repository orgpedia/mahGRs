Preamble: The proposal for obtaining administrative approval and CRC Code (Head of Accounts) for the scheme of strengthening of headquarters and construction of divisional/ district information office building would have been submitted to the approval of the Cabinet. The proposal has been approved by the Maharashtra Cabinet in its meeting held on 9.2.2022 at Mantralaya, Mumbai. Further, the administrative approval for the new scheme has been accorded vide Government Resolution No.118/ K-34/ 2017/ PR No.118/ 2017. Issued on 24.02.2022. The office of the District Information Office, Raigad-Alibag, is working for the wide publicity of all government activities in Raigad district and due to the unavailability of government space or government building at the local level in Alibaug, this office is started on a lease basis in Navre building in Padhyewadi Alibaug. The building is very old and dangerous. The District Planning Building, 1st Floor, which has been temporarily shifted from 21st March, 2020, is grossly inadequate in terms of the functioning, staff and urgency of the office. Therefore, the matter of administrative approval for the construction of a separate building for this office was under consideration of the government.

The proposal has been approved by the Maharashtra Cabinet in its meeting held on 9.2.2022 at Mantralaya, Mumbai.
