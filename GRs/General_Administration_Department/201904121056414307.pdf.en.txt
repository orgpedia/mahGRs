GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: CEL-2019/ PR No. 470/19/33
Mantralaya, Mumbai- 400 032
Date of Birth: April 11, 2019
Election Commission of India vide letter No. 218/6/2019-EPS dated 10.04.2019
Government's decision:
The Election Commission of India conducts elections to fill one or more seats in both Houses of Parliament or, in the case of a State, in both Houses of the Legislature, i.e., general and by-elections to the Council of States, Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies. Election duties are different from the normal duties of government employees. Not only are they required to be completed within a limited time frame, but poll workers face risks and dangers while performing these duties.
Therefore, the government has decided to give ex-gratia to the families of the officers/ employees who died while performing election duties and to the officers/ employees or their families who were injured or died due to any unfortunate incident while on election duty.
