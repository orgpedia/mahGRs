Introduction: The context. As per the Government decision dated 11.09.2019, 20% of the total number of vacancies per annum in the direct services quota will be filled up through compassionate appointment for a period of three years i.e. 01.01.2019 to dt. It was approved to be paid up to 31.12.2021.
The deadline Due to expiry on 31.12.2021, d. Further orders are to be issued as to whether the percentage of posts to be filled through compassionate appointment from 01.01.2022 should be kept at 10% as before or the limit of 20% should be extended for a period of time. In view of the frequent demand for immediate appointment of compassionate appointment, etc. 01.01.2019 to dt. It was under consideration of the Government to continue the ceiling of 20% fixed for a period of three years i.e. 31.12.2021 for some more period.
Government Decision: By a decision of the Government in context, d. As on 31.12.2021, in respect of all posts in Group-C and Group-D of the Finance Department for which there are restrictions on recruitment and for which there are no restrictions on recruitment, it was notified that 20% of the posts falling vacant annually under the direct services quota shall be filled up by way of compassionate appointment.
The Government have decided to fill up 20 per cent of the total number of vacancies in the direct services on compassionate grounds. for the next three years from 01.01.2022 i.e. 01.01.2022 to D. It is being extended up to 31.12.2024.
Further, as there is a lot of confusion among the implementing officers as to how to calculate these 20% posts while filling up 20% posts on compassionate grounds, the following guidelines are being issued in this regard:
1) Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) of compassionate appointment. This has been notified vide Government Resolution dated 26.08.2021. However, the government's decision should be seen as a step towards compassionate appointment.
2) Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) of compassionate appointment. Issue No. 26.08.2021. As per clauses (i) and (ii), the number of vacancies per annum in the direct services shall be determined and 20% of the vacancies shall be filled up by way of compassionate appointment.
Every year, before sending the requisition for the vacancies in the direct service quota to the Maharashtra Public Service Commission or the selection committee, 20 percent of the vacancies should be filled by compassionate appointment and only then the requisition for the remaining 80 percent of the posts should be sent.

Similarly, even if it is not possible to send the requisition for vacancies to the Maharashtra Public Service Commission or the selection committee in the relevant year, due to restrictions on the recruitment of vacancies in the direct service quota in a given year, 20 percent of the vacancies must be filled by compassionate appointment in that year.
(5) In short, even if direct recruitment is not possible due to recruitment restrictions or other administrative reasons, it is mandatory to take action to fill up 20 per cent of the vacancies in the respective year by compassionate appointment every year. This should be done annually. However, if no action has been taken for compassionate appointment in the last few years, then 20% of the vacancies in the direct service quota for that year and 20% of the vacancies in the direct service quota for the current year shall be filled by compassionate appointment.
6) Also, while determining the number of posts for compassionate appointment, if the number falls in less than one fraction, then at least one post in that establishment should be filled by compassionate appointment.
This decision was taken by the Finance Ministry vide its notification No. 526/ Apuk, Dy. being issued pursuant to the approval granted under 06.12.2021.
