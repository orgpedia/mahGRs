All available computers have been distributed to the officers/ employees of the institute and are being repaired in case of failure. At present, administrative approval is being given for the immediate purchase of 5 computers (all in one) and 5 printers of the following specifications as it is necessary to purchase new computers and printers to make it possible to provide a new computer set in case a computer is lost.
