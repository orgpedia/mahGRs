Court, Mumbai vide" W.P.No. 2986/2000, W. NO. 2982/2000, W. P.No. 4958/2003 and W. P.No.3374/ 2011 The High Court. As per the order dated 06.08.2018, the revision of seniority of the cadre of Cell Officers from the year 1986 has been taken up.
For that. The Cell has been constituted vide order dated 12.10.2018. The provisional seniority of the cadre of Cell Officers for the period 1986 to 1995 has been notified. The process of publishing the seniority of the next period is underway. However, it is likely to take some time due to the complex and time-consuming task of revising seniority for a total period of 32 years from 1986 to date. Therefore, during this period, important posts of senior level like Under Secretary in the Ministry are falling vacant, which is adversely affecting the functioning of the government and consequently the development of the people. Considering this, the promotion to the post of Under Secretary is very important.
Currently existing temporary offices. Based on the seniority list published on 24.05.2017, the Government has decided to do so in public interest, considering the administrative urgency.
Order: The following cadre officers of the Ministry Department are being promoted ad hoc to the rank of Under Secretary with effect from the date of this order and posted in the Department indicated in column 5 against their name.
