The Maharashtra Public Service Commission (MPSC) has decided to start a combined probationary training programme for the officers of various cadres who will be appointed in Group A and Group B through direct service through the State Service Examination through the training institutes of Yashoda, Pune and Vanamati, Nagpur respectively. Request for extension of time for various reasons for appearing in the combined probationary training programme is received from these recommended candidates. One year extension is granted for certain reasons after due consideration of the request received from the candidates.
The criteria for extension of time from joining the Integrated Training Programme have been fixed by the Government Decision dated 03/07/2017 and above dated 12/7/2017, superseding the earlier Government Decision No.1-4 in this regard. As per the provisions of the notification dated 7.11.2015 regarding the seniority of the candidates who have been granted extension, it has come to the notice of the Government that the candidates are not taking active participation in the training as the merit of the service of the candidates who have been granted extension is decided on the basis of the candidates who are undergoing training i.e. selected in the later batch. Therefore, it was under consideration to issue a comprehensive consolidated government decision on extension and service excellence by revising the criteria of service excellence of the candidates who have been given extension.
