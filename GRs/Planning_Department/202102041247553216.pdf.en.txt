The main objective of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme is to provide employment to the rural population on demand for unskilled work and thereby create permanent employment. There is a need to think about what are the basic facilities to be provided and for that the objectives must be clear.
In recent times, examples of earning big income by using less land properly are widely available in social media. Taking the example of Mr. Dnyaneshwar Bodke, he is giving Rs. 10 lakh. They also teach others to do the same. Recently, On the directions of the Chief Minister, a handholding program has been started in one village of every taluka of the state to earn income in this way through group farming.
The way Mr. Bodke cultivates requires water, compost, cow dung and cow dung. Of course, if these things are given by the combination of various schemes of Magararohyo, then every farmer can become rich (Lakhpati). For this, they will have to choose a family and give them farmlands, gota, nadep and sukh khara together at the same time. This will lead the farmers on the path of progress. Only then will the objectives of the Government Circular dated 02.09.2020 of the Planning (ROHYO) Department," I am prosperous, village is prosperous" and" Village is prosperous, Maharashtra is prosperous" be achieved.

Affordable use of water
When the village succeeds in stopping the rainwater from falling, the issue of how to use that water in a cost-effective,|R economically profitable and labor-intensive way does not arise. This topic will be dealt with in the training of the" Water Budget."
At the same time, a large number of small farmers in our own state have become rich by using such methods. The story of a farmer Mr. Dnyaneshwar Bodke is telling in this regard.
Mr. Dnyaneshwar Bodke was working on ten thousand rupees per month. One day he read the news that a farmer in Sangli district earns Rs 10 lakh every year from ten guntas of land. This person was there. The news was true. The farmer saw the prosperity that came from such a small piece of land and decided to quit his job and take up farming. The incident was a small one, but this incident not only enriched him but also showed the way to others.
Today, he runs the Innovative Farmers Club. They are rich themselves, but they also teach others how to be rich. At present, more than one lakh farmers are associated with them. A few years ago, the farmers with him bought 305 Maruti cars for themselves on a single day. If there is one acre of land, then how to grow crops in one acre of land, how to do prosperous farming by using 15, 20, 000 liters of water every day, by doing this, today educated boys and girls do not want to work in the field, then how do they work in the field. He explains the concept of polyhouse to provide some work related to agriculture to today's youth who do not like manual work in the field in the heat, cold and rain.
In the above video, it can be seen what Shri Dnyaneshwar Bodke is saying.
He wants all the farmers of our state to be rich and prosperous. For this they are ready to help with training. They are ready to help the farmers of every village, taluka and district. Also, if there are people in your taluka/ district who are cultivating using such polyhouses, then take this help of Google Earth to find such farmers. Alternatively, you can also visit the website of Abhinav Farmers Club www. abhinavfarmerclub. org and contact Shri Dnyaneshwar Bodke through e-mail. Shri Dnyaneshwar Bodke's email ID is abhinavfarmersclub@gmail. Com is. The agriculture department has created a resource back of information of farmers doing advanced farming. The link is http:// krishi. maharashtra. gov. in/ 1313/ Resource-Bank.

Shri Bodke and his family have also written on our request how they started this work, how they overcame the difficulties, and how it is possible for everyone to do so. It is given in Annexure 1 of this circular.
Similarly, if the landless agricultural laborers are given proper training by benefiting collectively from the combination, they will become rich by selling milk, dung, urine, goat rearing, meat, vermicompost, organic manure, etc. There are many such examples in the country.
In this way, we can open the way to prosperity for everyone, be it farmers or landless agricultural laborers.
There is also an equal need to measure the annual income of each person so that every family is motivated to take their financial decisions properly, an app will be developed for this.
Accordingly, the Government is approving the implementation of the State Scheme" Sharad Pawar Gram Samriddhi Yojana" through the combination of some schemes under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme.
Government Decision: Accordingly, the following 4 individual works under the Sharad Pawar Gram Samriddhi Yojana should be implemented in all Gram Panchayats areas with the best priority to every eligible beneficiary demanding work in rural areas.
Dated the 9th October 2012. The government has decided to limit the number of' ghotis" in a village to 5.
1. Construction of pucca cowsheds for cows and buffaloes Current situation: In rural areas, cattle sheds are usually cramped and cramped, and are rarely properly constructed. A large amount of animal dung and urine is lying in the dens and during the rainy season the soil of the dens becomes marshy and the animals stay in this place and they become victims of various diseases. Also, some of the animals are suffering from mastectomy and thousands of rupees are spent on treatment. Sometimes cows/ buffaloes lose their tusks, they get wounds on the lower side of their body. In many places, there is no fodder for the animals. They are fed in the open space in front of them. The animals feed on this fodder due to the frequent shedding of dung and urine.

Government Resolution No: MGRRO-2020/ P.No.70/ ROHYO-7
They don't eat and they waste food. To avoid this, it is necessary to build a barn in the animal's enclosure to feed and feed the animals.
Need for Improvement: Due to the slushy soil in the farm, valuable urine and dung from the animals is not stored and is wasted on a large scale. Since animal urine and dung is an excellent type of organic fertilizer, if the space in the animal enclosure is leveled in a concrete form using cement concrete, the urine and dung from the animals can be collected in the gravel near the enclosure and used to increase the fertility and productivity of the farm land.
Permissibility: According to the provisions of paragraph 3.5.7 of the Planning (ROHYO) Department Government Circular dated October 09, 2012 and Planning (ROHYO) Department Government Decision dated October 01, 2016, 26.95 sq.m. land is sufficient for 6 cattle. It is 7.7 m long. The width should be 3.5 mm.
The 7.7 m. x 0.2 mm. x 0.65 m. A 250-litre tank is also provided.
A 200-litre water tank will also be constructed.
Beneficiaries having their own land as per MGNREGA norms and other necessary documents as per individual benefit norms will be eligible to avail the benefit of this work. Tagging of animals will be required along with the proposal of the herd.
This work has been taken up under NREGA as per Roll No.75 in Annexure-9 of the Government Circular dated 02.09.2020 of the Department of Planning (RoHo) at a cost of Rs. The estimated cost is Rs 77,188. The details is as follows.
Unnecessary expenditure of Rs. 6,188/- (Proof 8%) Skilled Expenditure Rs. 71,000/- (92%) aggregating to Rs. 77,188/- (100% of the amount)
However, this criterion is similar to the prevailing wage rate and DSR. Whenever there is a change in the rate of any one or both of these two, this estimated cost will change. The authority to approve that kind of change is being provided to the District Programme Coordinator/ District Programme Co-ordinator/ Commissioner, Magararohyo.
The government will cancel the provision of 6 cattle in the above circular and will pay subsidy in multiples of 6 for one cow for two cattle to 6 cattle and in multiples of 6 for the next higher cattle i.e. double for 12 cattle and 3 times for more than 18 cattle.

2. Construction of Goat Farming Sheds: Current Status: Goat farming is an important source of livelihood for families belonging to low income groups in rural areas. In order to increase the income of families in low-income rural areas, it is necessary to provide basic facilities for the goat farming business. The poor families who earn their livelihood by rearing sheep and goats in the rural areas are unable to provide a well-protected shelter to the sheep and goats due to lack of money. In the absence of good shelter, various kinds of germs, contagious, external parasitic insects infest the sheep and goats. As a result, herds of sick, furry, and economically inefficient goats and sheep are reared. For this, every family that has demanded it will be provided with the work of building a goat farm under the NREGA scheme.
Need for Improvement:- In rural areas, high quality organic manure produced from cow dung, dung and urine perishes due to lack of good quality manure. If good quality sheds are built for goats and sheep, the health of these animals will also be good and waste excreta and urine can be collected and used as an excellent organic fertilizer in agriculture.
This will help in increasing the productivity of agriculture.
As per the provisions of Para 3.5.9 of Planning (ROHYO) Department Government Circular dated 09.10.2012 and Planning (ROHYO) Department Government Resolution dated 01.10.2016, 7.50 sq.m. shelter is sufficient for 10 goats and its length is 3.75 m. The width should be 2.0 m.
The average height of the walls should be 2.20 m. The roof should be supported by iron beams. Galvanized iron sheets/ cement sheets should be used for roofing. Add the ghee to the bottom. Construct a water tank for the cows.
Beneficiaries having their own land as per MGNREGA norms and other necessary documents as per individual benefit norms will be eligible to avail the benefit of this work. Priority should also be given to landless families.
Permission: This work is being executed under NREGA as per Roll No.76 of Annexure-9 of the Government Circular dated 02.09.2020 of the Department of Planning (RoHo) at a cost of Rs. The estimated cost is Rs 49,284. The details is as follows.

Government Resolution No: MGRRO-2020/ P.No.70/ ROHYO-7
Unnecessary expenditure of Rs. 4,284/- (Proportion 8%) Skilled Expenditure Rs. 45,000/- (92%) aggregating to Rs. 49,284/- (100% of the amount)
However, this criterion is similar to the prevailing wage rate and DSR. Whenever there is a change in the rate of any one or both of these two, this estimated cost will change. The authority to approve that kind of change is being provided to the District Programme Coordinator/ District Programme Co-ordinator/ Commissioner, Magararohyo.
The cow is considered to be the poor man's cow if the beneficiary manages the cow himself. Mostly landless agricultural labourers rear goats.
The landless agricultural labourer is left with no agricultural land to prosper, only goat rearing or similar matters to prosper. According to the government circular, a group of 10 goats is given. Without government subsidy, a landless farmer cannot buy ten goats from his own money. So it is explained that if there is a group of less than ten goats, then it is difficult for the farm laborer to get out of poverty. At present, one goat costs around Rs.
This expense is not covered by the Employment Guarantee Scheme. If a landless farm labourer can buy two goats from his own stock, the number of goats will be at least doubled every six months, so that in one year the farm labourer/ farmer can have a group of 10 goats. Therefore, in view of all the above, it would be appropriate to allow the benefit of this scheme to landless labourers/ farmers who have at least two goats.
It is also clarified that for goat rearing sheds, one group will be considered for every ten goats and accordingly, subsidy will be admissible as per the circular and the beneficiaries who have more than 10 goats will be given double subsidy keeping in view the two groups of goats. However, a maximum of 30 goats per family will be given three times the subsidy.
My father, Mr. Prahladrao Jagdev Bagade, who lived in Akola, had come to Khaparwadi from Buldhana district (Shelgaon Mukund) about fifty years ago to earn a living as a labourer. Here late Bal Mahajan used to earn fifty rupees daily. The parents had initially bought a goat and two chicks (one hundred and forty-five) for a little money from labor. In three years, he sold ten goats and bought two acres of farmland. At first, there was no food and no clothes. In that case, two sheep were left. In the morning after that

Sometimes the father worked, and sometimes the mother worked. Later, he sold the crops and goats from the farm and took up farming on another 3 acres. Being fully aware of the past situation, even today, for about fifty years, the goat has not broken its leg in our house.
Today, we have 15 acres of orchards near the village) and our progress has started from the goat. That is why we consider him as our God.
Today, we are very much in love with goats. Therefore, no one in our family is ready to sell the goats completely. We earn around Rs 50,000 per annum from farming. We currently have 10 dogs and 6 cats.
I believe that the goat is the ATM machine of the poor. Therefore, I humbly appeal to the unemployed youth and women to choose the path of progress by doing business related to agriculture or goat farming and I assure that our progress will not be without it.
Your love,
Jagan Prahladrao Bagade

3. Construction of Poultry Sheds Current Status: Poultry farming provides essential nutritious animal protein along with supplementary production to rural households. There is no good quality shelter for the cuckoos in the village. Their health is constantly deteriorating. It is necessary to provide good quality shelter to the birds to protect them from frost, rain, predatory animals and frequent diseases. Good sleep- This will help protect them, chicks and eggs from predators during the night.
Beneficiaries having their own land as per MGNREGA norms and other necessary documents as per individual benefit norms will be eligible to avail the benefit of this work. Priority should also be given to landless families.
This work has been taken up under NREGA as per Roll No.77 of Annexure-9 of the Government Circular dated 02.09.2020 of the Department of Planning (RoHo) at a cost of Rs. The estimated cost is Rs 49,760. The details is as follows.

Government Resolution No: MGRRO-2020/ P.No.70/ ROHYO-7
Unnecessary expenditure of Rs. 4,760/- (10%) Skilled Expenditure Rs. 45,000/- (90% of the total) Rs. 49,760/- (100% of the amount)
However, this criterion is similar to the prevailing wage rate and DSR. Whenever there is a change in the rate of any one or both of these two, this estimated cost will change. The authority to approve that kind of change is being provided to the District Programme Coordinator/ District Programme Co-ordinator/ Commissioner, Magararohyo.
Permitted: As per the provisions of the Planning (ROHYO) Department Government Circular dated 9th October, 2012 and Para 3.5.8 of the Planning (ROHYO) Department Government Resolution dated 1st October, 2016, 7.50 sq.m. shelter is sufficient for 100 birds and its length is 3.75 m. On the long side there should be a wall 30 cm high and 20 cm thick, up to a brick shoe. Also, the ceiling should be supported by a hinged lattice 30 cm x 30 cm.
The wall should be 20 cm thick with an average height of 2.20 m. The roof should be supported by iron beams. Galvanized iron sheets/ cement sheets should be used for roofing. For the base of the base, the foundation should be poured with a strong layer of secondary bricks and cement in a ratio of 1: 6. The birds need to drink water.
At present, the subsidy is admissible for 100 birds as per the government circular. However, it clarifies that the farmers/ farm workers who want to do poultry farming. However, the beneficiaries who do not have more than 100 birds should demand a poultry shed with two guarantors on a stamp paper of Rs 100 and accordingly the concerned machinery should sanction the shed to the concerned beneficiary and it will be mandatory to bring 100 birds for rearing in the poultry shed within a period of 1 month after the completion of the work of the shed. The shed can accommodate 150 birds, though 100 birds are allowed. So, if the number of birds is taken up to 150 by the beneficiaries who have successfully managed 100 birds, then the beneficiary will be provided double the amount of funds for a bigger shed. However, no family will be allowed more than twice the amount. All other provisions shall be in accordance with the above.
4. Bhoo-Sanjeevani Nadep Composting: Need: Improving soil health can greatly enhance agricultural productivity.
Organic matter in the field waste if processed by composting, biologically, micro

Government Resolution No: MGRRO-2020/ P.No.70/ ROHYO-7
Organic compost manure like humus is prepared by the decomposition of insects and worms.
If this fertilizer is used on a large scale in the field, it can greatly improve the health of the soil and add to agricultural production. In such organic substances there are all kinds of microorganisms in large quantities. Under the right conditions, the number of these micro-organisms increases and these micro-organisms present in large numbers break down the organic matter rapidly.
Principle: As per the provisions of the Planning (ROHYO) Department Government Circular dated 09.10.2012 and Para 2.4 of the Planning (ROHYO) Department Government Resolution dated 01.10.2016, under NADEP Composting, construction of 3.6 m X 1.5 m X 0.9 m size of land is expected from which about 2 to 2.25 tons of compost manure is prepared in 80-90 days. This fertilizer is enough for an area of 0.25 hectares. It is the need of the hour to prepare organic manure from all the plant products extracted from the farm and put it back in the farm. Organic fertilizers increase the water holding capacity of the soil and increase the supply of nutrients. Air moves through the soil, and the soil remains moist. Helps in the growth of useful microorganisms in the field. Holes are placed in all four walls of the construction of the nadap, so that air flows through it, promoting the decomposition of organic matter.
Process for success: After the construction of the nadap is completed, one layer of organic matter/ waste, cow dung soil and soil are laid in it. Usually in the first layer 100 kg of waste is laid at the bottom, it is approximately 6 inches high. 4 kg cow dung is mixed with 125 to 150 litres of water and sprinkled on the first layer. The water level decreases with the season. Above the second layer of this cow dung water, clean soil filtered without stones, glass, etc. (approximately half the weight of the waste of the first layer 50 to 55 kg) should be spread on the second layer, sprinkle some water on it as per requirement. In this way one layer at a time should be formed by making a heap of 1.5 feet above the tank of the nadap tank. Then the top layer of the pile is closed with a mixture of 3 inches of dung and soil (400 to 500 kg). In 2 to 3 months dark brown, dusty, soft, light and odourless compost is prepared.
Beneficiaries having their own land as per MGNREGA norms and other necessary documents as per individual benefit norms will be eligible to avail the benefit of this work.
Permission: This work is being carried out under NREGA as per Roll No.13 of Annexure-9 of the Government Circular dated 02.09.2020 of the Department of Planning (RoHo) at a cost of Rs. The estimated cost will be Rs 10,537. The details is as follows.
Page 9 of 19
# Page 10
Government Resolution No: MGRRO-2020/ P.No.70/ ROHYO-7
Unnecessary expenditure of Rs. 4,046/- (38%) Skilled Expenditure Rs. 6,491/- (62%) aggregating to Rs. 10,537/- (100% of the amount)
The amount of NADAP should be so much (at least 10 units) that on its basis only people will move towards prosperity by producing and selling organic manure.
However, this criterion is similar to the prevailing wage rate and DSR. Whenever there is a change in the rate of any one or both of these two, this estimated cost will change. The authority to approve that kind of change is being provided to the District Programme Coordinator/ District Programme Co-ordinator/ Commissioner, Magararohyo.
5. Maintaining 60:40 ratio: Under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), the unskilled ratio of the remaining work of construction of cattle shed, construction of goat shed and construction of poultry shed is 8:92, 9:91 and 10:90 respectively, except for the work of Bhoo-Sanjeevani NADEP composting. In this regard, the ratio of 60:40 (unskilled-skilled) of the districts will not be maintained due to these works. Therefore, in order to maintain the unskilled-skilled ratio while undertaking these works, the following other permissible works should be undertaken.
1) Individual tree plantation and rearing (3 years- 1 hectare) (any tree or a mixture of various trees) 2) Individual farmsteads- 15 X 15 X 3.00 3) Tree plantation on farm or bunds (Bihar pattern) 4) Absorption pits 5) Compost bunding
The above list is just an example. However, to maintain the ratio of 60:40, whatever work is suggested by the Gram Panchayat/ beneficiary and the system, all the works with higher wage ratio can be taken up. Similarly, one of the works of construction of cattle shed, goat rearing shed and cuckoo rearing shed should be sanctioned to one beneficiary and at each beneficiary level, an effort should be made to maintain an unskilled skill ratio of 60:40 through a combination of various works permissible under MGRROHYO. In exceptional cases, the ratio of 60:40 should be maintained by utilising the skilled expenditure from other personal or public works savings.
Page 19 of 10
# Page 11
Government Resolution No: MGRRO-2020/ P.No.70/ ROHYO-7
Similarly, the ratio of unskilled-skilled expenditure should be maintained at 60:40 by taking up private and public works in Gram Panchayats where the proportion of unskilled expenditure is high out of 275 individual and public works permissible under NREGA.
Employment of other labourers or assistance to the labour of the people: Combination of the various works permissible under the scheme for the prosperity of the family may lead to more than 100 days of work in a single year for a family. In such a situation, other labourers who are demanding other work in the village should be allowed to work in personal work.
If the number of labourers demanding work in the village is less, then other people should be requested to help by giving labour. Even if this work is considered as a shramdaan, it should be paid for the work, otherwise it will be difficult to maintain the ratio of 60:40.
6) Training: The objective of this scheme is to create a chain of prosperity through various schemes so that the farmer becomes a millionaire. The scheme mainly covers cattle shed, goat or sheep shed, poultry shed, etc. Training will be needed to develop attitudes to all these things.
Animal husbandry and animal husbandry are also important. There is a close relationship between animal health and fodder and animal feed. Therefore, along with the management of the herds, the health and proper care of the animals and the production of fodder and animal feed, training will have to be given to prepare different types of organic manure from the dung, hair and excreta of the cattle so that the dream of becoming a millionaire by moving towards prosperity by doing the supplementary business of animal husbandry along with organic farming can be realized.
Organic farming and organic farming can also produce organic and inorganic fertilizers and insect repellents from various plant and animal urine to improve soil health.
In which mainly lemon juice, dasaparni, arq lamita, etc are included.
In order to learn all these things together and by showing their videos on YouTube in the places where they adopt this method, training will be organized by government agencies and NGOs. This will range from change in perspective to promoting market and ancillary business.
The training curriculum will be prepared in such a combination. The entire process will be followed through the app.
7. Istanka: By doing the above works, 100% of the families of the village/ taluka/ district and the state are to be enriched. Special assistance will be provided by the Agriculture Department in this regard.

Government Resolution No: MGRRO-2020/ P.No.70/ ROHYO-7
Therefore, these departments should help the district and taluka administration by taking the initiative themselves. In the initial phase, at least one beneficiary should be identified in each village. This will be done through the app.
This Government decision is being issued with the approval of the Finance Department vide Informal Reference No. ANUS- 295/2020/ Expenditure-8 dated 04.12.2020.
