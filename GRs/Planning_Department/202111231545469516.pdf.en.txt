Introduction: The cases regarding land compensation under the State Employment Guarantee Scheme have been pending for many years and a large number of court cases and contempt petitions have been filed in this regard. The cases regarding the sanction of such land acquisition compensation are being submitted to the government very late, due to which the government has to bear a huge financial burden by increasing the interest liability on it. District-level meetings were also held in this regard. In the meeting, instructions have been given to take immediate action on all the pending cases and submit the funds to the government for approval. In addition, under the Semi-Government Letter dated 2.2.2021, instructions have been given to the concerned Collectors to prepare measures to clear 100% pending cases and develop an app by any district or two-four districts together. However, there is no expected cooperation/ action from any district in terms of reducing the number of pending cases. Under the old employment guarantee scheme, land was acquired for village ponds/ Pazar ponds 15-20 years ago and the government is incurring huge financial losses in terms of interest and other liabilities for its payment. As part of the measures to prevent further damage, it was contemplated to appoint a committee under the chairmanship of the Deputy Commissioner (ROHYO) to expeditiously dispose of the pending land acquisition cases. Following instructions are being issued now: Government Circular: A Committee under the Chairmanship of Deputy Commissioner (ROHYO) should be constituted to expeditiously dispose of the pending cases of land acquisition compensation under Employment Guarantee Scheme. The composition and functions of the Committee shall be as follows: 1) Deputy Commissioner (ROHYO) Chairman 2) Members to be selected by the concerned Sub Divisional Officer of the District (Deputy Commissioner (ROHYO) and Chairman of the Committee) 3) Members to be selected by the Land Acquisition Officer of Water Conservation/ Irrigation Department (Deputy Commissioner (ROHYO) and Chairman of the Committee) 4) Deputy Collector (ROHYO) of the concerned District- Member Secretary

The committee should hold a review meeting every 15 days to expedite the disposal of pending land acquisition compensation cases under the Employment Guarantee Scheme and in this meeting, the priority of the old case should be determined and the list should be submitted to the government. A time bound programme should be prepared to dispose of all such pending cases by the end of July, 2022 for forwarding the same to the Government for sanction of funds. The committee will be responsible for preparing concrete/ complete proposals in accordance with the Land Acquisition Act and related government decisions, circulars and court orders and submit cases within a time-bound period. If the cases remain pending after this or if the proposal is submitted after July 31, 2022, the committee should take action to recover the amount of interest in the prescribed manner by fixing the responsibility on the concerned officers/ employees responsible for such delay.
