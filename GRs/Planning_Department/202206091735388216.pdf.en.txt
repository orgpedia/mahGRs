the prelude
The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) aims at providing basic amenities and income to the needy households in rural areas by creating permanent employment opportunities through individual and public works. Therefore, it is necessary to think over what to create mats, and for this the goal must be clear.
Under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), 100% of the wages for 100 days are provided by the Central Government, 75% of the skilled and material is provided by the Central Government and 25% of the cost is borne by the State Government. So, the Centre-state ratio is 90:10. Under the scheme, 60% of the expenditure is expected to be on agriculture and allied activities, 65% on natural resource management and 60% on personal benefits. Also, 50% of the work is expected to be implemented through the Gram Panchayat. However, today about 80% of the work is done through the Gram Panchayat. The state government will also bear the burden of 100 days of wages.
The MNREGA department of the state seems to have only put forward the goal of providing employment till date. However, at present, other states such as Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh see MNREGA as a development scheme. In recent times, it has become clear that the objective of this scheme is not only to provide employment but also to remove poverty by raising the standard of living of the people in rural areas.
4. With the combination of various schemes of Magararohyo, every farmer can become rich (Lakhpati) if personal and public matters are given. For this, all the eligible families of the village will be selected and they will have to give the work of farms, gota, nadep and sukh khadda together. He will lead that village and all the families of that village towards prosperity. Farmers will prosper. Only then will the objectives of the Government Circular dated 02.09.2020 of the Department of Planning (ROHYO), namely" I am prosperous and my village is prosperous" and" Village is prosperous and my Maharashtra is prosperous" be achieved.
5. Similarly, the landless agricultural labourers will also be benefitted from the combination and if they are given proper training, they will become rich by selling milk, dung, urine, goat rearing, meat, vermicompost, organic manure etc. In this way, the way to wealth can be opened for everyone, be it farmers or landless agricultural laborers.

Using the guarantee scheme plays a big role in the constructive work of development. While implementing this scheme, the states of South India have made some important structural changes.
such as, for example,
In order to make more funds available from the Centre under the Employment Guarantee Act, the States make various arrangements at their level such as if the skilled cost of a work is more, the more skilled cost is borne by Andhra Pradesh.
2. Tamil Nadu increases the wage rate under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) as the wage is less than the market rate.
The States of Telangana, Karnataka and Kerala converge the schemes taken under MGNREGA with the departments of the States so that maximum funds can be made available by the Central Government.
The Central Government has notified the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), 2005 under Schedule 1 to Paragraph No. As per the policy, convergence of schemes of various departments with Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) has been decided. This convergence strategy will enhance the quality and productivity of various commodities produced through convergence with other departmental schemes under Mahatma Gandhi NREGA. Section 6 of Schedule 1 states the following:
"The State Government shall take concrete steps to achieve effective inter-departmental convergence till the last mile implementation level of the works under the Scheme with other Government Scheme / program so as to improve the quality and productivity of assets, and bring in synergy to holistically address the multiple dimensions of poverty in a sustainable manner."
9. In pursuance of the above, it has been decided to converge all the 262 works to be taken up under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) through a Government Resolution dated 30/03/2021 of the Planning Department. As per the provisions of the said decision, construction of guard wall for school/ playground, market shed with roof, school kitchen shelter, construction of drain-hole, godown/ onion chawl on public and group land, cold storage, cement road, paving block road, asphalt road, chain fencing for school/ playground, construction of anganwadi, gram panchayat building, community fish ponds, construction of concrete drains in public places, RCC main drainage system, underground bund, cement drain bund, composite gabion bund, construction of community shed, NADEP compost, etc. This will lead to a huge increase in the demand for work in the coming times, as well as a huge increase in skilled expenditure.
For example, if you take the work of a cement road through the circulation, then 3 m. width and 100 meters. Total Rs. It costs Rs 3,78,436. Under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), Rs. 95,637/- and 81,225/- for skilled expenditure, totalling Rs. 1,76,862/- and the remaining expenditure from other schemes (District Development Planning Committee, Fourteenth Finance Commission, various works of the Basic Scheme suggested by the people's representatives (under head 2515), Vasantrao Naik Tanda Vasti Yojana, schemes of basic development implemented by the Minority Department, MLA Page 3 of 6

Fund, MP Fund, etc.) Rs. It costs Rs 2,01,574. Then the Gram Panchayat can be linked to the various development schemes and the scope of the employment guarantee scheme can be increased at the village level.
The State Cabinet has approved the implementation of the Sharad Pawar Gram Samriddhi Yojana by taking up a combination of various schemes under the Department of Employment Guarantee Scheme.
Beneficiaries of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS). Minister of State, Maharashtra As suggested by the Members of the Legislative Assembly and other public representatives from time to time, it will be easier to make the beneficiaries rich from the poverty level if they are given benefits in the form of a package under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme in coordination with various departments.
11. As goats/ sheep are distributed under the Department of Animal Husbandry, if the goat rearing sheds are provided to the beneficiaries under the Employment Guarantee Scheme, such farmers will get a double benefit and their meat milk production will increase and goats and sheep will also get protection.
Under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, an irrigation well is provided for agriculture, but in many places, due to lack of electricity connection, the farmers can be coordinated with the Department of Energy to provide electricity connection or solar pump motor for the farmers who are unable to use water for agriculture.
Under the Employment Guarantee Scheme, subsidy is provided for farmlands, if the state fisheries department is coordinated, it will be easy for farmers to increase production by giving fish seeds and bringing them into the fish industry, and this will eradicate poverty.
4. If a beneficiary is given a fruit orchard plantation under the Magararohyo scheme, it will be appropriate for the Agriculture Department to approve the drip irrigation scheme for such beneficiary. Also, there should be coordination between the Department of Agriculture for the export of such fruits and the establishment of cold storage warehouses through the Warehousing Corporation.
The Women and Child Development Department provides a grant of Rs 8 lakh for an anganwadi. However, if the Anganwadi is taken up under the scheme, then Rs 4 lakh will be given from the Anganwadi and Rs 4 lakh will be given by the Women and Child Development Department. That is, double anganwadis will be built with the same funds of the Women and Child Development Department.
Families with malnourished children can be trained to have a balanced diet by providing them with adequate food grains, nutritious food by involving them in MGNREGA activities.
In this way, if the beneficiaries, labourers and farmers working under the MNREGA scheme can be given the benefits of the schemes of that department in coordination with different departments, it will be possible to raise the living standards of such beneficiaries in a short time and make them rich and eradicate poverty. For this purpose, a task force of Secretaries/ Principal Secretaries/ Additional Chief Secretaries of the departments implementing the various schemes will be formed.
