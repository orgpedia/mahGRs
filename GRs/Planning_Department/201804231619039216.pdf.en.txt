Guarantee Act, 2005 2. The MGNREGA (Amendment) Act, 2006 3. G. Mgraro-2017/ No.52/ Mgraro-1D. July 25, 2017
The Proposal:
The Employment Guarantee Act, 1977 (since amended in 2006) has come into force in the State of Maharashtra. The scheme is being implemented under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS). To authorize the Gram Panchayat to not issue e-muster on the work of this scheme as per the prevailing practice and to take action to issue e-muster at the Gram Panchayat level itself. For this, the process of capacity building of Gram Panchayats and issuing e-misters through our government portal has been adopted on a pilot basis in one district of Nagpur and Amravati division. Therefore, if this procedure is adopted in Maharashtra, the delay in delivering the muster to the Panchayat Samiti office for data entry can be avoided and more facilities can be added to the e-muster computer in the future.
At present, there is no separate computer facility for the work of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme at the gram panchayat level. Our government centers are working for computerization in every Gram Panchayat. Through this, e-muster is being issued from the Gram Panchayat level with the help of Gram Rozgar Sevaks. It was under consideration of the Government to fix the rate of service charge for the above work for one issued muster. The government has taken the following decisions:
Government's decision:
Under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, unskilled wages are to be paid to workers within 15 days of the closure of their employment. Facilitate the office system while providing wages to the workers within the stipulated time and similarly, the scheme will be implemented.
