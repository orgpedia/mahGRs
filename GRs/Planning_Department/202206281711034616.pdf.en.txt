Introduction: The Maharashtra Employment Guarantee Act was implemented in the state of Maharashtra since 1977.
Two schemes were introduced in the state under the Maharashtra Employment Guarantee Act 1977.
Employment Guarantee Scheme for Unskilled Persons in Rural Areas (2) Scheme of Personal Benefits as per Section 7 (2) of the Maharashtra Employment Guarantee Act, 1977 In the year 2005, the Central Government implemented the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme) throughout India. The Centre had also allowed the states, which had already passed the Employment Guarantee Act, to implement their laws under Section 28 of the Central Government Act. Accordingly, the Government of Maharashtra has taken the option of keeping the earlier law in 2006. Accordingly, the Legislature made necessary amendments in the 1977 Act to enable the State to get more funds in accordance with the Central Act, which has brought about a paradigm shift in the way the scheme is implemented.
At present, the Maharashtra Employment Act, 1977 (as amended upto 06.08.2014) is in force in the State and the following 2 schemes are being implemented under the Act: (a) Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) Under this scheme, the Central Government provides funds for 100 days of guaranteed employment per family and for 75% of the cost of unskilled labour and skilled material per family up to 100 days.
The State Government provides funds for the cost of unskilled labour beyond 100 days and 25% of the cost of skilled material.
b) State Employment Guarantee Scheme The State scheme is being implemented as a reimbursement scheme on the basis of the grant of personal benefit scheme as per section (7) (10) of the Maharashtra Employment Guarantee Act, 1977.
