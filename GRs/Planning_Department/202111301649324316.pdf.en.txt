Preamble: The Gram Panchayat is to act as an implementing agency under the Maharashtra Employment Guarantee Act, 1977 and the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005. For this purpose, the Gram Panchayat has to prepare a Samriddhi (Labour) Budget every year with the approval of the Gram Sabha. In this process, the participation of citizens from villages other than the panchayat headquarters is less in the panchayats with group gram panchayats. As a result, the needs are not being adequately addressed.
As per Section 3.1 of the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, the gram sabha, consisting of all the voters of the non-gram panchayat revenue village, tola, pada, tanda, has been legalized as a gram sabha. More than 5000 villages in the state have received collective forest rights. These collective forest rights recognized Gram Sabhas have to protect their collective forest rights area and water resources under Clause 5 of the Act and create a resource based order. Plantation of nurseries, afforestation, dams, ponds, agricultural dams and other related works will increase the underground and underground water reserves, increase agricultural income and forest produce. This will provide employment to tribals and other forest-dwelling people and will lead to their economic development. For this, every village, taluka, pada has to prepare a conservation and development plan for their area.
If village, tola, pada are planned as components in a decentralized manner, it will have a good and definite effect and the citizens of the village will participate in it. Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act
