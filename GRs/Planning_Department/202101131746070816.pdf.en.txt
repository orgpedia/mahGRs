The new administration building, 16th floor,

Date: January 13, 2021.
The Proposal:
Under the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, various types of works are carried out
1 Soil and Water Conservation 2 Tree plantation 3 Waste Water and Solid Waste Management 4 Personal Benefit Schemes 5 Convergence and Infrastructure Development
It will be possible to implement this scheme very effectively if the non-governmental organizations associated with the above works are included in its implementation. On soil and water conservation, help can be taken from organizations like Pani Foundation and Water. There are Sahyadri Devrai and Vanrai institutions in Bihar pattern and tree conservation. Also, there are a large number of farmers' groups (FPOs) engaged in organic farming. Also, many organizations work on the basis of livelihood. Some organizations work only on the basis of awareness. The state of Maharashtra has a long tradition of voluntary organizations. In recent times, many companies have come up with CSR-like arrangements through their own NGOs.
Or work on all topics with the help of other charitable organizations. Non-implementation of NREGA
The experience of these institutions in working at the ground level and the ability to garner public support will be useful to the administration. This will increase the participation of people in the scheme and improve the quality of life of the people by implementing the scheme effectively.
While doing all these things, the more the participation of the people, the more the village will get a boost to prosperous thinking. The society and the government must work together. In Satara district, work is being done on a large scale with the Pani Foundation. Chikhaldara and Amarnath taluks have taken the help of Pani Foundation for various purposes. The Water Foundation in the State

It works in 1,000 villages. Work with the water foundation is from both sides. They work on their own, they take the administration along and the administration is seen taking the help of Paani Foundation.
The administration, panchayats and NGOs across the state need to work in unison in this manner. In Hingoli district, the idea of both village prosperity and rejuvenation of the Kayadhoo river is being seen as a combination of various NGOs under the leadership of the district administration and the organisation UGAM. Also, some organizations are helping the Gram Panchayats in preparing the labour budget, planning the works and their proper quality implementation. Pragati Mission, Nashik has been producing and distributing IEC materials and training for the last several years.
Many organizations in the state are working on various levels like sarpanch training, farmer training, awareness awareness, etc. A letter with 8 videos has been issued on 29th October 2020 to spread the idea of' I am prosperous, village is prosperous and village is prosperous' and alternatively' My Maharashtra is prosperous' among the people by showing the videos of the success stories of various villages, farmers and entrepreneurs in the state and outside the state. These videos are expected to be shown to every citizen in rural areas of the state.
For all these and other works, it is possible to give more impetus to the work by entering into partnership agreements with the NGOs working in your district.
A study of the Magrarohyo Law and the Master Circulars shows that the Magrarohyo are to be observed/ listened to. A few examples of these are as follows.
Schedule (1) of the MGNREGA Act provides for a well-planned, participatory planning at each stage of the panchayat during the month of August to September, in accordance with the procedures prescribed by the State Government. The Gram Panchayat shall determine the works to be taken up by the Gram Panchayat and shall place the same before the Gram Sabha for approval after mentioning the outcome of each work as may be required.
As per the provisions of paragraph 13 (c) Schedule 1, every proposed work to be taken up under MGNREGA shall be accompanied by a technical note on the design and the expected outcome of the proposed work.
According to the provisions of Chapter 7.1.5 of the Master Circular, if the result/ benefit of a work is obtained by doing it in a group form, then the work is divided into small-form work.

should not be done. such as 10. I want to dig a long tunnel
The work should be done in a single budget and it should not be broken into pieces by making a budget in a piecemeal manner.
As per the provisions of Chapter 7.12.2 of the Master Circular, the productivity of the work/ output should be regulated by the Gram Sabha before approving any work considering the expected productivity/ output of the work. All such works approved by the Gram Sabha should not be stopped without measuring the productivity/ effectiveness of the work.
The State Government will schedule training sessions to guide all Government agencies on the expected outcomes of each work and train them on its utilization.
Logframe analysis of the performance and productivity of the selected works taken up from MGRHOIO is also given in Annexure-A.
Keeping this in mind, in recent times, the government has been emphasizing on strengthening the concept of prosperity through entrepreneurship. Examples include this year's Labor Budget Circular (August 5, 2020),
These are: Information, Awareness and Trainings (September 2, 2020) Sharad Pawar Gram Samriddhi Yojana (December 18, 2020) and Guardian Minister Panand Rasto (February 27, 2018). Below are some of the highlights.

Organization of the Prosperity Campaign: Every year from 26 January (Republic Day) to 30 January (Martyrs' Day), the Prosperity Campaign should be implemented with the help of all voluntary organizations with the following slogan: The slogan will remain the same across the state this year. However, this may change every year. Similarly, each district/ taluka can also run a campaign on similar themes in different weeks.
""" If I am prosperous, my village is prosperous."""
9. Evaluation: A large number of development works are being carried out in rural areas through schemes like MGNREGA and many other schemes. They are successful every year. However, the results of those works are not adequately evaluated every year. 275 types of work can be done from Mgrarohiyo. Also, the additional funds are used for development works by working through the convergence of other schemes of the state. Therefore, the State Planning Department (ROHYO) is preparing a benchmark for self-assessment of the process and outcome of development works of each village/ gram panchayat.
