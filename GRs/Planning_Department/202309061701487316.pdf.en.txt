6.I letter from MGNREGA Nagpur No. Commissionerate/ Agriculture/ 1861/2023 D. 10.5.2023 Preamble- As per the decision of the Government of Reference No. 1, mulberry cultivation was started on a pilot basis in Beed, Jalna and Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar districts. There, farmers responded to mulberry cultivation by planting more than one and a half times the given target. After this, it was decided to implement the mulberry plantation program in Nagpur and Wardha districts as per the government decision of reference number 2 and in the entire state as per the government decision of reference number 3.
Last year, it was Rs 250 to Rs 900 per kg. From this it can be seen that there is a huge fluctuation in the fund rate. The farmers participating in the silk industry should enter this sector only after studying in depth the dangers in the market. Also learn the techniques of insect breeding. At present, there has also been an increase in the rate of wages, which is more beneficial if the person of the household is in these industries. One good thing about mulberry cultivation is that mulberry is also useful for milch animals and rearing captive goats. The protein content in the pulp of mulberry is about 25%. Therefore, the fat of the milk also increases, not only will the new animals eat in the beginning, but they will also get used to eating mulberry in the beginning if mulberry is given with other grass or other fodder, and once the habit is formed, there is no need to give any other fodder. Suppose if the branch is thick then the animal eats the bark of that branch also. If mulberry is grown as a fodder crop, then it will take about three months to get the first cutting, then every 45 to 60 days a good mulberry can be obtained. Also silkworm vista can be given to the animals as a nutritious food. Initially, the vista of the insects should be collected from the rearing house and dried in the air, then before giving to the cattle, clean water should be used.

Add a little salt or pepper and the rice flour. After tasting the taste, the cattle eat the whole mixture with interest, which also helps to reduce the cost of animal feed and increase the fat content of the milk.
So far, about 15,000 acres of mulberry has been planted in the state and there is a huge demand at the regional level. Despite good demand for silk industry at the regional level and availability of funds from the central government, the scheme is not being implemented in the state to the desired extent. The main reason for this is the lack of field establishment in the Silk Directorate. The government is taking the following decisions to implement the Silk Industry Development Scheme through the Directorate of Silk, the Department of Agriculture and the Panchayat Department in accordance with the demand received from the field level.
The government has decided to implement the Silk Industry Development Scheme under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) in the entire state through the Department of Agriculture and the Panchayat Department along with the Silk Factory.

Target of the scheme: The target of mulberry cultivation in the state is being set at one lakh acres (40,000 hectares) in the next five years. Looking at the success rate of silk industry in different districts, the targets of different districts should be decided by the Silk Directorate by looking at the performance of the districts without targeting all the districts equally.
