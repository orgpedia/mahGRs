Since the funds for the Hill Development Programme have not been increased since 2011-12 and the funds required for permissible works are insufficient in view of the increase in the cost of raw materials, labour etc., the Government has been receiving repeated requests from the people's representatives to increase the funds for the Hill Development Programme.
