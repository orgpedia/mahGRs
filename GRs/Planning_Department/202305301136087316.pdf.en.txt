The Proposal:
The government has taken a decision based on the convergence of schemes of MGNREGA and other departments. As per 14/12/2022, it has been decided to implement the schemes of Suvidha Kutumb and Sarvottam Gram Samudhi Yojana on mission mode basis. Therefore, the amount of work under MNREGA in the state is increasing and it is expected that there will be an increase in these works in the future.
MGNREGA is being implemented in rural areas of the state and the Gram Panchayat has been made the last component.
The group of villages under the Gram Panchayat are in the same way Wadi, Wasti, Tande are in the scattered form.
Therefore, to provide work to the labourers under the Gram Panchayat within the prescribed time as per the demand, to plan the work, to implement the scheme, as well as to have direct control over the distribution of wages and the creation of a productive permanent base.
There is definitely a need for manpower. Similarly, the Gram Rozgar Sevaks will have to register the attendance of the labourers on the new NMMS app in accordance with the wages of the labourers in a new transparent manner. Adequate manpower is required at the field level to implement these and similar transparent issues in a time bound and strict manner.
Under MGNREGA, on an average, a Gram Rozgar Sevak can get a remuneration of Rs 30,000 even if he completes the work of a well in a year. MNREGA is being implemented in the state under various schemes, including providing 90 to 100 skilled days of guaranteed employment per household. These man days are also calculated to pay the honorarium to the Gram Rozgar Sevak, considering all these things, it is also proved that the Gram Rozgar Sevak gets the honorarium in the amount of work he does. In doing so, after the presence of a certain number of workers, additional workload is definitely created. This is the thing

GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: MGRRO 2023/ PR No. 94/ ROHYO-10A
Considering this, the appointment of an additional village employment servant seems to be mandatory. The government had to take a decision in this regard.
Government's decision:
There has been a tremendous increase in the amount of work under MGNREGA and the available Gram Rozgar Sevak has definitely increased the workload in accordance with the above-mentioned measures within the prescribed time. In view of this, how to make available additional Gram Rozgar Sevak in all the Gram Panchayats of the state? A policy is being drafted in this regard. However, at present, such additional village employment is being provided in some Gram Panchayats on a pilot basis.
It is being repeatedly communicated from the field level that the servant should be appointed. In view of this fact, the Gram Panchayats in the state where a large number of works are implemented and the demand for laborers is high, such Gram Panchayats are in group Gram Panchayat/ scattered form. These include villages, hamlets and hamlets. Such Gram Panchayats will also try to implement the scheme in their Gram Panchayats.
Couldn't. In such Gram Panchayats every year (less than 1000 man-days), the impact will definitely be felt by giving adequate publicity to the scheme, as well as providing additional manpower to provide work to the laborers on demand. In view of this, approval is being given to provide additional Gram Rozgar Sevaks in some Gram Panchayats.
Thus, the man-days generated by the respective manpower while making available additional Gram Rozgar Sevak will be the only component admissible for payment of honorarium. No additional fee is to be paid. The number of man-days created for Gram Rozgar Sevaks and Additional Gram Rozgar Sevaks should be calculated separately. But it's a collective thing. Such matters should be effectively handled by both the Grama Rozgar Sevaks jointly. Thus, while making available additional Gram Rozgar Sewak, women are given priority.
Village employment officer should be appointed. Priority should also be given to women working in Umeed, Prerak, Krishi Sakhi, Pashu Sakhi, non-governmental organizations working in the field of soil conservation. Age Limit, Educational Qualification for Additional Village Employment Servants
The appointment of these original village employment servants will remain in accordance with the original government decision.
