Cleaning paper:
As per the Government Decision dated 27th May, 2011, the role and responsibilities of other agencies have been fixed for carrying out various activities of MGNREGA. As per Annexure A, in the Annexure 9 and 10 of the said Government Decision, the responsibility of providing facilities to the labourers at the work place and taking daily attendance of the labourers and other records etc. is on the field technical cadre of the concerned machinery and the concerned Gram Sevak.
2. The Gram Sevaks are required to perform various tasks by the Gram Sevak Association through their representations. In this, due to the work of the Election Commission/ the work of the Agriculture Department/ the Social Justice Department, the village servant is not able to do justice to a very comprehensive scheme like MNREGA due to the extra stress and mental stress on the village servant. Therefore, the demand to implement a separate system for this was coming to the government from time to time from the Gram Sevak Association. The meeting was chaired by the Minister. Based on the discussion in this meeting, the government has taken the following decision considering the demand of the Gram Sevak Association.
54/ ROHYO-10-A, dated 27th May, 2011 is being amended to omit the word Gram Sevak (Gram Sevak) in Annexure A at No.9 and to read instead," Gram Rozgar Sevak (Gram Sevak) shall register the attendance of the labourers at the table in Table 10 and shall verify/ verify the same by the Technical Cadre (Gram Sevak) of the concerned machinery."
