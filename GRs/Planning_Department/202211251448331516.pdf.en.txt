Circular:
As per the above decision of the Planning (Rohyo Ward) Department dated 11th November, 2021, the" Matoshree Gram Samruddhi Khet/ Panand Road Scheme" has been started for the work of farm/ Panand roads by formalizing the Guardian Farm/ Panand Road Scheme. In view of the large requirement of farm/ waterways roads, the Government have approved the provision of additional skilled funds through convergence of MGNREGS and State ROHAs to mobilize more funds from MNREGA for such farm/ waterways works.
Accordingly, the plans for farm/ waterway roads are being approved at the government level.
1 km as per the sample budget in the government decision dated November 11, 2021.
The road is estimated to cost Rs. 23.84 crore. Of this, Rs. 9,02,879/- for skilled component of MGNREGA to the extent of Rs. 6,01,919/- and Rs. 8,80,058/- (Rs. 23,84,856/- has been budgeted. The budget also includes royalty and Goods and Services Tax (GST). It has been stated in the above decision dated 11/11/2021 that the amount of budget may vary due to local geographical conditions and district-wise changes. However, due to lack of gravel and mud required for graveling and the consequent increase in the transport lead, as well as the cross drainage work required to be done on farm/ watery roads, etc., the actual construction of farm/ watery roads has seen a substantial increase in the amount of budgets if the site-wise budgets are prepared. Especially in km.
There is a huge difference in the budget of agricultural/ irrigation roads from district to district. Also, the quality of the work needs to be maintained as there are difficulties while carrying out the actual work of farm/ waterlogged roads. However, in order to ensure that the State does not have to bear the undue burden of supplementary skilled funds, it has been informed earlier that the budget for the farm/ waterway roads where the ad-valorem amount exceeds Rs.24 lakh per km shall be submitted at the Government level with technical approval.
