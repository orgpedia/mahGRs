Under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), the work plan for the next financial year (April 1 to March 31) has to be finalised by December 31 this financial year. The procedure and schedule in this regard are mentioned in Annexure-I of the Government Resolution No.Magrohyo-2006/ PR.No.104/ Rohyo-10 dated 19th October, 2006 on the Planning (ROHYO) Department at Roll No.1 in the above context.
However, in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, several restrictions have been imposed in the state to prevent the spread of the disease. In view of this, it is impossible to make information about the work available to the people of the village as mentioned in the Government Decision and Circular dated 19 October 2006, 5 August 2020 and 2 September 2020, to approve the work plan by holding the Gram Sabha, to get administrative approval of the Panchayat Committee, to send the Panchayat Committee to the District Program Coordinator with the planning of the Taluk, to send the planning program approved by the Joint District Program Coordinator with the Panchayat Committee of all the Talukas to the District Coordinator, to get the approval of the District Council both in planning (Gram Panchayat) and planning (other mechanisms) with the help of the District Program Coordinator, etc.
The quorum required for a meeting of Gram Sabha is 25% of the total number of members or 100 whichever is less, as specified in Chapter II, Section 9 (3) of the Maharashtra Gram Panchayat Act, 1959 (III of 1959) (as amended in 2014). In the wake of COVID-19, instructions have already been issued to the concerned to hold such meetings through mobile apps like Zoom, Google etc. by meeting the social distancing norms.
Accordingly, the budget approved in the Gram Sabha meeting has to be approved by the District Council. However, in the wake of COVID-19, the Annual General Meeting of the Zila Parishad has not been held yet and it is unlikely that it will be held in the next one or two months.
In view of this, the government was considering to approve the budget passed by the Gram Sabha as a special case.
Government Circular: In view of the large number of migrant labourers in the rural areas of the state in the wake of COVID-19, how to provide them work on a large scale and how to double the income of the farmers by 2022, each Gram Panchayat and the constituent villages of that Gram Panchayat will prosper, the Supplementary Labour Budget for 2020-21 and the Annual Action Plan for 2021-22
