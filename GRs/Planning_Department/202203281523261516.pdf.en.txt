Mantralaya, Mumbai- 400 032
Date of release: March 28, 2022
The urbanization rate in the state of Maharashtra is 45.23%. Due to large scale urbanization, these Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) require large amount of funds to provide civic services and facilities in accordance with the statutory duties and responsibilities of (i) 27 Municipal Corporations and (ii) 381 Municipalities. Though urban local bodies get funds through various state-level schemes and centrally sponsored schemes implemented by the Urban Development Department, these funds are insufficient to meet the specific needs of the districts in the face of large-scale urbanisation. Also, as the urban general population of the district is currently not considered in the prevalent formula of allocation of funds under the District Annual Plan (General), the availability of funds required for providing civic services and facilities to the urban local bodies is limited. Considering this, the need to revise this formula was felt during the formulation of the District Annual Plan 2022-23 and in the Budget 2022-23, special additional budget was provided to the District Planning Committee for urban areas.
The United Nations General Assembly adopted 17 Sustainable Development Goals in 2015. The 17 Sustainable Development Goals. The 11th development goal is to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. The United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) through its The New Urban Agenda has provided a clear roadmap to achieve these Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at a faster pace. In line with the Sustainable Development Goals, the State has prepared a publication' Vision 2030' which covers urban development with the objectives of i) Developing well planned cities, ii) Providing minimum level of water supply, sanitation and civic infrastructure, iii) Making urban and urban communities-smart by 2030, iv) Making cities green and liveable and v) Making cities friendly to elderly, children and persons with disabilities.
Accordingly, it was for the consideration of the Government to provide funds through the Planning Department on the lines of the funds provided to the Urban Local Bodies through the Urban Development Department.
