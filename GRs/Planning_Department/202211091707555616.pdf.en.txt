NITI Aayog, Government of India, has released the Multi-Dimensional Poverty Index (MDPI) in September 2021. Maharashtra's poverty rate is 14.9 per cent, which is 21 times that of Kerala (0.71 per cent). This is not good for a progressive country like ours.
Accordingly, the number of poor people district-wise has been calculated on the basis of the population of districts X poverty percentage of district divided by 100. (The percentage of poor in different districts of the State is given in Annexure 1) For the first time, poverty has been declared in a multi-dimensional manner in the country. The three dimensions of deprivation are defined as health, education and living standards. Each of these dimensions is given a coefficient of one third.
In the future, the work of MGNREGA will be to strike at this dimension of deprivation. A detailed analysis of the tasks required to hit the various Aryans of deprivation and how it is possible through MGNREGA is given in Annexure-II.
Average number of families in a district is 4.
4
That will be it.
The government has issued orders to provide job cards to each of these families.
Also, each of these job cards will be required to work for at least 100 days per year under MGNREGA.
Accordingly, district-wise number of person days per district= number of poor families in the district x 100 from the remaining period of 2022-23 till the end of poverty.
The District Programme Coordinator should declare the annual target of each Taluk and Gram Panchayat in the next 15 days according to this formula. This indicator should be determined by assuming that the percentage of remote poverty is the same in all districts. However, if a District Programme Coordinator feels that the poverty percentage is higher in some talukas of the district, then the poverty percentage of those talukas should be decided by the District Level Committee accordingly. The poverty rate should be considered the same for all gram panchayats within a taluk. The District Information System Coordinator should assist in this task of Estimates.
Accordingly, the Gram Panchayat-wise targets should be communicated to the State Government and a copy of the same should be given to the Commissioner MNREGA, Nagpur.
