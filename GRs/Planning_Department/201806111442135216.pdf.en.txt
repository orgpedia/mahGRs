GOVERNMENT Circular: 1. Financial limit for grant of administrative approval for construction of new residential, office and other buildings by the Committee of Secretaries is Rs. 5.00 crore to Rs. 15.00 crore.
The Secretary Committee has only Rs. Since proposals for new residential, office and other buildings above Rs. 15.00 crore are to be submitted henceforth, the concerned administrative departments should ensure that the Thin Spreading of Financial Resources is not caused by the fixed costs and liabilities available to them in the relevant financial year and the construction undertaken should be completed first from the available provision. In order to determine the extent of spread of financial resources, the administrative departments should consider the total cost ceiling based on the following formula while granting administrative approval to the construction proposals of new residential, office and other buildings in a particular financial year:
(a) the average of the financial provisions made in the last three years under the head of accounts under which the administrative approval is to be given.
(b) the balance cost of works in progress+ administrative sanction
(a)- (b)= a
(d) Total cost ceiling for administrative approval of new works in the current financial year= CÃ— 1.5
(e) Subject to the maximum limit of d above:
1) Rs. Every work above the cost of Rs. 15.00 crore will require approval of the Committee of Secretaries headed by the Chief Secretary.
2) Rs. The concerned Administrative Department will have the power to approve each of the following works worth Rs. 15.00 crore.
The Committee of Secretaries will review the Thin Spreading of Financial Resources available with the Administrative Department in the financial year and the liabilities received. If it is found that the administrative department is spreading financial resources on the basis of available budget and liabilities, then appropriate restrictions will be imposed by the Committee of Secretaries to maintain financial discipline.
(4) Considering the total number of proposals to be submitted by the concerned Administrative Department before the Committee of Secretaries, the total cost of construction of residential, office and other buildings is Rs. The Department of Public Works should hold one meeting of the Committee of Secretaries every month to expedite the administrative approval of proposals worth more than Rs. 15.00 crore.
