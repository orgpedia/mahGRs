GOVERNMENT DECISIONS:- In the Government Circular dated 01.12.2020, read with the above, the work of Wall Compound for School/ Anganwadi has already been included along with other works. However, this instruction has been issued only for Zilla Parishad Schools/ Anganwadis. As the Hon'ble Cabinet in its meeting dated 13/06/2023 has directed to construct protective walls around all schools under MGNREGA, this includes schools of Social Justice and Special Assistance Department, Schools of Other Backward Classes and Adivasi Development Department, Schools of Minority Development Department and aided/ unaided schools of the said departments. However, while taking up the work of retaining wall of these schools, the work of retaining wall for ZP schools and Anganwadis will be taken up on priority, followed by other government schools, government aided schools and unaided schools.
The Ministry of Rural Development has directed that the ratio of expenditure on wages (unskilled) and material (skilled) for works done under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) should be 60:40 at the district level. Since the expenditure on protective wall works is mainly material expenditure, there are limitations in completing these works under MNREGA. However, while carrying out the work of retaining walls around the schools under MNREGA, the ratio of unskilled and skilled expenditure in MNREGA will be maintained at 60:40 respectively.
In schools/ anganwadis where labour-intensive works are possible to be carried out under MNREGA, the total ratio of unskilled and skilled expenditure on construction of retaining wall and other labour-intensive permissible works (such as tree plantation, levelling of grounds or others) for schools under MNREGA should be maintained at 60:40. In this way, schools do not have to follow the priorities while doing the work of guard wall under MGNREGA as mentioned above while taking action on unskilled and skilled expenditure.
In the case of schools/ anganwadis where labour-intensive works under MNREGA are not possible, the ratio of unskilled and skilled expenditure on construction of retaining walls for schools under MNREGA by taking up plantation/ plantation or other labour-intensive (unskilled) works on the farm/ fallow land of eligible students/ staff of the school should be maintained at 60:40 respectively. In this way, the schools do not need to follow the main program while doing the guard wall work under MGNREGA as mentioned above while taking action on unskilled and skilled expenditure.
3) The work of retaining wall for schools can also be done by combining the various works permissible under MGNREGA at the Gram Panchayat level and the work of retaining wall for schools.
4) In Gram Panchayats, the work of retaining wall for school can be done within the limit of available additional skilled units or possible additional skilled units as per the actual expenditure on works under MNREGA.
5) Under MGNREGA, the work of retaining wall for the school is also done by providing supplementary skilled expenditure (Part-C) from the convergence of various funds available at the Gram Panchayat level such as Finance Commission Fund, funds available under PACE, MLA/ MP Development Fund, District Planning Committee Fund, Gram Panchayat Self-Fund, CSR and all Central/ State/ District level schemes under which the work of retaining wall for the school is permissible.

3. In Jalgaon district, a large number of works have been taken up under the convergence of protective wall work for schools under MGNREGA scheme. Accordingly, considering the budget of the protective wall work for the school under the MNREGA scheme in Jalgaon district, the office of the NREGA Commissioner, Nagpur has prepared a model budget for the work of 100 meters. This sample budget and the design of the work is annexed as Annexure A.

The process of preparing the budget, giving technical approval and administrative approval for the works of the protective wall for the school under MNREGA will be done at the field level as per the orders issued from time to time under the Government Order.
5. The process of preparing a proposal for the construction of a protective wall for the school under MNREGA and submitting it to the concerned Gram Panchayat will be done by the headmaster of the school.

These works will be started in the same financial year, for which the concerned headmaster/ gram sevak/ gram rozgar sevak will jointly follow up with the concerned officers/ employees.
