Maharashtra has been trying to make a radical change in the implementation of the MNREGA scheme for the last one and a half to two years. In this change, a view has been given to look at MNREGA as a development scheme and not just as a scheme to provide employment for manual labourers. So that the people of the state do not have to do manual labor in the future.
This change in approach has led to the concept of" I am prosperous, village is prosperous and village is prosperous and alternatively my Maharashtra is prosperous." At the same time, the idea of" every family is a lakhpati" is gaining ground, as a result of which the system under MGNREGA has to deal with a much greater number of personal benefit cases than before.
At present, almost all the people in the system are already working as per the habit of low capacity work at the initial place of posting, as the volume of work has increased, there is a demand to fill more posts from everywhere. Most people do not realize that in a truly changed situation, there is a need to increase work efficiency, as well as to change the previous bad work habits. To realise this changed scenario, the change of work location will help everyone to understand the new office, the people in the new office, the new villages and the new beneficiaries as well as the speed and efficiency of the changed work.

There are also complaints against some employees. Some of the complaints are serious in nature and some are due to poor relations with the people there. In case of serious complaints, there is a provision to remove the employees from service after investigation. If the complaint is not serious, however, if the complaint is true, there is no provision in the hands of the administration to take action against the concerned employees today.
For the above two reasons, the matter of formulating a transfer policy for employees appointed through the State Fund Association as well as from an external organization was under the consideration of the government. The government is formulating a policy as follows:
Government circular
1) Employees appointed by the State Fund Association as well as by external agencies will be transferred after more than five years in one place.
If a complaint is received against the employee and if the inquiry finds that the complaint is not serious in nature, then the employee can be transferred within five years.
3) These changes will be made in the nearest taluk or district. However, if this is not possible from the administrative point of view, then the transfer will be made anywhere in the state.
4) If some employees apply for transfer on the basis of their convenience, such requests will be transferred if there is a vacancy at the place of the request or if a new post is being created.
5) If political pressure or any other wrong means is brought to the transfer, action will be taken as per the rules of the government decision.
