Introduction: The price situation is of paramount importance in the state's economy. A variety of indicators are used to indicate changes in the price position in the state. The State-level Consumer Price Index for Rural and Urban areas is calculated by the Directorate of Statistics with the base year 2003 as the current series for the state of Maharashtra. When calculating the consumer price index by time scale, it is necessary to observe the base year and the VAT on the goods taken under it. Accordingly, the Consumer Price Index Series 2003 needs to be revised and the State level Consumer Price Index Series 2025 is being worked out by the Directorate of Finance and Statistics. For this, the government was considering setting up a state-level strategic advisory committee to work out the modalities for district and regional level consumer price index calculations and base year changes, etc. Accordingly, the government is taking the following decisions.
Government Decisions: 2. The State Level Technical Advisory Committee on Consumer Price Index is being constituted under the Consumer Price Index Series 2003 to revise and the State Level Consumer Price Index Series 2025 to determine the procedure for calculation of district and regional level Consumer Price Index and base year changes, etc.
