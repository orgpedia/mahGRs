Planning Department, Government Resolution No.DAP-1015/ PR No. 48/ K. 1481 dated 30/03/2015
The Proposal:
As per the decision of the Government dated 30/03/2015 of the Planning Department, the development areas under the District Annual Plan (General) have been divided into core and non-core areas.
Under the District Annual Plans, the funds sanctioned to the district are kept in the ratio of 2/3 for core area and 1/3 for non-core area. Under the District Annual Plan (General), grants are distributed to various sectors. The sector requires substantial funds to meet the basic needs of the common citizen. At present, power development and non-conventional energy development are non-core sectors and the scope and subsidy available to this sector is limited. The sector is also facing technical difficulties in providing funds. Due to the limited funds available with the Power Department, there are difficulties in the availability of infrastructure and maintenance repairs. The frequent power outages have led to a huge loss of agricultural production and income for farmers. Incorporating the power sector from the non-core sector to the core sector will provide more funds to the power sector and more of these funds can be used to strengthen the infrastructure of the power sector. Considering this, the government was considering to include the energy sector in the core sector of the district annual plan (general) instead of the non-core sector.
Government's decision:
The Government is approving inclusion of" Energy" in the Non-Garbh Area Development Sector under the District Annual Plan (General) in the" Garbh Area" instead of" Non-Garbh Area." Accordingly, the revised division of development areas under the District Annual Plan (General) will be as follows.
