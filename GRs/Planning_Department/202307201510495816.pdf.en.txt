This amount has been increased from time to time. The increase in funds has also led to an increase in the number of jobs.

Accordingly, for effective implementation and control of MP Local Area Development Scheme, a separate new cell at the state level and four posts for the same have been created on the establishment of Planning Department (itself) in the form of Provisional Reference No. 1 has been created by the decisions of the government. The government was contemplating to revamp these posts. Accordingly, reference No. 1 The government decisions here are being overridden and revised government decisions are being issued.
