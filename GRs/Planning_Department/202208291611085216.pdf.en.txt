Read:- Government Circular, Finance Division No: ARJA-2016/ PR No.84/ SEWA-6, dated 10.10.2017.
Circular:
The Finance Department has prescribed detailed instructions and procedures for taking action against Government employees who are unauthorisedly absent as per the Government Circular dated 10.10.2017.
Regarding leave of officers/ employees of the Planning Department (itself), it has been observed that officers/ employees go on long leave without sanctioning or sanctioning leave of short duration. They do not even inform their respective supervisory officers/ offices-1421 (Establishment) in writing or over phone about the leave. Also, it is often observed that officers/ staff have extraordinary leave due to non-availability of leave accounts. The salary will be paid in the following months.
However, for officers/ employees who are members of the National Pension Scheme (NPS), 10 per cent of the amount is deposited in the account of the National Pension Scheme (NPS) from the salary of the concerned and 14 per cent is deposited by the government. Officers/ employees who are members of the National Pension Scheme (NPS) are not able to recover 10% and 14% of the pension contribution amount deposited in the National Pension Scheme (NPS) account while recovering their salary as they have gone on long-term extraordinary leave without prior approval. While disbursing the salary of the officers/ employees who are members of the National Pension Scheme and do not have leave accounts, their National Pension Scheme (NPS) account cannot be withdrawn after deduction of 10% and 14% of their salary from the pension account of the respective pensioners.
Similar situation may be in the subordinate office of the planning department with a slight difference.

Therefore, it is informed to the officers/ staff of the Planning Department (itself) that before proceeding on long leave, the leave accounts are required to be sanctioned only after ensuring that adequate leave is available. In the event of leave not being sufficient and in case of leave and non-payment of salary, the entire responsibility will be of the concerned officer/ employee. Similarly, the head of the regional office under the planning department will also have to ensure.
Further, to curb the tendency of frequent absence/ unauthorised absence, the provisions of the Government Circular, Finance Division No: 2016/ No.84/ Service-6, dated 10.10.2017 should be scrupulously followed.
Also, the government order. The employees who are absent for more than 6 months in the pattern prescribed in the Planning Department (itself) and the Regional Office (excluding the employees who are on leave due to study leave, maternity leave, child care leave applicable to the employees with disabled children as per the Government decision dated 21.09.2016 of the Finance Department, tuberculosis, cancer etc.) should be reviewed and submitted to the Government in the first week of July of every year.
The Planning Department (itself) and the concerned Regional Offices are required to submit the aforesaid report by 30.09.2022. It should be ensured that the Sixth Annual Report is submitted regularly to the Finance Department through the Planning Department on 31st January and 31st July of every year.
The circular should be brought to the notice of all the officers/ employees of the department/ zonal office.
