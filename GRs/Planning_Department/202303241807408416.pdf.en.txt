A high-level committee of secretaries has declared 35 posts of Group-C (Drivers) cadre and 31 posts of Group-D (Multi-Purpose Workers) cadre dead in the regular posts on the establishment of Planning Department (itself) (including Rohyo Ward). As per the revised pattern, the existing vacancies of drivers and Group-D cadre should be filled up by external agencies. While availing services through external agencies, care should be taken to follow the guidelines in the Government Decision dated 27 th April, 2022 of the Department of Finance.
At present, the number of posts is more than the number of employees working in both Group-C (Drivers) Cadre 4 and Group-D. The posts will be automatically terminated after they fall vacant on account of retirement/ resignation/ death of the employee.
After the abolition of the number of posts, the services of these posts will be made available by external agencies as per the requirement within the sanctioned manpower limit.
