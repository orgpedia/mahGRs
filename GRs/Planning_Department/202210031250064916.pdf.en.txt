| All the people who need employment should be provided employment.                                                                            |
| The standard of living is also expected to improve.                                                                                          |
| On an average, 30 lakh to 35 lakh people get employment every year by providing employment to 50,000 to 60,000 people.                       |

| It is not possible to say whether you are an individual or a public sustainable and productive person in this taluka.                        |
| We have been successful in building it so that the overall development of this village could be possible.                                    |
| As we have started moving towards prosperous villages and prosperous Maharashtra, and farmers or                                             |
| The entire scheme has been given a new twist by considering the landless laborer family as the focal point.                                  |
| Now the objective of this scheme is to not only provide employment to the people but also to take them towards the path of prosperity        |
| We need to celebrate Prosperity Day every month.                                                                                             |

| With the aim of creating sustainable and productive work, people's living standards will improve.                                            |
| All the villagers should discuss about the development of the village on' Samriddhi Diwas" and make further plans.                           |
