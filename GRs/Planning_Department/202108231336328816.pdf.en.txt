Government Resolution No: Sthavika- 0521/ PR No. 53/ KA 1482
As per the existing guidelines of the MLA Local Development Programme, it is not permissible to provide any selected infrastructure and other facilities on the private land of the co-operative housing societies in the municipal corporations, municipalities and nagar panchayats as well as in the rural areas adjacent to these urban areas. But even though the lands of these cooperative housing societies are private, the demand is being received from the legislators to the state government to allow select infrastructure and other facilities under the MLA Local Development Program. In fact, the cooperative housing societies have a collective and legal obligation to undertake activities related to environment conservation and sustainable development in the form of solid waste management, water harvesting, solar energy utilization, etc. through various Acts/ Rules/ Regulations of the Central and State Governments in the rural areas falling under the Municipal Corporations and Municipalities and Nagar Panchayats and adjoining Local Bodies. However, in view of the need to create necessary administrative arrangements for sustainable development and to determine the modalities for providing financial incentives/ support, it may be permissible to use the funds under MLA Local Development Programme by amending/ modifying the existing guidelines of the MLA Local Development Programme and considering the strategies of various departments to achieve the goals and targets set under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 in a time-bound manner with the participation of Municipal Corporations and Municipalities and Municipalities and Cooperative Housing Societies in the rural areas adjoining the area. Accordingly, the above Committee shall submit its recommendations within two months after studying the amendments/ changes in the Guidelines.
