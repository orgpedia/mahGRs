Preamble: 2. Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme is being effectively implemented in the state. The effective implementation of the scheme is to be done on priority by the Panchayati Raj Institutions. At the zonal level, the responsibility of keeping records and records at the gram panchayat level lies with the sarpanch and gram sevaks, and their work is part-time as they are responsible for assisting and assisting in this work. The availability of Gram Rozgar Sevak to assist Gram Panchayats in these tasks has been made available through the respective Gram Sabha. Gram Rozgar Sevaks are expected to be paid remuneration in proportion to the work done under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. However, there has also been a follow-up of repeated representations from village employment servants regarding the fact that village employment servants receive meagre remuneration in places of low employment. A proposal was under consideration at the government level for them to receive a satisfactory regular remuneration. As per Planning (ROHYO) Department Government Circular No.Magraro-2023 / P.No.23 / ROHYO-7 dated 16th May, 2023, the consolidated remuneration was being paid per month in line with the total accumulated man-days generated under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme.
In view of all these factors, the government was considering revising the remuneration given to Gram Rozgar Sevaks under MGNREGA from time to time. The following decisions are being taken by the government in this regard:
The Government's Decisions:
