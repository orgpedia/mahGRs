The Proposal:
Department of Planning, Government Decision No: DCT-2316/ PR No. 133/ KA1417, dated 5th December, 2016, had decided to deposit the subsidy in the form of cash directly into the bank accounts of the beneficiaries (DBT) instead of giving subsidy in the form of goods in the various welfare schemes of the government where the subsidy is being provided by the government.
Since the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) process has been in place, the matter of" scholarship" has been involved in this process.
The centrally sponsored scholarship scheme of" Pre-Matric Scholarship Scheme" is being implemented offline by the Department of Other Backward Classes and Bahujan Welfare. The scheme is to be implemented online through the government's" Maha-DBT" website. However, due to the lockdown imposed by the government at various levels in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the necessary training in the implementation of the scheme has not been conducted at the system level. Similarly, the government's" Maha-DBT" website needs to be linked to this scheme.
The database is not yet included. Therefore, the Department of Other Backward Classes and Bahujan Welfare has proposed that the said" Pre-Matric Scholarship Scheme" needs to be implemented in offline mode for the year 2020-21. The recommendation was made by the Secretary-level Screening Committee headed by the Chief Secretary. As per the approval of the Chief Minister, the government is taking the following decisions regarding the implementation of the" Pre-Matric Scholarship Scheme" by the Other Backward Classes and Bahujan Welfare Department offline.
