Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme is implemented as a demand-driven scheme.
However, in the present situation, the state government has changed the scheme in such a way that the work should be done for prosperity, not the work. This has helped in maintaining the unskilled and skilled ratio by combining and converging the various works under the Employment Guarantee Scheme to a reasonable extent and has made it possible to get more funds from the Central Government.
Maharashtra is the parent state of the Employment Guarantee Scheme, yet every family living below the poverty line generates fewer man-days compared to other states. Thus, it impedes the achievement of the goal of poverty alleviation. As per the provisions of the Act, a contractor cannot be appointed under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. Also, at present, systems buy materials from more than one supplier, leaving a large amount of unfinished work and making it difficult to control financial discipline.
Therefore, it was under the consideration of the Government that the sectoral agencies undertaking works under the scheme for supply of goods and services under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme should procure from a single supplier as per the prescribed norms of the Government.
