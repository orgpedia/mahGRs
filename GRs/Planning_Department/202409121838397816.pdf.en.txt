Introduction: Various schemes are implemented by the administrative departments and their zonal offices for the overall development of the state. These schemes are classified into two categories, state-level and district-level.
The developmental schemes of the state are implemented and regulated by the respective departments. However, the implementation of developmental plans needs to be evaluated by third parties to identify the difficulties / shortcomings in meeting the objectives of the plan. At present, schemes are evaluated on a limited scale by the Directorate of Finance and Statistics under the Planning Department.
In order to expand the scope of assessment, a new competent and nominated GAT ATT GAT (Empanelment) is created which can advise the departments / offices of the government on the subject of sample survey and statistics. The list of such institutions was prepared under A.No.3B.5 read above. The issue of making a new list of nominees (1181011101) was under consideration of the government as the term of the said list had expired.
Government Decisions: Read above The Government Decisions referred to herein in Annexure 3, 4 and 5 respectively are being superseded by this Government Decision and the list of external entities mentioned in Annexure 1 of this Government Decision is being approved by this Government for a period of 5 years from the date of the Government Decision.
