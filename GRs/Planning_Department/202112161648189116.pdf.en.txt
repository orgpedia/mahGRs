Government Circular No. : Sthavika- 0616/ PR No.96/ K. 1482,
Ministry, Mumbai- 400 032.
Date: 16th of December 2021
Planning Department, Government Resolution No. 0616/ PR No. 96/ K. 1482 dated 12.7.2016
The Proposal:
Under the MLA Local Development Programme, the balance fund is dedicated at the end of the year after deducting the expenditure from the fund sanctioned by the government for the respective financial year. From the funds that are permissible every year, the works that have been approved by the administration, but the works have not been executed/ completed, the demand for the re-provision of the funds in the next financial year is made by the concerned collector to the planning department. For this purpose, dedicated funds are made available by providing funds through supplementary demand every year and unspent funds are rededicated at the end of the year. Due to this, an objection is taken by the Accountant General's Office every year that the supplementary demand taken under the MLA Local Development Program has been unsuccessful. Therefore, it was under the consideration of the Government to give instructions to deduct the amount of spill from the fund sanctioned in the financial year under the MLA Local Development Programme and to pay the balance amount from the fund of the current year for the works completed in the last years of the administrative approval of the works that were dedicated due to the operation/ non-completion of the works.
Government circular:
Under the MLA Local Area Development Programme, funds are disbursed from the funds made available by the Planning Department for the respective financial year, after receiving the budget and technical approval from the implementing agency, which will complete the works suggested by the legislators. Since this process consumes a lot of time, a very small amount is spent in the first 3-4 months of the financial year. Keeping this in view, the matter was under consideration to issue guidelines for spending the funds made available by the Planning Department for the respective financial year under the MLA Local Area Development Programme.
Under the MLA Local Development Program, the amount of the fund allowed for the first financial year of the term of the legislator is one and a half times and after that one and a half of the balance is deducted.
