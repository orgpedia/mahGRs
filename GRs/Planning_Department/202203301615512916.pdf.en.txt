The responsibility of taking appropriate action on the fruit and flower crops included as above will be of the Gram Panchayat as well as the Department of Agriculture and Horticulture and the responsibility of taking appropriate action on the trees included in the tree plantation program will be of the Social Forestry Department.
The beneficiary will be allowed to take benefit of the cultivation of fruit trees/ flowers/ trees under the scheme as per the prescribed criteria as per the soil test report in the beneficiary area as mentioned below: 1, 2, 3
(i) Plantation of Fruits/ Trees and Flower Vines on individual beneficiary's contiguous farm under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS).
Interaction with other departments: Beneficiaries of this scheme can take advantage of the schemes by interacting with the scheme of other departments. Other schemes like drip irrigation or wells can be taken advantage of after planting orchards. (The wells of Magrarohyo can also be taken advantage of.) )
6. Timeline for Fruit Tree Cultivation: The Panchayats as well as the Agriculture and Horticulture Department should prepare and implement a time-bound programme for the proper implementation of the Fruit Tree and Flower Tree Cultivation Scheme under MGRROHYO. Also, the social forestry branch of the forest department should prepare and implement a time-bound program to properly implement the tree plantation scheme.
Considering the monsoon season, the period of planting fruits/ flowers/ trees is from 1st June to 31st December. The district level committee will have the power to extend this period if the moisture in the soil is suitable. However, if there is an irrigation system, planting can be done anytime throughout the year. No other permission is required.
Financial Limit: Fruit orchards/ tree plantation/ phulpik plantation up to 2.0 ha per beneficiary is permissible. Therefore, the actual budgetary sanction amount for an orchard, tree or flower crop for 2.0 hectare will be the financial limit based on the financial parameters to be fixed from time to time with the approval of the government for various fruit trees and flower crops. However, the individual benefit of the orchard should be allowed up to 100 days in a year on any one job card. Families who need to work for more than 100 days should be given work on public works in addition to their own personal work. For this, all Gram Rozgar Sevaks/ Gram Sevaks/ Krishi Sahayaks should work in a planned manner by forming groups of beneficiaries.
That is, to give more than 100 days of benefits in a year to a job card holder in personal work, the help of more job card holders should be taken.
By doing this, the central government will be able to get maximum benefit. It will be possible to provide benefits to more and more families in the state in the shortest possible time.
