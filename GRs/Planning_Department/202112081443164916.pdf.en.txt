Introduction: Maharashtra is the originator of the State Employment Guarantee Scheme. The Government of India enacted the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act in 2005. The southern states (e.g. Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, etc.) started implementing it as a development plan by linking development schemes in the state. By doing so, they have been able to reduce the percentage of people below the poverty line by undertaking a large number of development works through the convergence of funds received from both the Government of India and the State Governments.
In line with this, the state of Maharashtra has also started implementing 28 schemes through convergence since 2018. The Government decision dated 30 th March, 2021 has added to it by allowing all 262 schemes permissible under MGNREGA to be implemented through convergence. Also, since the ratio of 60:40 has to be maintained at the district level, the concept of maintaining this ratio through the combination of various works under MGNREGA has been proposed. Due to these two reasons, now all the development works can be done through MNREGA. Therefore, the state of Maharashtra is now ready to work at a faster pace by getting more funds from the Government of India.
For example, in Melghat, a tribal area in Amravati district, all the village roads of 500 km length under the Public Works Department have now become possible in 2 to 3 years. Now it is possible to do the work of embankments in the tribal areas without lack of funds. The work of agricultural/ irrigation roads has now become possible on a large scale. There is a need to build a large number of godowns in the state. Now it is possible to focus on it. Anganwadis, gram panchayat buildings, concrete roads in villages, compound walls of schools, paver blocks in villages have all been made possible.

Similarly, at the individual level, it is possible to give all the benefits of cattle sheds, nadaps, orchards, trees on bunds, wells to every permissible family under MNREGA. If this happens, every family in the state will be able to become a lakhpati. It also uses 90% of the government's budget.
For all these to be successful, the MGNREGA and allied agencies (other government departments) will have to work on the idea of" work for the village and to become a millionaire" from the earlier" work for the last." For this, there is a need to provide continuous discussion/ information/ training with all the Sarpanchs, Gram Sevaks, Gram Rozgar Sevaks and other end systems of the department across the state.
Below are the most important points:
1 A task is very necessary for the family to become rich or for the development of the village. But what to do when it does not fit into the working 60:40?
2 A work (for example, Bihar pattern or nursery) cannot be done within 100 days. So how to do these things without working for more than 100 days on any job card.
3 It is not necessary to give 4 to 5 mats to a family to make it rich. So how can all this be given under MGNREGA?
4 Labourers should be paid wages as soon as possible. How to make a payment within 4 days?
5. How to complete any work in time so that the people of the state get the benefit of the same immediately?
6 If a village is to be developed rapidly, what should be done and how to complete more and more works quickly.
7 How to get more work done in a village.
With new technologies like YouTube, Google, Zoom, Google Meet, etc., it is now possible to conduct at least two hours of discussions/ training/ webinars every week with every system in every block. The Government was contemplating to put in place a mechanism to collect, create, plan and organize the topics, content, training mediums (What's app, Video, YouTube channel, Zoom interaction, hands-on training) to be taken up in such discussions/ trainings on priority.
The government has taken the following decisions:
Government Decision: Training and human resource development system is being implemented under MGNREGA. Details will be as follows.
1) A Chief Instructor at the state level will be working in the Ministry. The location of their headquarters will be flexible as the technology ages.

7.4 Compilation of articles, documents, audio, video etc. generated during the training and uploading them on the website of the State Government/ Commissioner. So that the people in the system will have the material for self learning and gradually the need for training will be reduced.
Part-time Trainer: District MIS Coordinator/ APO/ PTO/ GRS will be invited as a trainer as per their merit and training requirement. Similarly, many government officials seem to have evolved from self-development to the level of a coach. About 100 officers and staff will be appointed as trainers through the selection process.
Selection Process: The candidates will be required to fill up a Google Form. A selection process will be conducted for the selected candidates. Such a process will be done every six months so that the newly developing employees also get a chance and every employee remains self-developed.
All the government officials joining MNREGA will be given training for two-three days. A trainer will also be selected during the training.
Remuneration: The day-long training will be of 6 hours duration with 4 sessions of 1.5 hours each.
The rates of remuneration are decided as per the level and type of training.

11.4 Chief Trainers: State Training Coordinators have been appointed at the government level. They conduct training, creation of component sets, training needs assessment, district, division or state level meetings/ workshops, field visits, etc. During the period of such employment, they will be referred to as Chief Instructors and will be entitled to a remuneration of Rs.2,500/-per day for such employment. The hourly method will not be applicable.
11.5. State Level Trainers: Some of the staff and officers perform to a high standard and provide high quality training. If such high quality staff/ officials are found, the State Government will declare them as State Level Trainers. The honorarium for these trainers will be Rs.1500/- (Rs.500/- per session, up to a maximum of 3 sessions) at the department level also.

11.6 This policy has been under discussion for a long time. The decision has already been made. Therefore, the remuneration for the training conducted earlier as well as for all the works of the State Training Coordinator will also be paid according to this government decision.
All the above rates will be applicable only for the trainings conducted by the State Government or the Commissioner. State and division level human resource development coordinators and officers working under the department will not be allowed honorarium in their respective areas of work.
All of the above must be done correctly.
The order will come into effect immediately.
