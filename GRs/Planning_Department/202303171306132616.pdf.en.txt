The government has approved the implementation of Sharad Pawar Gram Samriddhi Yojana State Plan through the combination of some schemes under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. In this government decision, instructions have been given to ban pucca cowsheds for cows and buffaloes. According to this, tagging of animals will be required along with the proposal of the hoarders. Cows, buffaloes that have been allotted by taking a bank loan or through animal husbandry or other departments can be tagged. However, the animals taken at their own expense are not tagged.
Problems arise in giving and the beneficiary is deprived of the benefit of this scheme even though he is eligible. The government is working to resolve the issue. Accordingly, the tagging of the animals with the proposal of the hoarders in the second paragraph of the permissibility issue No. 1) in the above Reference Government Decision will be required. "
In lieu of this
" The concerned Gram Sevak/ Technical Assistant/ Gram Rozgar Sevak should authenticate the data of animals available with the beneficiaries by conducting panchnama. While doing panchnama
Gram sevaks, teachers of zilla parishad schools or any other government employee will be required to be present. This should be read.
