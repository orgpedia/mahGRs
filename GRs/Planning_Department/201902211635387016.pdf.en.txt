Under the Employment Guarantee Scheme, the scheme of" Farming for the needy" is being implemented. This is being implemented as per Government Decision dated 17.02.2016. In this scheme, a total of 7 types of farmlands of 15 meter X 15 meter X 3 meter to 30 meter X 30 meter X 3 meter with inlet outlet and a total of 6 types of farmlands of 20 X 20 X 3 to 30 X 30 X 3 meter without inlet outlet are permissible. The farmers can earn a maximum of Rs. The subsidy is admissible to the farmer within the limit of Rs 50,000/-.
Considering the drought-like situation in the state, there is likely to be a huge demand for labour work at the field level. Considering the future demand for work, there may be a need to provide local employment to the workers at the regional level as per the demand. The proposal that while digging the farm under the' Magel toa farm' scheme, some of the work can be done by the laborer and the remaining work on the difficult ground level (can not be done by the laborer) can be done in the' Magel toa farm' scheme, was submitted by the Director, Soil Conservation and Watershed Management, Commissionerate of Agriculture, Pune, along with the budget, at serial number 8 in the context. The same has been submitted to the Government vide letter dated 15.12.2018. Accordingly, the state
