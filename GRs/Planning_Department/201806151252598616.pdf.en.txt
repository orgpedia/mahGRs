Read:- 1) Government Resolution, Planning Division, No: DONWIKA-2009/ Q.No.6/ Q. 1483, dated 18.01.2010.
The Proposal:
The government has a policy to ensure balanced development of all the departments of the state and in view of the fact that the hill department has certain requirements, the government has set certain criteria for determining the hill department. At present, the programme is being implemented in 73 full-fledged Dongri Taluks and 35 sub-group Dongri Taluks in 22 districts of the state. The Government has created new taluks as per the provisions of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, 1966. Sindhudurg), Trimbakeshwar (Dist. Nashik (Maharashtra). Nanded), Phulambri (Dist. Aurangabad and Vikramgad. Palghar) have been divided and newly created. However, the newly created taluks and the villages included in the new taluks, which are included under the Hill Development Programme but only by division, are deprived of the benefits of the Hill Development Programme that they were already getting. As Talukas and included villages are the criteria under the Hill Development Programme, the matter of inclusion of newly created Talukas/ villages in the Hill Area by bifurcating the existing Hill Taluks and including only those included in the erstwhile Hill Taluks was under the consideration of the Government.
The following decision has been taken:
Government's decision:
At present, there are 73 full-fledged Dongri Taluks and 35 sub-group Dongri Taluks in 22 districts under the Dongri Development Programme. As the government created new taluks as per the provisions of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, 1966, the newly created full-fledged taluks of Dodamarg, Trimbakeshwar, Mahur and three sub-group taluks of Vikramgad, Devla and Phulambri were included in the hill division by bifurcating the existing hill taluks.
