The Proposal:
Department of Planning, Government Decision No: DCT-2316/ PR No. 133/ KA1417, dated 5th December, 2016, had decided to deposit the subsidy in the form of cash directly into the bank accounts of the beneficiaries (DBT) instead of giving subsidy in the form of goods in the various welfare schemes of the government where the subsidy is being provided by the government. The item" Uniform" has been shown at" Annexure-A" at" A. No.8" of the said Government Resolution.
2. Under the free uniform scheme under the Centrally Sponsored Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, Rs. 400 is provided by the School Education and Sports Department. Under the free education scheme, Rs. School students are facing difficulties in opening and maintaining a" Zero Balance Savings Bank Account" for a year to be credited directly to the bank accounts of beneficiaries in 400 cash. School students are not getting free" uniform" kits on time as banks are mandated to follow various regulations such as" SMS charges/ GST charges" and" Minimum Balance Charges" for bank transactions. Therefore, in the larger public interest, all punishments are meted out through the process of transfer of benefits in kind, in cash, directly to the beneficiary's bank account (DBT).
