The Proposal:
As per the provisions of the Maharashtra District Planning Committee (Composition and Functions) Act, 1998, District Planning Committees have been reduced in every district of the state. As ex-officio Member Secretary of the District Planning Committee, the concerned Collector has been entrusted with the responsibility of disbursing funds under the District Annual Plans, providing administrative approval and reallocating funds, etc. In addition to this, administrative approval is also given by the Collector for the works to be taken up under MP Local Development Programme, MLA Local Development Programme, Hill Development Programme, Human Development Programme and other programmes/ schemes.
In order to computerize the information of the works to be sanctioned under the District Annual Plan (General) and under various programs/ schemes by the office of the District Planning Committee, in order to make the administration people-oriented, transparent and dynamic, and to make the control of the works under the District Annual Plan through the District Planning Committee and the Executive Committee effective, there was a need to develop a computerized system to computerize all the documents in the office of the District Planning Committee and to work without paper. Keeping this in mind, a comprehensive" Web-based" computing system" IPAS-Integrated Planning Office Automation System" for the office of the District Planning Committee has been developed as a pilot project in Nashik district.
