Introduction: Multi-purpose social and economic sample surveys have been conducted since 1950 by the National Sample Survey Office under the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, Government of India, to collect data on select topics of importance. The Government of Maharashtra also started participating in the event on a similar basis from 1955. A separate sample selection for the state is carried out by the Directorate of Economics and Statistics. The participation is aimed at providing district-level estimates of various aspects of the state's economic and social status by collating estimates based on the Centre B state model. The findings from these observations were used to formulate various government policies as well as to estimate state revenues. The data collected under the National Sample Survey is analysed and tabulated to draw conclusions based on the state sample by topic. Conclusions are also drawn based on aggregated data on state and central models. To validate these findings, the Expert Committee was constituted under the above-mentioned Government Decision. A proposal to reconstitute the committee was under the consideration of the government.
Government Decision: Under this Government Decision, it is approved to reconstitute the Committee constituted under the Government Decision dated 7th June, 2017 of the Department for validation of findings based on subject-wise aggregated information by analysing and tabulating the data collected under State Nominations under National Sample Survey as well as State and Central Sample Surveys as follows.
