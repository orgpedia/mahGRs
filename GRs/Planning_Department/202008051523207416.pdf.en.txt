The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005.
2) Annual Master Circular 2020- 21 3) Government Decisions and Circulars issued from time to time by the implementation of the Employment Guarantee Scheme
Introduction: The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) has been implemented in all the 34 rural districts of the State in a phased manner from 2005 to 2008. The main objectives of the scheme are to provide work to the needy, to provide collective and individual infrastructure through that work, and to double the income of farmers by 2022, which will lead to prosperity of the villages. We all know that MGREGS was in operation since 1970. Some of the districts that have planned and implemented the scheme are on the road to prosperity. But not all states have done so.
All the villages of the state will prosper if they work in a planned manner. The number of unskilled workers will also be reduced. For this purpose, MGNREGS is to be planned in the future. As the planning unit is the Gram Panchayat, the labour budget and action plan of the Gram Panchayat should be prepared keeping in view the objective of how each Gram Panchayat and the constituent villages of that Gram Panchayat will prosper and how the people of those villages will move on the path of wealth. That is, in order to bring economic prosperity, the work that is needed in the villages should be identified and the families living on the demand of unskilled work should be involved in those works in such a way that at some point the family will not demand unskilled work by improving its financial condition.

The biggest skill is to mark the right kind of work in this auspicious work of creating a prosperous Maharashtra. Every sarpanch has to develop the skill to think about what works can be taken up to bring prosperity in their villages. MGNREGS
A list of the tasks that can be taken internally is given in this circular. But those tasks can be selected, prioritized, planned and executed qualitatively, by developing the skills, observation, field visits, study and reflection of documents and videos. The government will also organise training programmes for them. If sarpanches need this kind of expertise, it is obvious that every one of the MGNREGS implementing agencies needs to be trained and brainstormed on the need for careful monitoring, field visits, study of documents and videos.
Rural areas are those areas where the percentage of people engaged in basic economic activities is high. The rural economy is based on agriculture and animal husbandry.
At another level, rural life depends on soil, water and plants. If all these three aspects are taken care of properly, then the village will start moving on the path of prosperity. Adding quality education to it will lead to prosperity of the village.
We have named the activities to enrich water, soil and trees as soil and water conservation. Since the villages are agrarian, one would agree that the villages will develop rapidly by taking agriculture and allied activities on priority. So under the mission water conservation under MGNREGS at least 65% of the works in the taluks are expected to be taken up for soil and water conservation works and in all the districts, at least 60% of the works for agriculture and agriculture allied works. All these works will lead to the development of water, land, trees and life of villages, taluks and districts.
If you think that the availability of such work is less while planning the village, then it means that it is not possible to increase the income from agriculture and related work in those villages. This needs to be checked. For this, if the average income per hectare of a prosperous village is more than that of your village, then the planning, selected works, implemented plans and use plans for the development of water, soil and trees of that village should be studied. The information about the villages near your village will be obtained from the taluk/ district level officers.
The proper planning of natural resources is called integrated natural resources management. It includes the concept of watershed development from head to foot. Complete information about this concept of watershed development

Get it. Ask for training from the BDO if needed. The government will definitely provide training if any training is sought in the matter of MGNREGS.
The focus of the plan for the year 2021-22 should be on generating productive output by converging other schemes with the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. Gram Panchayats will be responsible for the annual planning and implementation of the scheme and all other State agencies will be involved in the planning and implementation.
With the above planned and quality work, the per hectare income of the farmers of our village will increase. This will reduce the number of people living below the poverty line. Migration from villages for unskilled labour will be stopped. Pregnant women and children are malnourished. With the stoppage of migration of families, 100 per cent attendance of children in schools will be seen as regular. Constantly interact with teachers to ensure that children get quality education. Free online training is available for teachers. Teachers should be encouraged to take up this training. We should ensure that the next generation does not have to work through education.
Migration and Education: Migration of children with parents results in loss of education. Therefore, it is not possible to allow seasonal migration of parents. For this, MGNREGS has to be planned.
Since we are planning this so that the education of the children does not get drowned, we have to ensure that 100% of the children get high quality education. Although this is not the work of MGNREGS, it is necessary to mention here as we are working for the prosperity of the villages. For your information, it is said that 100% children are considered important to be able to read and do basic mathematical activities. Also, there is a test called National Achievement Survey for children who get orphans. Sarpanches and villagers can see at their own level whether reading and basic mathematical activities are available to all children. They can also check whether the children have achieved the national achievement level.
An app has been developed by the state education department for this purpose.
The link is https:// play. google. com/ store/ apps/ details? id= com. pixelstat. diet
Completion of work:- All the necessary works are to be taken up according to the availability of manpower by making a list and setting priorities. You have to ensure that you complete a task on time. Because if you don't work, you don't get paid.
Also, there is a risk of getting washed away in the rain.

If more manpower is required to complete a task quickly, the physically fit persons in the village should be urged to help in completing the task. Many villages in the state have developed themselves through labour. If such people do not like to work, they should do it as a labor donation. However, they will get wages under MGNREGS. They can donate the money to schools and other causes.
The circular is for 2021-22, but for 2020-21, after the end of the farming season this year.
If the number of workers is expected to be more than the approved labor budget, then the supplementary labor budget for 2020-21 should also be prepared.
New Sanctioned Works- Not sanctioned during the last circular. But now they are approved. The new tasks are as follows: These works will also be included in the labour budget if there is a need in the village.
Gram Panchayat Building 2. Construction of Public Toilets

| More man-days have been created.                                          |
| The planning will have to be done by the Gram Panchayat.                  |
| Along with this, the following points should be taken into consideration. |
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Many small businesses have suffered due to the Corona epidemic. People working in urban areas will work in villages.
2. In order to develop a prosperous village, migration of children needs to be stopped.
If the parents are not migrating in search of more income compared to MGNREGS, they will have to stop migration. This will also increase the number of labourers in the villages.
At present, wages are paid once in two weeks in MGNREGS. Some financially weak people are not able to do the work of MGNREGS due to this reason. As per the provisions of the Act, the Maharashtra government is planning to pay wages every week. This will attract more people towards MGNREGS. This will increase employment.
More people will be called to work to complete the work. This will also increase the manpower.
The government is planning to create an app-based system for work demand. This will also increase the number of employees.
A survey should be conducted in every Gram Panchayat to count the number of all the above types of additional manpower.
