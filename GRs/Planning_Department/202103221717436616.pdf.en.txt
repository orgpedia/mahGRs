Under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, rainwater harvesting should be done in all government offices and offices of local bodies in the state through the Jan Shakti Abhiyan.
Apart from this, the following works should be implemented through the Jal Shakti Abhiyan in a phased manner.
100% of the wells started under MNREGA should be completed in this period.
At least two villages behind each TPO and at least one village behind each agricultural assistant in the taluk should be dug up in the fields of more and more farmers by implementing the concept of water to every farm through farm ponds. For this, according to the need, different sizes of farms should be approved.
Under this campaign, a campaign should be undertaken to remove more and more silt from various water sources.
By implementing all the above, the Gram Rozgar Sevaks should be motivated to work so that 100% Gram Rozgar Sevaks of their district/ taluka will get at least Rs.5000/- as man-days as the average honorarium for these three months.
Under this campaign, the following activities will be covered:
The committees at the district, taluka and village level, formed by the government decision of the Department of Sanitation and Water Supply, will work for the implementation and control of this campaign.

7.Incentives to agricultural assistants and TPOs who have succeeded in providing farm land to more than 90% of the account holders in at least one village will be given with the approval of the Additional Devotees Regulatory Board.
8. If farmers irrigate the field, it will be useful for water storage and it is used as protected irrigation. If the area under MNREGA is 60:40 unskilled, then the fertilization should be allowed and the guidelines in this regard should be used as prescribed by the Department of Agriculture.
Many farmers are not willing to take the fields in their fields because they think that the land will be covered by the farm. But it can also produce more income.
There are also farmers in our state who earn a lot by cultivating orchards and fish farming by constructing farms and making economical use of its water (drip/ drip irrigation etc.). Similarly, villages such as Mauje Ajnale taluka Sangola district Solapur, Mauje Kadavanchi taluka and Jalna district are known to have achieved 100% profit through farming.
By watching the videos of these villages on YouTube, we should also inspire the farmers.
10.In the next few days, information will be disseminated about the farmers who have become millionaires by cultivating pulses and oilseeds using economical water.
