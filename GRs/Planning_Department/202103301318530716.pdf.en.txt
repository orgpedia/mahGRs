Introduction: It is the intention of the government that every family in the state should be prosperous/ lakhpati. For this, the state government has taken several steps. So a lot of work has been done. When we look at the villages of the state, in many villages, farmers are now becoming prosperous by learning from each other. In recent times, various social media are also being used extensively for such learning. Therefore, at one level, the farmers with facilities are moving forward rapidly, while other farmers are realizing the need to provide facilities quickly.
So read on. 2 The purpose was to encourage convergence in government decision-making. Now the demand for permission to carry out all the development works through circulation has started coming from the people's representatives and the field officers.
260 works are permissible under MGNREGA. So, 100 per cent of the development works can be taken up under MNREGA. Once such work is taken up, it should be done in the ratio of 60:40 and completed on time.

Doing so creates problems. The government was trying to address the issue. The government has taken the following decisions:
Government's decision:
The government is giving approval to take 100 per cent of the permissible works under MNREGA through convergence.
2. On receipt of this approval, the following guidelines are being issued to the District Administration to remove the difficulties faced by them in fulfilling the responsibility of" Asking for work" and to complete the work expeditiously.
2.1. Preparation and approval of budgets for various works.
The budget of various works depends on the DSR of that year, the rate of wages permissible under MGNREGA for that year and the distance from those works of various materials required for various works. Therefore, it is not appropriate to announce the budget at the state level for any kind of works like roads, agricultural lands, waterlogged roads etc. In the past, many government decisions have been accompanied by some budgets and the amount of inefficiency, skill and circulation associated with it. Such budgets as well as various ratios which are based on the rates at that time. All these budgets and the various ratios associated with them expire when the new DSR new or wage rates are announced. These guidelines aimed at facilitating the sectoral mechanisms to work, the budgets and ratios create obstacles for the sectoral mechanisms to work in later periods. This will avoid sharing of budgets and ratios with government decisions in the future. The budgets and ratios that have been added earlier are being overhauled to the extent that they create hurdles in functioning due to rate changes or other reasons.
Also, the task of preparing new budgets is delegated to the officials at different levels in different departments under the government, the same authority will prepare the budget for MNREGA works, which is being approved. However, after such a budget is prepared, as per the 60:40 rule of MGNREGA, how much of it can be done from the MGNREGA fund and for the remaining part, the amount of convergence can be made available from the fund under which government scheme, and if there is no fund available for convergence from any government scheme, then what other works of MGNREGA should be done more, which will make more unskilled work and more skilled work available, the structure of the committee is being revised at the district level under the chairmanship of the Collector and at the taluka level under the chairmanship of the Sub-Divisional Officer.

The process of implementing the planning process:
Read No. In the Government Decision dated 5.11.2018, 28 works were budgeted for convergence from the Commissionerate level. These budgets included the unskilled (Part-A) and skilled (Part-B) components under MGNREGA and the skilled component (Part-C) from other schemes. The budget is a guide and is in order to prepare the budget as per the requirement of each district, keeping in view the geographical and work requirements of each district. As it has now been decided to implement all the permissible works under the MGNREGA schemes through convergence, the convergence plan should be implemented with special attention to the following points while implementing the works taken from the convergence.
Requirements for implementing the plan:
Once the model budget is approved, the implementing mechanism whose funds are to be used in the circulation, will give technical and administrative approval as per the prevailing practice and the same mechanism will implement the work.
2. A single execution mechanism will execute a task.
3. The budget of the works approved in the Convergence Plan should be based on the sample budget approved by the District Level Committee and the budget should include the MGNREGA.
Technical approval for Part-A (unskilled) and Part-B (skilled) and Part-C (skilled) will be required to be given by the competent authority of the concerned implementing agencies.
The administrative approval of the works in the Convergence Plan will be given by the Implementing Agency (PIA) of the MGNREGA scheme as decided by the District Level Committee.
The skilled part of the work to be taken from other schemes (Part-C) will be admissible from all the district and state level schemes currently running for that work.
The entire measurement of these works will be done by the concerned technical officers and it will be mandatory to take a note of it in the measurement booklet of the MGNREGA scheme.

7. Under the Convergence, the records of measurement of the items on which the implementing agency is providing funds as per the budget, are maintained by the implementing agency.
It will be necessary to prepare a separate record for reference of the implementation mechanism by taking it from the measurement book of the scheme.
8. For unskilled work undertaken under MGNREGA (Part-A), e-muster should be removed and wages should be paid to the workers as per the prevailing system.
Provisions for skilled work (Part-B) taken under MGNREGA should be made through PFMS.
10.Providing the skilled share (Part-C) taken from the other scheme should be done by the concerned department implementing the scheme as per their prevailing practice.
After completion of 11.A., the completion of this work shall be required to be jointly signed by the authorized officer of the MGNREGS system and other systems involved in the circulation.
Geo-tagging (Stage 1/2/3) of completed work under MGNREGS will be mandatory as per the guidelines of the Central Government while implementing 12.A.
13.It is mandatory to take up works under the above recommendations in rural areas only.
14.There shall be no use of machinery displacing contractors and labourers for works under the Act.

GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: MGRRO 2021/ P.No.26/ ROHYO-10A
Maintaining the ratio of 60:40: Except for the work of Bhoo-Sanjeevani NADEP composting, the ratio of unskilled to unskilled work of construction of cattle shed, construction of goatshed and cuckoo shed is 8:92, 9:91 and 10:90 respectively under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme.
In this regard, the ratio of 60:40 (unskilled-skilled) of the districts will not be maintained due to these works. Therefore, in order to maintain the unskilled-skilled ratio while undertaking these works, the following other permissible works should be undertaken.
1) Planting and nurturing individual trees (3 years- 1 hectare) (any tree or a mixture of different trees)
2) Individual farms- 15 x 15 x 3.00
3) Planting trees on farm or dam (Bihar pattern)
(4) The pitfalls
5) Compost Bundling
The above list is just an example. However, to maintain the ratio of 60:40, whatever work is suggested by the Gram Panchayat/ beneficiary and the system can be taken up. Similarly, various works should be sanctioned to one beneficiary and the ratio of 60:40 should be maintained at each beneficiary level. In exceptional cases, the ratio of 60:40 should be maintained by utilising the skilled expenditure from other personal or public works savings.
Similarly, the ratio of unskilled-skilled expenditure should be maintained at 60:40 by taking up private and public works in Gram Panchayats where the proportion of unskilled expenditure is high out of 275 individual and public works permissible under NREGA.
The above details have been provided for the purpose of maintaining 60:40 ratio while awarding works of individual benefit.
However, the decisions of the present government will also be applicable to public works.
