The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), launched in 2008, aims to provide at least 100 days of guaranteed employment to rural households in the country. The central government has given permission to hire manpower on contract basis for the implementation of this scheme.

Government Resolution No: MgrRohyo 2021/ P. No.78/ Rohyo 7
Accordingly, MIS Coordinators, Assistant Programme Officers, Technical Officers, Clerks cum Data Entry Operators are appointed on contract basis at the field level.
The guidelines have been issued in accordance with the Government Decision dated 11th February, 2013 and 11th November, 2020 of the Department of Planning (ROHYO) for the appointment of contractual employees at the district and taluka level. At present, according to the decision of the government, appointments are made at the regional level on the basis of man-days generated every year.
However, in the above-mentioned manner, the Collector's office, Zilla Parishad office and the machinery department need these posts, but the distribution of these posts does not seem to be done in a balanced manner and the field machinery is asked to provide manpower from time to time.
" The central government's MGNREGS scheme and the state's Maharashtra Employment Guarantee Scheme are being implemented effectively in the state, raising the standard of living of every farmer in the state and successfully implementing the concept of"" I am prosperous, village is prosperous and"" Village is prosperous, my Maharashtra is prosperous." For this, the composition of contractual employees appointed at the state, division, district and panchayat committee level needs to be changed taking into account the following factors:
a) Providing more manpower/ staff where large scale work is being done. Like the Panchayat committees which control the Gram Panchayat.
b) NREGA Soft system has reduced paper work like data collection. Hence, creation of new/ more posts at the Panchayat level by doing away with the redundant posts in the higher level offices.
c)" Panchayat Raj" needs to be centralized as per the requirements of MGNREGS scheme. For example, at the gram panchayat, panchayat samiti and zila parishad levels, the sanctioned figure should be revised accordingly.
Under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (hereinafter referred to as" ROHYO"), a large number of works are taken up by the machinery other than the Gram Panchayat and a large number of jobs are provided at the local level. However, no contractual manpower is being provided at the said level. Providing contractual staff as per the requirement of work at the system level (based on the generation of man-days) will help in increasing the pace of work.
For this, the number of contractual employees needs to be fixed by considering the district as a unit instead of the talukas in the district where there is less employment generation.

Government Resolution No: MgrRohyo 2021/ P. No.78/ Rohyo 7
Appointment of suitable personnel as Community Mobiliser at the block level in the talukas where the HDI index is low or there are tribal-dominated or backward taluks and there is a need to create permanent value by providing employment to the people through ROHYO will help in the expansion of ROHYO effectively in the entire state of Maharashtra.
For all the above reasons, the State Govt. Additional Chief Secretary Shri.
A committee was formed under the chairmanship of Giriraj Singh to study the issue of restructuring of the employment guarantee department. As per the report of the Committee, the Commissioner, Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, Nagpur has submitted a proposal to the Commissioner, NREGA, Nagpur for transfer of 192, 106 and 505 posts of Assistant Programme Officer (APO), Technical Assistant (PTO) and Clerk cum Data Entry Operator (CDEO) respectively to the office where more manpower is required.
In view of the above situation, the Government was contemplating to re-deploy the additional contractual manpower working in various posts in the State and provide additional manpower at the field level as mentioned below.
Government Decision: As per the Man-Day created in the financial year 2020-21, the posts of District MIS Coordinator, Programme Manager, Assistant Programme Officer, Technical Assistant and Clerk cum Data Entry Operator are being made available to the field agencies in the revised manner as mentioned below.
The proposal submitted by the Commissioner, NREGA, Nagpur is being approved at the government level and the posts of Clerk cum Data Entry Operator (CDEO) are being offered to the field machinery working under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, 12 posts are being proposed in the Divisional Commissioner's Office, 34 posts in the Collector's Office and 68 posts in the Zilla Parishad Office.
A) Clerk cum Data Entry Operator (CDEO) In the district, mainly at the taluka level, three agencies- Agriculture Department, Forest Department and Social Forestry Department- implement the work of ROHO. Clerk cum Data Entry Operator is being appointed in each district on the basis of man-days generated by the system department as follows.

Government Resolution No: MgrRohyo 2021/ P. No.78/ Rohyo 7
Clerk cum Data Entry Operator is being appointed in the authority of the District Level Officers for the Taluks which are likely to produce good human days on the basis of the human days generated at the District Level of the concerned Department.
Above Average Man Days of the concerned Department in the State- 3 Data Entry Operator Generation (Average Man days/ 2) to Average Man Days Generation- 2 Data Entry Operator All Other Districts- 1 Data Entry Operator
Similarly, on the basis of the person days generated at the taluka level, data entry operators are being appointed in the office of the taluka level officer as follows: More than 25000 person days generated 1 Data entry operator Less than 25000 person days generated
In accordance with the above formula, the Government is approving the appointment of Data Entry Operators as mentioned in Appendix-A in accordance with the person days generated by the above three departmental machinery in the financial year 2020-21.
The district system head will also be responsible for providing the data entry operators at the district level to the potential talukas that will create good man-days. It will be mandatory for the district head of the concerned agency to appoint the data entry operators to be provided at the district level to the designated taluka level officers without having to work in their office. The number of Data Entry Operators to be appointed district-wise and taluk-wise for all the three systems is mentioned in Annexure-A and Annexure-B.
b) State Technical Coordinators and Technical Assistants are available for carrying out technical works at the Technical Assistant Commissioner's Office and Panchayat Samiti level, SECURE works respectively. But due to the unavailability of employees with knowledge of the SECURE system at the district level, the Commissioner's office is facing difficulties in coordinating directly at the taluk level. Therefore, one post of District Nodal Technical Assistant is being created in Zila Parishad in every district and one post of Technical Assistant is being appointed in that district. However, in the district where it is not possible to appoint a District Nodal Technical Assistant due to shortage of Technical Assistant post, approval is being provided to appoint one Technical Assistant from another district of the Revenue Department as District Nodal Technical Assistant.
