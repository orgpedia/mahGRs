Introduction: The above reference No. 1 Here is the decision of the Namud Government, Public Works Department, d. 29.11.2016, the Government has approved the implementation of Hybrid Annuity Scheme in the State on the lines of Central Government's Hybrid Annuity Model for improvement of 10,000 km of roads under the Public Works Department for the next two years from 2016-17 for the overall development of roads in the State. 2 Here is the decision of the government of Namud, d. The consolidated instructions in this regard have been issued by the Public Works Department vide order dated 01.11.2018.
(2) To issue guidelines through the Planning Department regarding the matters brought to the notice of the Committee in accordance with the revised administrative approval proposals to be submitted to the Expenditure Priority Committee of the projects being implemented under this scheme. Suggestions have been given in the meeting held on 5th September, 2023.
Proposals for revised administrative approval of projects being implemented under the Hybrid Annuity Scheme are submitted to the Expenditure Priority Committee after approval of the Planning Department and the Finance Department. While examining these proposals, it has been observed that due to delay in tendering process, consequent price revision and price hike, laxity shown in granting administrative approval for shifting of service lines, change in scope and new works arising out of actual work, etc., the cost of projects under Hybrid Annuity Scheme has to be increased and revised administrative approval has to be obtained. Considering all these aspects, the government was considering issuing guidelines on the action to be taken in granting administrative approval/ revised administrative approval to the projects being implemented under the Hybrid Annuity Scheme.
Government Circular: The following guidelines are being issued regarding the action to be taken while giving administrative approval/ revised government approval to the projects being implemented under the Hybrid Annuity Scheme. :

Preparation of Packages under Hybrid Annuity Scheme While selecting the packages under Hybrid Annuity Scheme, the Public Works Department should give priority to the projects which are technically suitable and connect the district headquarters with the Taluka/ Block Headquarters or Taluka/ Block Headquarters with the Gram Panchayat. So that these packages become well defined for future maintenance repairs with clear accountability as per the contract.
In case of projects taken up under the Hybrid Annuity Scheme, if the change in the tariff list before the finalization of the tender after administrative approval and technical approval leads to an increase of 10 percent or more in the project price, then the administrative approval in the case of such projects should be revised as per the current tariff and only then the tender process should be carried out and the work order should be taken.
The Public Works Department should strictly adhere to the time line for tendering and ensure that the award of work takes place on time.
So that the implementation of the project becomes feasible.
3. Nominal provision is taken into account while preparing the budgets for road works to be taken up under various projects without taking into account the actual amount of utility shifting. In the future, the cost of these projects will increase significantly. This, in turn, leads to a huge increase in the project cost and improved administrative approvals for such proposals. As a result, there is an increase in time and cost over run in project implementation. So, the consultant should do the survey and determine the utility shifting alignment. While preparing the budget of such works, the loose provision of Utility Shifting should be shown on the basis of actual survey and as a factual indicator.
4) While determining the basic administrative approval in case of utility shifting, appointment of consultant, etc., the expenditure in this regard should be accurately considered as" Pre-tender Activity." Also, the service charge of the consultant should be fixed in proportion to the amount of the original administrative sanction and not as a percentage of the administrative sanction/ revised administrative sanction. Government Decision while appointing Consultant, Public Works Department, No. Khakses 2015/ S.No.209/ Roads-9A, Dy. The provisions of 24.01.2017 should be strictly followed.
5. It has been observed from the revised administrative approval proposals submitted for the approval of the Planning Department that after the acceptance of the tender, many new works which are not included in the administrative approval are taken up during the actual work and are included in the revised administrative approval proposal. So, the scope of the project changes. Such Change of Scope proposals are generally not considered once the Public Works Department accepts bids for packages under the Hybrid Annuity Scheme. The entire responsibility of the increased financial burden arising out of the change in the scope of work in respect of the projects falls on the State Government. Such scope changes hinder the sharing of the proposal cost, and thus the basic purpose of the process. If there is a need to change the scope of work in unavoidable circumstances, in such a case, the decision should be taken with the consent of the Finance and Planning Department with the prior approval of the Secretary of the concerned department.
Under the Hybrid Annuity Scheme, the investment by the government and the entrepreneur is in the ratio of 60:40. However, in some states and the Centre, the investment ratio between the government and the entrepreneur is 40:60.

Accordingly, the Public Works Department should consider including bidding criteria for maximum investment by entrepreneurs in the tender process.
7) The Public Works Department should ensure that no work order is issued to the entrepreneur until the land acquisition process is completed under the Hybrid Annuity Scheme.
