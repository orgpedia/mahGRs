Introduction: Under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, work is going on in a big way in the state and the Department of Employment Guarantee Scheme has started moving with the principle of" I am prosperous, village is prosperous, village is prosperous and my Maharashtra is prosperous."
Many new aspects have been included in the way people in rural areas, farmers and landless agricultural laborers will go on the path of prosperity, and many obstacles have been reduced to effectively implement this scheme in rural areas. The Employment Guarantee Scheme is working to provide wages, create assets from these wages and raise the standard of living of the poor in rural areas.
Government circular:
As per various Government decisions/ circulars referred to above, the Government has directed to keep 5 works in each Gram Panchayat on the shelf. Accordingly, the action is taken by the District Programme Coordinator and Sahajila Programme Coordinator Officers.
However, keeping work on the shelf is understood as keeping a list of at least 5 tasks in the labor budget for the year in which they are performed. But after the workers demand the work, the work is delayed due to the technical and administrative approval after the demand of the workers. Therefore, it is necessary

Due to the inability to provide work to the laborers on time, there is no production of alcohol and due to the lack of such production, the poor in the rural areas are hindered from living comfortably.
Therefore, works which do not have technical and administrative approvals to ensure timely delivery of work to the needy labourers will no longer be considered as works on the shelf.
The security system has been in place for the past three years. It shows how many works have been given technical and administrative approval in each Gram Panchayat/ village. Therefore, it is suggested that by 31st October, 2021, at least 5 works in each village should be put up for technical and administrative approval and should be included in the SECURE system.
In every Gram Panchayat, the Mechanization Department i.e. Forest Department, Agriculture Department, Social Forestry and other machinery should complete the process of giving administrative approval to 2 works or twice the number of Gram Panchayats in the taluk and inform the Gram Panchayat through the concerned Block Development Officer/ Tehsildar. The Deputy Collector (ROHYO) should control the administrative approval process of the systems as above and ensure that the shelves of works are created at the level of the systems.
The Deputy Collector (ROHYO) should visit 5 Gram Panchayats every month and inspect the self-employment of Gram Panchayats and other systems.
The following steps should be taken to keep the work on the shelf.
Schedule for keeping at least 5 works on the shelf in every Gram Panchayat and village. :
1.1 Last date for providing works on the shelf with technical and administrative approval in each Gram Panchayat. It will be September 30, 2021.
1.2 Where there is a group Gram Panchayat, at least 5 works with technical and administrative approval in at least half of the revenue village will be provided. It will be on October 15, 2021.
1.3 Last date for providing at least 5 works each with technical and administrative approval in all revenue villages of the State. This will be on October 31, 2021.
In every Gram Panchayat/ Village where the above works are on the shelf, at least 40% of the available works (at least 2 out of 5 works) should be of public nature.
Since the prosperity budget is to be prepared from this year, each village is expected to have 50, 100 or 500 works on the shelf. Incentive prizes will be given to the first three villages in each taluk for the maximum number of works on the shelf. Complete instructions for payment of the prize will be provided as soon as possible.
