Government circular
As per sub-section 6, section 14 of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act 2005, the District Programme Coordinator is expected to prepare the labour budget of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme.
The State of Maharashtra has already provided training in line with the Labour Budget at the district and taluka level to prepare this year's Labour Budget as Samruddhi Labour Budget.
The Department of Employment Guarantee Scheme has adopted the principle of" I am prosperous, village is prosperous, village is prosperous and Maharashtra is prosperous."
The department has implemented the" Sharad Pawar Gram Samriddhi Yojana" in the state and this scheme will provide agricultural linkages to the youth, labourers and farmer families in rural areas. Through this, the family will be taken into account as the focal point, not the village. Gram Panchayat, Panchayat Samiti,

The responsibilities of the Zila Parishad and other involved agencies of the state government have increased to a great extent.
So that the needy, poor families in the rural areas can be brought above the poverty line and their poverty can be removed. For this, it is expected to plan keeping in mind the family focus.
Mechanisms should be taken at the micro level in the villages and towns so that the participation of every family is ensured and the participation of every farm in the villages is ensured. When we look at other states under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, it is seen that smaller states like Telangana and Andhra Pradesh generate at least five times the labour budget of Maharashtra and receive more funds from the central government every year.
Maharashtra being the parent state of the Employment Guarantee Scheme, automatically we have a moral responsibility. That is, more and more man-days should be created in the state so that the people of rural areas get employment, not only this employment will create wealth, the poor of rural areas will have a comfortable life, they will reach the path of wealth and become millionaires and the purpose of the law at the state and central level will be successful in the true sense.
In view of all the above and the instructions given by the Central Government in Reference No. 8. Details of time-bound activities as per Form A is attached. All districts should follow this.
The order will come into effect immediately.
