3. It has come to the notice of the Government that the development works undertaken under the Tirtha Kshetra Development Plan have not been completed within the stipulated time as the land acquisition process has not been completed on time. Also, the delay in land acquisition leads to a huge increase in the price of land. As a result, the total estimated cost of the pilgrimage development plan increases. In order to avoid such incidents, if land acquisition is required to be done before starting development works under Shri Kshetra Bhimashankar Teerth Kshetra Development Plan, the Divisional Commissioner, Pune/ Collector Pune should complete the process of land acquisition on priority and such development works should be started only after land acquisition.
4. Under the Shri Kshetra Bhimashankar Tirtha Kshetra Development Plan for the year 2018-19, Rs. The works which can be completed in a year with a fund of Rs. 15.40 crore should be taken up on priority. Appropriate measures should also be taken to prevent" Thin Spreading of Financial Resources."
The actual expenditure under the head of accounts and the expenditure reported by the Office of the Principal Accountant General, Mumbai, in each financial year from 2018-19 to 2021-22 under the Shri Kshetra Bhimashankar Teerth Kshetra Development Plan should be reconciled. The utilization certificate of the disbursed funds should be submitted to the government immediately.
This Government decision is based on the circular of the Finance Department No. 2018/ No. 69/ Finance-3, dated April 2, 2018, as well as the Finance Department Informal Reference No. 245/2018/ Expenditure-8, dated 18.8.2018.
