circular
As per the guidelines of the Central Government, the ratio of unskilled, skilled under MGNREGA is to be maintained at 60:40 at the district level. However, it has been observed that most of the officers and employees strive to maintain a 60:40 ratio at every work level. As a result, the ratio of the state in the last few years has remained as follows:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| A. No. | Year    | Total expenditure (in crore) | Cost of living (%) | Cost efficiency (%) | Total available skilled funds (in crore) |
| 1      | 2017-18 | 2294.83                      | 1562.99 (73)       | 606.13 (27)         | 261.51                                   |

Also, in the above case, District wise Table Annexure No. is given in 1. In the future, such a chart will be brought to the notice of the District Collector every month. The MIS Coordinator/ Project Coordinator of the respective district will also be present. District Collector and brought to the notice of the Chief Executive Officer (GP).
According to the SECC survey, a total of 44 lakh families in the state of Maharashtra are below the poverty line. Only 2 lakh families are eligible for MNREGA benefits. This means that the family's financial situation is not good. However, not all families are willing to work for MNREGA. They all need to be enriched. The MNREGA scheme is currently being implemented in the state.

It's not popular. This could mean that it needs to be improved.
There are about 91 lakh job card holders in the state, out of which only 32 lakh are active job card holders.
The place of origin of Rohyo thought is Maharashtra state. However, MGNREGA funds are being used more by other states. In Maharashtra, schemes like MNREGA are being implemented for almost 50 years.
Still other states have been able to generate more number of man days per family below poverty line than our own state. In this regard, the state of Maharashtra is seen at 20% compared to the country's average. This is only 6% more than in some developed countries. Other states have also been able to reduce the percentage of people below the poverty line as they have used more funds under this scheme. For example, in Andhra Pradesh, the percentage of people living below the poverty line is half that of Maharashtra and the number of such people is only 45 lakh as compared to the population of 2 crore 13 lakh in Maharashtra.
In such a situation, there is a need to strictly implement the schemes of MNREGA in a planned manner so that more funds under MNREGA in the state of Maharashtra can be used every year to help more families prosper. For this, the following action plans should be implemented:
60:40 ratio: The demand for individual work in the state is very structured. People seem to be more inclined towards the demand for gunny bags and wells. However, more vermi-compost/ nadap compost needs to be made from animal dung/ dung to earn more money per drop from the use of well water.
Also, if the ratio is not 60:40, then it is necessary to take the orchard. All these tasks can be done in the ratio of 60:40 if they are considered together for family or groups.
For this, the MGNREGA Commissioner has prepared an Excel sheet. The link is https:// docs. google. com/ spreadsheets/ d/ 1bLRZJr62h9Ftd9TWFOQBIORL7PYYsJnqBUJ093p _ sXE/ edit? The usp is sharing. All the MIS coordinators should train all the APOs, PTOs, CDEOs and Gram Rozgar Sevaks regarding its use. Similarly, all BDOs, Dy. The CEO, Dy. Collectors should also be trained.
If such action is taken, it will be possible to carry out the necessary and demanding works in the state on a large scale like water supply roads, godowns, gram panchayat buildings, anganwadis, godowns, school beautification etc.
Providing more benefits to more job card holders: More funds should be used every year to carry out a large number of works. More funds can be made available to the state if both the state and the central government provide it together. If wages are paid within 100 days for each job card, the central government's 10 per cent fund and the central government's 90 per cent fund are used. However, if wages are paid for more than 100 days, the state government has to bear 100 per cent of the cost. Therefore, the state

Considering the fact that the funds are spent on a large scale, planning is necessary so that each job card does not require more than 100 days of wages. Though the work of wells, farms, etc. is individual, over the years, other job card holders continue to help the beneficiaries. In this way, wages can be made available to other job card holders for up to 100 days for personal work.
2.1 Individual work: 100 days wages: Under MGNREGA, if a family needs to do 5-6 individual works to prosper, it should be given. However, in personal work, any job card holder is allowed 100 days of wages in a year. If you need more than 100 man-days to complete individual tasks, seek the help of other job card holders, such as wells.
The aim is to make every family in the state prosperous. If necessary, groups of 5-6 or 8-10 families should be considered. In this way, each family can be given 5 to 6 or 8 to 10 works.
Each family must complete a task each year. All these things have to be done together. In this way, all the work of everyone will be completed in 5-6 or 8-10 years. He will achieve the 60:40 ratio and within 100 days, wages and prosperity for all families will be achieved simultaneously. See the example in Appendix B.
2.2 Public Works: 100 Days Labour: 2.2.1 Whether the work is individual or public, if more job card holders work, any work can be completed within 100 days. But for this, more people in the village should prepare job cards. Also, work will be recorded on the job card of more and more people while working. That is, it should be ensured that more families get work. Also, public facilities are available in the village.
2.2.2 However, some activities such as tree plantation/ nursery are carried out throughout the year. Some states like Telangana have also used groupism for such public works.
If a job takes 1300 man-days per year, it is completed by a group of 13 job card holders. No job card is issued for more than 100 days.
2.3 Providing more than 100 days of work in public works to needy job card holders: While the Central Government has guaranteed 100 days of employment to the members of a family in the MGNREGA Act, the Maharashtra Government has enacted a law guaranteeing more than 100 days of employment to the needy. Only those who require more than 100 days of employment should be employed in public works. However, the No. As mentioned in 2.2.2, they can be given work for a year without paying more than 100 days' wages on any job card. like digging a well 10

12 people can work together. People help to complete the work in the well. So here people will help to complete the duration.
3.1 MGNREGA Act, 2005 has given every adult member of a family the right to ask for a job card with the address of the house and the name of the person to be included.
Also, any adult in any household will have the right to ask for work and the government will be responsible for providing them work within 15 days. The main objective of the MNREGA is to provide food security and improve livelihoods. So if there are too many adult names in a job card, it will be difficult to achieve both these goals. If more than one person is working on a job card in a day, the information can be extracted from NAREGASOFT. If more than two people are found working in it, then that job card should be separated. Also, if two people are working and they are not husband and wife, then there may be a need for separation of that job card. For this, the job cards should be separated by making inquiries.
If people of a family are entitled to additional ration cards due to marriage of children or divorce of spouse or other reasons, they should be given additional job cards by separating the job cards without waiting for the issuance of new ration cards.
In any case, the job card should be issued on the condition that no more than two people will work on one job card. This will benefit a large number of families.
3.2 Single women:- To provide job cards and 100 days of wages to women who qualify as households as per the Migraorahyo Act, identifying widows, abandoned and destitute women during the Corona period. By doing this, a large number of jobs can be given to the needy people every year. The ratio will be 60:40. Also, with the availability of more number of job cards, more number of families can be included in MGNREGA by providing 100 days of work on each job card. The same number of families can also be made prosperous.
