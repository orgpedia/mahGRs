PROPOSAL The heavy rainfall and flood situation in the state during the Kharif season 2025 has led to the destruction of arable land in some districts and the standing crops in the fields have also been destroyed or washed away. As a result, it has been observed that the condition of farmers has been adversely affected. In such a situation, it is necessary to enable farmers to earn income from such land by immediately repairing and making the farm land arable. Agricultural land is permissible to be arable through repair / levelling of fallow / wasteland as per Reclamation of Degraded / Waste Land (No.59) in the list of works permissible under MGNREGA. Accordingly, the government was considering empowering small and marginal farmers (up to a maximum of 2 hectares) by making agricultural land more arable with permissible soil-storage activities under the MGNREGA scheme. Accordingly, the government is taking the following decisions.
Government Decision: This Government Decision approves the repair / cultivability of agricultural land of small and marginal farmers (maximum limit 2 hectares) through soil-storage activities permissible under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme for agricultural land damaged due to heavy rains or floods.

a) The job card holder under MGNREGA scheme will be eligible for these personal benefit activities such as repairing / cultivating the above mentioned agricultural land.
b) Families of small and marginal farmers who do not have access to a job card and meet other eligibility conditions / conditions should join the scheme by providing a job card.
