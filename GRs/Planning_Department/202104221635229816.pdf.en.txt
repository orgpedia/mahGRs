Every household in the village has to dig a well to drain out the waste water.
On an average, 5 persons in a family use 40 litres of water per person.
A total of 200 liters per day per household used, at least 72,000 liters of water annually
That's 7 tanks of 10,000 liters. If there are 100 families in the village, 700 tankers of water are supplied every year.

100% recycling of water through suckers
Mr. Dattatraya Ware, Headmaster, International Zilla Parishad School, Wablewadi, Taluka Shirur, District Pune.
Our house is in rural area. Nature has provided us with all the resources. It is easy to get the blessings of nature in the form of pure air, abundant water, trees, fertile soil etc. but it is a difficult task to preserve these blessings.
There are 7 people in our family. A thousand gallons of water are needed every day. A water tank was installed in front of the house. But there was no water. So he took another borewell at the back of the house and got enough water. A thousand litres of water is used every day for cooking, drinking, bathing, clothing and animal husbandry. Too much water after use

It had to be left as a waste. This was always on my mind.
Initially, the water from the kitchen and bathroom was collected through a pipeline and a pit was dug twenty feet near the first borewell and a suction pit of Nanded pattern was made in it and released into it. The water from the animal's cage was released into it by taking another simple stone brick suction pit on the opposite side of the suction pit. All the water used in the house was now going into these two suckers and being buried in the ground.
A few days later, water was found in the well.
After asking the knowledgeable people it was found that after releasing the waste water from the suction pits into the ground, it helps in reducing the temperature of the ground level. As a result, the water vapor in the soil also gets converted into water. That is, the water that we leave in the suckers forms more water when it enters the soil. We started drawing water by putting a solar-powered pump in the borewell. The borewell was naturally purified and cleaned as the water had seeped into the ground from twenty feet. This water was sufficient for our garden, animals and other uses.
The water was pumped out of the well. He had broken open the locked gate. We started getting more water than we were releasing in the suckers.
6. New DSR or wage rate for manufacture of individual suckers, group suckers shall be as per notified and as per reference No. 2 here. New budgets should be prepared from time to time as mentioned in March 30, 2021.
