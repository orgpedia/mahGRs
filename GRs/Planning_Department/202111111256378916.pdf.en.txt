No.26/ ROHYO-10A dated 30th March, 2021
Preamble: Due to the availability of less manpower in agriculture and due to mechanization, sowing, intercropping, harvesting, threshing and other works in agriculture are being done through machines and because agriculture needs perennial farm roads for transporting agricultural goods to the market and for transporting the machinery to the farm, and since the farm roads are not included in the scheme, it was decided to implement the" Guardian Minister's Farm/ Panand Road Scheme" in the state through convergence of various schemes under the Government Decision dated 27.2.2018 at No. 1, Wacha. Also read: The scheme has been amended from time to time as per the Government Corrigendum No. 2 to 5.
Considering the technical difficulties faced during the actual implementation of the scheme and the quality of the roads to be built in the scheme has not been defined, the problem of the road is not solved permanently despite the work of farm roads in many places. Since the quality of the road is not defined, at some places, only soil is dumped on the road by removing encroachments. The road is wide, but becomes muddy when it rains. Also, if there is more rain, such mud roads get washed away and the effect of the work done is reduced to zero.
It is necessary to dream that every farmer and villager of the state of Maharashtra will prosper. The theme of the state is' I am prosperous, village is prosperous' and' Village is prosperous, my Maharashtra is prosperous'.

Government Resolution No: MGRRO-2021/ PR No.29/ ROHYO-10A
It is being implemented through MGR. Farm roads are just as important as other roads.
As soon as the crop is ready in the field, it should be removed and stored at the right place or sold in the market. Without roads, farmers are unable to do anything. The state has given the slogan' sell it to pickle'. No matter how economically profitable the crops grown in the rainy season are, it is not possible to think about growing them in the absence of roads. Non-availability of waterways is a major hurdle in crop diversification. This is a major factor blocking the way for the richness of the farmers of the state.
That is why the farmers are demanding the construction of a road in the state. The work has been intensified in some districts of the state. Therefore, the work is going on at a slow pace. At the same time, the goal of making every rural family a lakhpati is also being achieved. In such a situation, farm/ waterways should be of high quality and usable.
Therefore, the Government Decision dated February 27, 2018 regarding the implementation of the' Guardian Minister's Farm/ Panand Road Scheme' and Read No. The matter of issuing consolidated instructions after considering all the aspects for the construction of farm/ wetland roads in a qualitative manner by validating the government certificates from 2 to 5 was under consideration. The proposal. The Cabinet has approved and the government is taking the following decisions accordingly.
Government's decision:
1. From the convergence of various schemes, to implement the" Guardian Minister Farm/ Panand Road Scheme" Read No. 1 here. Government Resolution dated 27/12/2018 and Read No. (2) They are being superseded by the governance purse at (5).
2. With a view to ensure that every farmer and every villager of the State of Maharashtra prospers, the concepts of" I am prosperous and my village is prosperous" and" Village is prosperous and my Maharashtra is prosperous" are being implemented through MGNREGA and State ROHAYO. Farm/ irrigation roads are mainly used for transporting farm implements. Due to mechanization, sowing, intercropping, harvesting, threshing and other works in agriculture are done through machines. Farm/ wetland roads should be suitable for perennial use for transportation of these machinery. As part of this, approval is being given to implement" Matoshree Gram Samruddhi Khet/ Panand Road Scheme" for construction of farm/ waterways roads of standard quality.
The following guidelines are being issued for the effective implementation of Matoshree Gram Samriddhi Khet/ Panand Road Scheme.

Government Resolution No: MGRRO-2021/ PR No.29/ ROHYO-10A
Government Decision Revenue and Forest Department No. As per Geo-assessment 1080/68/4966/ L-1, dated 4th November, 1987, the classification of rural roads is as follows:
(i) The roads running from one village to another village and the rural roads within the limits (shown in the village map with two substantial lines and the land of this road is not included in any geodetic numbering). Village Road (Village is shown in the map with a broken double line and the area through which the geodesic passes is shown as poor, such roads are registered from sixteen and a half to twenty-one feet. )
The footpaths (shown on the village map with a broken line and the width of the roads in the geometric area through which the stomach is shown as bad) are one and a half to eight feet wide. (ii) The footpaths and carriageways leading to the farm are not shown on the map. However, under Section 143 of the Constitution, the Tahsildars are empowered to decide on such roads in case of disputes. Accordingly, the roads are being laid.
(iii) Other rural roads.
Under this scheme, the following farm/ waterway works can be taken up.
(i) Strengthening of existing farm/ waterlogged roads.
(ii) Kacha and Pucca roads together by making farm/ waterway encroachment free.
All the farm/ water supply roads in the state should be constructed according to the parameters of the Public Works Department (Zilla Parishad and Government). It will only vary in width according to the availability of space. However, the height of the roads, size of the boulders, thickness of the boulder layer, drainage channels on both sides of the roads, planting of trees on the sides of the roads, quality testing, etc. should all be standardized.
6. Matoshree Gram Samruddhi Khet/ Panand Road Yojana, both MGNREGA and State ROHYO schemes have the main objective of providing unskilled employment to the needy and equally important objective of creating mass productive and basic facilities in rural areas. The funds are provided by the central government under MGNREGA. However, since the ratio of unskilled to skilled expenditure needs to be maintained at 60:40 for various works, there are difficulties in taking up works where this ratio cannot be maintained, especially road works and farm/ water works.
There is a huge demand and need for roads.
Page 3 of 16
# Page 4
Government Resolution No: MGRRO-2021/ PR No.29/ ROHYO-10A
Additional skilled funds will be made available from the State Governments to maintain 60:40 ratio of unskilled to skilled expenditure.
Under this programme, roads of the proposed quality as per the standards of the Public Works Department should be constructed as per the following model budget. However, whenever the DSR changes, the budget will change.
Farm/ water ways are as important as other highways/ roads. Therefore, it is necessary to build quality farm/ waterways. Therefore, the budget of roads with high quality should be prepared by the Public Works Department, the Zilla Parishad/ Government and the Forest Department if it is forest land and it should be given technical approval. The process of determining the parameters for construction of farm/ waterway is underway. In the meantime, the parameters prescribed by the Rural Development Department for construction of rural roads will continue to be applicable.
While strengthening the farm/ panand kutcha road, the chars should be dug from both sides and the soil/ pus coming out of it should be put in the area between the farm/ panand road and it should be properly pressed with a roller. If the road section is passing through black soil, then a hard pimple of at least 300 mm thickness should be put on the filler and it should be properly pressed by sprinkling water with a roller. Considering the local geographical situation, if a pucca road is to be prepared for perennial use after mooring, then such a pucca road should be constructed otherwise it is necessary to make a gravel on the moor. The total thickness of the stone used for this should be 225 mm, out of which the thickness of the bottom layer stone should be 150 mm. The size of the road should be according to the Rural Road Manual. (75mm to 4.75 mm) and the thickness of the top layer should be 75mm with grading|| (53mm to 4.75 mm). This stone should be available from the nearby quarry. The stone should be broken into the right size and then used. After spreading the pebbles in each layer, dry it properly and then press it with a roller after hitting the water. While imaginatively using the stones/ soil/ pimples obtained from different works, the stone should be black and heavy. It should be seen that 100 percent use will be done after breaking the stone. Avoid black soil if possible. The pimple used in the filler should be hard and the pimple used for grinding up to 30% should be light.
CD Work- When building a bridge, it is advisable to use cement pipes, however, after laying the cement pipes, there should be at least M-10 concrete walls on both sides, so that the road does not get clogged and the life of the CD work is increased. Possibly the cobbled streets are enough for the Panand road Page 4 of 16
# Page 5
Government Resolution No: MGRRO-2021/ PR No.29/ ROHYO-10A
If the roads are built on gravel, they will need to be asphalted in the next 2-3 years.
Otherwise, the road will not be passable. While filling the mud pimples it is necessary to give camber from the middle of the road to both the sides. Hence, rain water will not flow on the roads.
8. Sample Budget: Taking into account the essentials mentioned in the Government decision for construction of farm/ wetland roads, i. 23,84,856.
MGNREGA- Rs. 9,02,879 MGNREGA- Skilled- Rs. 6,01,919 State Rohyo-Kushal- Rs. Total Rs 8,80,058 23,84,856 The amount of budget may vary due to local geographical conditions, distance of transportation of mules and mules etc. Also, this will change with changing the DSR.
The budget also includes the following:
Royalty- Rs. 2,04,347 GST- Rs. 1,51,627 Total- Rs. 3,55,974 i.e. Rs. 9,02,879 and Rs. 6,01,919 will be admissible from MNREGA and for supplementary skilled expenditure Rs. 8,80,058 will be made available through State ROHYO. Provision of supplementary skilled funds will be made under the head" Farm/ Waterway Scheme" and an online system will be developed to disburse funds as per demand. Or a separate link (LINK) will be made available on the existing NREGA portal.
ii) The estimated cost of one km of Muruma paved road as on date is Rs. 9,76,420/-.
MGNREGA- Rs. 7,58,683/ MNREGA Skilled- Rs. 2,17,737/ Total- Rs. 9,76,420/ Page 5 of 16

Government Resolution No: MGRRO-2021/ PR No.29/ ROHYO-10A
If the road works are being done by providing funds both through combination and circulation, then there is no need to send a proposal to the government for approval of the plan regarding those roads. Also, administrative approval of such works should be done as per the prevailing procedure.
22. Creation of kutcha roads by making farm/ water ways encroachment free.
Wherever the farmer agrees, the land should be properly planned with the help of earthmover excavator and the soil/ pimple coming out of it should be put in the area between the farm/ waterlogged road. Also, the mud/ mud dug up in the pasture should be spread properly and the raw fill of the roads should be prepared. To construct such an unpaved road, backhoe loaders and excavators with tyres (earthmovers like JCB etc. with a capacity of more than 70 HP) will be allowed at 100 hours per kilometer and excavators with chains (earthmovers like Poclain etc. with a capacity of more than 200 HP) at 40 hours per kilometer. If it takes more hours per kilometer than this, the approval of the Taluk Level Committee will be required.
The width of the filling of the farm/ waterway should be sufficient while preparing the kutcha road by making the farm/ waterway encroachment free. At least two vehicles should be in the convoy.
The width of the trench should be at least 3.00 m. Also, the width of the trench should be such that rainwater flows properly through the trench.
Mechanism of expenditure of funds for construction of kutcha roads: (i) Eviction of encroachments, construction of kutcha roads and other works should be done by excavators.
For this, funds from various sources will be utilised. Excavation machinery (JCB, Poclain, etc.) should be used for removal of encroachments, digging of chars on both sides, laying of kutcha roads from the soil available from the chars, etc. Rates per hour (including machinery and fuel) should be fixed at the taluk level to ensure availability of these excavators. Priority should be given to the local excavator. How many cubic meters will be mined per hour in general should be considered.
(ii) The following procedure shall be followed for payment of excavators used for removal of encroachments and laying of kutcha roads:- The Gram Sevak and Talathi shall jointly certify the number of hours the excavators were actually used for removal of encroachments and" laying of kutcha roads." encroachments on the road
Page 16 of 13
# Page 14
Government Resolution No: MGRRO-2021/ PR No.29/ ROHYO-10A
It has been said that the farmers adjacent to the farm should be attached with the panchnama regarding the actual hours of use of the excavator. The payment should be made by the competent authority by issuing the certificate of hourly use of the excavator (jointly signed by the Gram Sevak and the Talathi) and the farmer's panchnama. No other measurements are required. The payment pattern will be issued separately.
(iii) To construct such a road, backhoe loader and excavator with tyres (JCB etc., earthmovers with capacity more than 70 HP) will be allowed at 100 hours per kilometre or excavator with chain (Poklen etc., earthmovers with capacity more than 200 HP) at 40 hours per kilometre. If it takes more hours per kilometer than this, the approval of the Taluk Level Committee will be required.
(iv) At some places, mud is available from both sides of the chars while laying the kutcha road. The farmers also provide stones and mud for the roads. In such places, the farmer asks for a road roller to bury the pimples and stones available, which helps in paving the kutcha road. Considering this, the district level committee should fix the per hour rate and per kilometre maximum cost limit (including machinery and fuel) of the roadroller by pouring water on the pressure. The procedure for expenditure of funds for the machinery Roadroller shall be as per the procedure for expenditure of funds for excavator machinery mentioned in paragraph (i) (ii) above. The cost incurred for the Roadroller shall be in addition to the cost allowable for the excavator.
v) The District Level Committee shall work out the modalities for providing diesel to the places where excavators, roadrollers, stone pelting machinery are available free of cost through CSR/ NGOs. Funding for diesel under Para No. be made available from the permissible scheme mentioned in section 21.
(vi) Some funds from the State RoHYO will be earmarked for removal of encroachments in farm/ panand roads and will be allocated taluk wise at the beginning of the year. In this way, the encroachments should be cleared and a kutcha road should be constructed. After this, the work of strengthening the road should be taken up immediately considering the next phase of the road works.
(vii) Use of available stones/ mud/ soil for construction of farm/ water ways. For this, stones/ pebbles from the irrigation wells running under various schemes of the government should be used if available. Implementing agencies should use stones/ mud/ soil available from various works for road strengthening in an imaginative manner.
