Last year, the school was closed for students.
Over the past year, efforts have been made to reach education to every child through various means, but due to the closure of schools, children have been sitting at home for a year and due to physical and mental stress on them, this matter should not be ignored. It will be difficult to recover this loss if the school remains closed for a long time. Last year, due to the long lockdown, the teaching and learning process was disrupted.
This is likely to lead to large-scale social harm such as increased child marriage, child labour, dropout rate of girls/ boys, etc. Therefore, the matter of starting classes from 1st to 4th standard in Covid-free areas and issuing detailed guidelines in accordance with the safety of the students in the ashramshala was under the consideration of the government so that the students could get the benefit of regular education.
Government Decision: Considering the background mentioned in the Preamble, the Government is approving the opening of Government and Aided Ashramshalas and Eklavya Model Residential Schools from 15th December, 2021 in COVID free areas of the State.
The decision to start classes from 1st to 4th should be discussed with the parents.
(2) Since the characteristics of the Ashramshalas of the Tribal Development Department at the Gram Panchayat level are different (residential nature, students from different villages, some of them are day-scholars), the decision to start the school should be taken together with the concerned Project Office and the local administration. However, the final decision will be taken by the officials.
(3) No Covid patient should be found in the village for at least one month before the school starts.
(4) The teaching work of the teachers in the ashramshala who have completed at least one dose of vaccination. Teachers who have not completed at least 1 dose should get vaccinated immediately.
(5) The concerned project officer shall provide vaccination facilities for teachers and non-teaching staff in coordination with the District Collector and District Health Officer.
(6) If the teaching and non-teaching staff have not taken at least one dose of vaccine within 15 days from the issuance of the government decision, such employees should be sent on leave without pay. After the vaccination certificate is issued, the child must be enrolled in school.
(7) The instructions issued by the School Education Department from time to time in the context of the curriculum should be followed. The School Education Department, No. Page 2 of 15
