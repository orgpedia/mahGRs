Preamble: Large-scale leopard collection is carried out in some tribal areas of the state. The leopard was initially collected by the forest department under the Maharashtra Minor Forest Produce (Regulation of Trade) Act, 1969 (1). Thereafter, on 19.08.2014, Ma. As per the notification issued by the Governor, Tendu and Kendu leaves were also included in the minor forest produce and the Gram Sabha and Gram Panchayats were empowered to collect all kinds of minor forest produce. Further, the Gram Sabha has the powers to take action for the sale of tendu leaves as per the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 and Rules 2008 and Amendment Rules, 2012.
Bamboo is an important component of forestry. The collection of this tendu is about 5 to 7 lakh standard bangs in Maharashtra every year. This collection provides employment to about five lakh tribal families every year. The Project Officer, Integrated Tribal Development Project, Dharani through Group of Gram Sabha, Th. Achalpur, G. Amravati, has received a proposal for financial assistance as playing capital for tendu collection and management as a matter of urgency during the COVID lockdown. In the absence of this financial assistance, about 6 to 7 thousand tribal families in 45 gram sabhas will have to face severe financial crisis.
In view of the above situation, since the collection and sale of tendu leaves is an important means of livelihood for tribal families, the matter of providing working capital to the respective Gram Sabhas for the collection and management of tendu leaves through Gram Panchayats was under consideration of the Government.
