Government circular:
The Maha DBT Portal was launched for sanction of scholarships in 2017-18, but due to technical difficulties in the same, the allotment of scholarships could not be done. Therefore, it was decided in December, 2017 to accept applications for scholarship/ tuition fee reimbursement under Tribal Development Department for the academic year 2017-18 through online computer system" e-Vikas." The approval of applications is being processed by examining the scholarship applications after examining the documents and the findings of the Special Investigation Team regarding the previous irregularities in the allocation of scholarships/ tuition fee reimbursement. However, it has been observed that a large number of applications are still pending at the college level and considering the time taken to scrutinize the applications now that the last few days of the financial year are over, it is not possible to credit the amount of scholarship, tuition fee/ examination fee to the students account before the end of March, 2018 after scrutinizing all the applications. However, the educational institutions have not received the tuition fees, examination fees, etc. throughout the year. Considering these aspects, instructions are being given to take the following actions so that the funds distributed for scholarships, tuition fees and examination fees do not go waste.
Post Matric Scholarship for the year 2017-18 Rs. 168.09 crore has been sanctioned under the head 2225 2282. 108.85 crore has been disbursed. The funds allocated from the Central share of this disbursed fund as well as the funds allocated under sub-heading TT240034 and TT240035 for the State share of Post Matric Scholarship under District Annual Tribal Component Programme and the funds allocated under sub-heading TT240036 for Tuition Fee Reimbursement Scheme are being approved at the level of Project Officer as a special case.
