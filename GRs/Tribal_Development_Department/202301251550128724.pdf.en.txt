These schemes are implemented by the Tribal Development Department through the Regional Offices functioning under the jurisdiction of the Department such as Commissionerate of Tribal Development, Nashik, Tribal Research and Training Institute, Pune, Shabari Tribal Finance and Development Corporation, Nashik.
