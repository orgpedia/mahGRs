The Proposal:
Thakkar Bappa Tribal Habitat Improvement Scheme to provide infrastructure facilities to the habitations/ villages of Scheduled Tribes in urban and rural areas of the State. It was being implemented at the district level as per the provisions of June 26, 2007. However, since the State level scheme of" 5% grant to Gram Panchayats in Pesa area" has been transferred under the District Plan as per the Government Circular dated 20.01.2021 issued by the Tribal Development Department regarding District Annual Tribal Utilization for the year 2021-22, the scheme of" Thakkar Bappa Tribal Habitat Improvement" has been transferred to the State level from the year 2021-22 to reduce the district level liabilities. Considering this, the Tribal Development Department proposes to implement the revised guidelines of" Thakkar Bapa Tribal Habitat Improvement Scheme" from 2022-23 by revising the works to be taken under this scheme, the implementation mechanism and other criteria by approving the works to be suggested for the development of the habitations/ villages in the rural areas of the Scheduled Tribes in the state from the government level.
