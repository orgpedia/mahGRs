Read: 1. Planning Department (ROHYO) Government Resolution No. Mgraro-2022/ Q.No.174/ Rohyo-6A, Dy. 14/12/2022 2. Department of Planning (ROHYO) Proposal dated 16/01/2023 3. Planning Department (ROHYO) Government Resolution No.Magrarohyo-2010/ No. 47/ ROHYO-10, D. 13/04/2023 Preamble-
In the context of the decision of the Government in Article No. 1 of the Plan (Rohyo Ward), the Government has implemented the Facilitated Family Mission and the Comprehensive Village Prosperity Plan through the convergence of the MGNREGA and the schemes of various departments. This scheme is meant for the development of tribal families and society in the state.
In the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) 2021 released by NITI Aayog, one-third weightage has been given to each of the disadvantaged groups related to health, education and living standards.
Despite the implementation of various schemes by the government, the rate of deprivation among the tribal community in the state is high. Though a large number of unskilled work is done under MGNREGA in the tribal-dominated Melghat and Palghar areas of the state, a large number of tribal hamlets, villages, wadis and hamlets remain unconnected by perennial roads in these areas. In both these areas, every year some of the skilled funds of MNREGA remain unutilized. Therefore, it is possible to connect 100% tribal hamlets, villages, wadi settlements in the tribal areas in the next few years by converging the funds of such unused skilled funds and rural roads of the Tribal Development Department.
Migration is high in the tribal areas of the state. He will ask him to
If the work is carried out on this principle, the old age and geographical isolation of the tribal society

Due to various reasons, they are likely to go to work wherever they can get it by self-determination without demanding work from the government. Therefore, in many tribal-dominated areas, there is a high rate of migration despite a large number of works under MGNREGA. There is migration in other areas but not much work is done under MNREGA. In such areas, two main reasons are given for the workers not being present in the MNREGA works and leaving the area. In addition to providing employment under MGNREGA, employment in a planned manner in conjunction with other objectives of MGNREGA such as creating sustainable productive output and strengthening the livelihood of the poor will eliminate the need for them to migrate to areas they do not like if their per capita income in a few years exceeds that of urban workers.
State level/ District level to various Administrative Departments through Tribal Development Department
Funds are allocated for the implementation of various schemes. Some of these schemes are implemented by the Tribal Development Department. The government is taking the following decisions after considering all the relevant aspects to improve the living standards of tribal families by converging the schemes of two departments- Tribal Development Department and MGNREGA.
Government's decision:
As per the revised vision of MGNREGA, the following steps should be taken to provide more employment to the tribal families of the state.
Every village should be treated as a unit. Every village should be developed in a ten-year plan. Also, the overall development of tribal hamlets, villages, wadis and hamlets should be done in a time-bound manner.
While converging the schemes, to provide benefits to the farmers/ beneficiaries under MGNREGA from the permissible items under MGNREGA such as wells, orchards, trees on bunds, vermi compost, gunny bags, NADEP etc.
The following items such as cows, buffaloes, goats, hens, pump, solar pump, electricity connection and drip irrigation etc. should be provided by the Tribal Development Department to the concerned administrative department from the supplementary fund to be provided for the scheme.
Thus, the government should provide all the fixed and movable allowances required to earn income to a family.
To maintain 60:40 ratio of unskilled and skilled expenditure while executing any work under MNREGA, adequate skilled funds will be made available through convergence of schemes of Tribal Development Department.
