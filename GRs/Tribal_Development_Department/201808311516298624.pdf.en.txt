Based on the information in the Government Sanitary No. Kendriya-2017/ S. 64/ K. 19, efforts will be made to bring the malnourished children out of malnutrition. Also, the reduction in malnutrition will also be shown on the web portal.
(e) Triangulation of information in respect of Bharat Ratna Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Amrit Aahar Scheme-
Information regarding the experience of the beneficiaries of Bharat Ratna Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Amrit Aahar Yojana will be collected regularly. Selected people through ASHA/ Village Workers (e.g. 8 people- 2 Pregnant Mothers, 2 Lactating Mothers, 2 Parents of children below 6 years, 2 Village Health Committee/ Mother Committee Members) will be taken every month through Mobile SMS/ App. Triangulation of this information will be done every three months at the taluka and district level.
Information on the Integrated Child Development Scheme as well as data coming from the Community Action for Nutrition process from the village level will be examined together. An investigation will be done and action will be taken accordingly.
For this, the Tribal Development Department at the Taluka, District and State level needs to coordinate in the context of triangulation in line with the Amrit Aahar scheme. The meetings to be held every three months in connection with the triangulation should be organized by the Project Officer/ Assistant Project Officer of the Tribal Development Department. Based on this triangulation, it will be possible for the Tribal Development Department to take measures regarding the scheme. If the model is successful, the experiment can be universalized in 16 tribal districts.
A mobile app will be used to collate this information at the Anganwadi and village level and through the portal, this information will be collected at the taluka and state level and it will be analyzed at the taluka and state level. The mobile app will have criteria to identify high-risk pregnant women.
The criteria for identifying high risk pregnant women are as follows: Pre-cesarean or uterine surgery Very low height- less than 4 feet 10 inches/ Very low weight below 147 cm/ Very high weight- less than 40 kg/ more than 80 kg (No weight gain or very high gain during pregnancy means> 3 kg per month) Pre-term abortion or pre-term infant death Diabetes twins, pregnancy after repeated attempts- treated for pregnancy, infertility prevention (Previous H/ O Habitual Abortion/ Stillbirth age after 35 years)

- Defects in HIV/ AUS antigen/ thyroid/ liver/ kidney less than 8 g Symptoms of pre-eclampsia (high blood pressure, swelling of limbs, weight gain, protein in urine) Excessive vomiting from the 4th month of pregnancy (2nd trimester onwards).
The objectives of the project are as follows: Community Action for Nutrition project will create awareness about Bharat Ratna Dr. Abdul Kalam Amrit Aahar Yojana. For effective implementation of AMRUT scheme, Village Health, Nutrition, Water Supply and Sanitation Committees, Aahar Committees and Mother Committees will be activated in the project area.
Under the scheme, the enrolment of pregnant and lactating mothers and children will be increased to 90 per cent and the intake of food to 80 per cent. A public participation based data collection model will be developed to track the status of the scheme. On this basis, the information of the beneficiaries of the Amrit Aahar Yojana will be available to the Tribal Development Department village-wise and after this project, it will be possible to make this model universal in all tribal districts in the next period.
The project aims to reduce acute and moderate malnutrition in children by 20%.
Moderate undernutrition is defined as severe wasting (low weight for height, below-3 z score) and/ or severe underweight (low weight for age, below-3 z score).
The rate of growth faltering in children under six years of age will be reduced by 25 percent. The rate of improvement in children in the acute and moderate category will be increased to 25 per cent. Child mortality related to malnutrition will be reduced by 15 percent.
Access to referral services for malnourished children who need referral services will be increased to 50 per cent. The outcome depends on the project assumptions. The Tribal Development Department will take the initiative to ensure active cooperation of Public Health Department and Women and Child Development Department for effective implementation and outcome of the project.
4. At the village level, the following activities will be carried out in coordination with Anganwadi workers, ASHAs and health workers through public participation regarding nutrition services and habits:- At the village level, awareness will be created about nutrition services (Bharat Ratna Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Amrit Aahar Yojana and Anganwadi Seva Yojana). On the basis of this public awareness- village health, nutrition, water supply and

Government Sanitary No: Kendriya-2017/ S.No.64/ K.N.19 Sanitation Committee, Under AMRUT AHAAR Scheme- AHAAR SAMITI, AND I. Under the CDS, a joint meeting of the Mothers Committee will be held every month.
In this meeting, information will be given about nutrition services (Bharat Ratna Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam Amrit Aahar Yojana and Anganwadi Seva Yojana).
The issues raised by the people of the village regarding nutrition services will be discussed with the Anganwadi worker, and efforts will be made to resolve the issues related to these two services.
The issues raised at the village level will be recorded through a village service calendar. This calendar will be used for follow-up. The issues raised at the Taluka, District and State level will be recorded and will be taken up at the respective levels (Taluka, District and State), efforts will be made to resolve them.
Through ASHA workers, information will be taken from the selected beneficiaries directly regarding the Amrit Aahar scheme. This will be done at the district, taluk and state levels. The issues raised at various levels will be discussed and efforts will be made to resolve the issues.
All children under the age of 6 in the village will be subjected to anthropometry (physical measurement) at the beginning of the project. Anthropometry of the newly registered child will be recorded in the Anganwadi. Weighing of children registered in anganwadis every month and measuring their height every 6 months will be carried out. The work will be carried out through Anganwadi workers and ASHA/ Village workers with the participation of the mother of the child, mother committee and village health committee members.
• The measurement of Mid Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) will be done through the hope of the children left out of Anganwadi registration through MUAC tape. This action will make it easier to measure the amount of wasting in children.
Follow-up action to eliminate malnutrition in malnourished children- Basic CAN will be conducted through ASHAs/ village functionaries to counsel the parents of malnourished children in the villages about the diet in the meetings to be held in Anganwadis. Every month, the weight of the children registered in the Anganwadi will be taken, and the children who need health care, the referral service will be provided with the help of the Anganwadi worker. Follow-up in this regard will be done through ASHA/ Village Activists.
Children in Intensive CAN villages will see a decline in nutrition levels. Special attention will be given to them by ASHA/ village workers, they will be given house visits. Anthropometry of the child will be conducted through ASHA/ village worker. The ASHAs/ village functionaries will focus on the nutrition of the child falling in the nutrition category to prevent him from becoming malnourished and to improve the nutrition habits of the child at home. Also, the ASHA/ village worker will try to provide referral services by identifying the need for immediate medical care along with food.
Counseling with the child's family on health, hygiene and nutrition habits, diet tips, telling and performing various recipes of nutritious food, etc.

Government Sanitation Number: Kendriya-2017/ Q. No.64/ Q. 19 will be implemented during the house visits by ASHA/ Village Workers. The ASHA/ village worker will help the concerned family to overcome malnutrition in the child.
The activities that can be implemented in the village for the nutrition of children, pregnant and lactating mothers, adolescent girls, etc., from the various funds available at the village level (e.g. The ASHAs/ village functionaries will try to hold discussions in the Gram Sabha regarding distribution of iron tablets to adolescent girls through the Public Health Department, family planning lectures, parsabag cultivation, stopping the practice of child marriage, etc.
Providing a list of at-risk mothers to the Tribal Development Department every month- The Tribal Development Department and the Health Department should hold a meeting together to prepare a list of criteria to identify at-risk mothers. (An ANM can check for hemoglobin, blood pressure, and oblique baby measurements.) Health workers are expected to report at-risk mothers based on the criteria for at-risk mothers that these departments have worked out together. Once this entry is made in the register of the health worker, this information can be sent to various levels through the ASHA worker.
• Under the Community Action for Nutrition project, various components at the village level (e.g. The Public Health Department, Women and Child Development Department and Tribal Development Department will issue appropriate government orders and instructions to coordinate ASHA, Anganwadi and health workers). Also, the concerned officers and employees will have to be actively involved in the process of community action for nutrition.
