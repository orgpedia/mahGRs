Madam Cama Marg, Hutatma Rajguru Chowk,
Mantralaya, Mumbai 400 032
Date: 25/01/2021
Reference: 1) Central Government Circular No. NH- 24028/14/2014-H (Vol-II), dt. February 9, 2016 2) S.B. Department, Government Resolution No. Scheme-2016/ PR No.165/ Planning-1A dated 29th November, 2016
The Proposal:
To facilitate the students of Scheduled Tribes to pursue primary, secondary, higher secondary and higher education, the Tribal Development Department is implementing Tribal Area Appropriation
The Government Ashramshala and Hostel Scheme is implemented in the tribal sub-plan area and tribal sub-plan outlying areas. Under this scheme, tribal government ashramshalas and government hostels are functioning at various places at taluk, district and division levels.
At present, there are 502 government ashramshalas and 491 government hostels in the state. Some of the government ashramshalas and hostels are functioning in government buildings and some in rented buildings. A total of 59 government ashramshalas and 321 government hostels are running in rented buildings in the state. If government land is available in this place, construction can be started by approving the budget. The government land is available at 24 places for government ashramshalas and 126 places for hostels.
The main difficulty for the construction of the government hostel and ashramshala building is the limitation of the lack of funds for new construction to be approved every year, including the site.
The remaining cost of the budget works as on 31st March of each year will be deducted from the proposed annual provision in the next year and works costing 1.5 times the balance amount will be taken up.

It is subject to administrative approval. This restricts the approval of new works from the available provision.
4. Large number of roads for overall development of roads in the State so that new works of buildings, maintenance of those buildings can be done with the available funds.
For improvement, the government is considering to implement the Hybrid Annuity Scheme for the construction of government ashramshalas/ hostel buildings in tribal areas on the lines of the Hybrid Annuity Model of the central government as well as the state government.

San for the construction of Ashramshalas and Hostels in the tribal areas of the State
From 2021-22 onwards, for the construction of roads, on the basis of the Hybrid Annuity Model of the Central Government and the State Government, where government land is available at present and without administrative approval.
