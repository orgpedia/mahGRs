Preamble to the Union Budget No. 1 here. As per the Government Decision dated 21st June, 2013, innovative schemes which are not included in the Budget or Centrally Sponsored Schemes are implemented where the schemes are required on the ground for tribal development or welfare. In the Central Budget Scheme, schemes such as Group A Income Generation or Income Augmentation Schemes, Group B Training Schemes/ Skill Development Programmes and Group C Human Resource Development and Tribal Welfare Schemes were being implemented. However, it has come to the notice of the Government that the schemes of Competitive Examination Training, Driver Training, Pre-recruitment Police Training, Skill Development implemented under various Government decisions have also been included in the training/ skill development programmes of Group B under the Union Budget Scheme. Considering this fact, the government was considering to remove Group-B and Training Schemes from the plans to be made under the scheme and to cancel the provisions of the government decision accordingly, as well as to remove the group-wise financial limit of the scheme.
Read the government's decision here. 1 The Government decision is being amended and the Group B and training schemes are being removed from the plans to be made under the Central Budget Scheme. However, the Project Offices will be allowed to implement such programmes with the approval of the Government as the Project Offices may deem necessary to implement the special training programmes for higher education keeping in view the local exigencies. However, in the relevant Government Resolution No. 7 (b) 24 shall apply. However, the procedure in respect of other schemes in the relevant Government decision shall remain the same.
