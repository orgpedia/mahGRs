The provisions of the Maharashtra Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1982 are not applicable to the employees covered under the Defined Contribution Pension Scheme/ National Pension Scheme who joined the Government service on or after 01.11.2005. Hence, they are not entitled to the benefits of pension/ family pension, death-cum-service gratuity and provident fund.
Under this scheme, the employee is paid his own contribution plus the equivalent contribution of the state government and the interest thereon at the rate of provident fund and in case of termination of the membership of the scheme, these employees are given a refund of the amount deposited in their account. In this scheme, there is no provision to invest the amount of employees in the annual plan, so no other benefits are paid to them except the amount deposited on their account.
In case of death of a member of the scheme due to short service while in service, the family of the employee does not get any benefit other than the accumulated fund deposited in his account. Therefore, with a view to financially support the families of such employees, the Department of Finance has launched a scheme for providing ex-gratia grant and benefits under the Government decision dated 29th September, 2018. On the lines of this decision, the government was considering to implement a scheme to provide ex-gratia grants and benefits to the employees of aided ashramshalas run by NGOs under the Tribal Development Department.
