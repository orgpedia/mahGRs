A development department has been set up. Currently, there are 29 departments in the department. There has been a significant increase in the work and responsibilities of the department. This includes planning, financial aspects, coordination, control, etc. of various schemes of the government for the development of tribal tribes and tribal areas. The Tribal Development Department is playing an important role in achieving the objective for which the policy of the Government has been formulated in terms of 9% share in the economic planning of the State as well as the obligation to protect the tribals.
Under the Integrated Tribal Development Project, Nagpur, the jurisdiction of Wardha and Nagpur districts and the sub-office of the project is functioning at Wardha.
