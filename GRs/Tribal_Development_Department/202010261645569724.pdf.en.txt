Government Resolution No.2020/ P.S. No.38/ BVK
Madam Cama Marg, Hutatma Rajguru Chowk,
Mantralaya, Mumbai- 400 032
Date: 26th of October 2020
The Proposal:
The PVTG tribal communities in the state are located in different tribal areas in scattered form on forest or revenue lands. The tribal families are found in a limited area and it is difficult for them to get basic amenities as these areas are in remote and undeveloped border areas. The establishment of a fixed place for the children of these families, with proper education, their health check-up and proper treatment, the supply of daily essentials like food or consumables, recreation and entertainment, and their livelihood based arrangements, etc. will promote progress with a sense of belongingness to this community. It is proposed to set up a complex for about 20,000 families. This will include the following:
Residential School (1st to 12th)- 2500 students capacity (School with hostel for boys and girls)
Health Centre/ Hospital- 100 Beds (Health Check-up and Health Diagnostic Centres)
Community Centre- 250 capacity (for entertainment, recreation, community events)
Facilitation Centres- 50 shops (livelihood support centres)
(4) Staff quarters- 200 quarters (for government employees for schools, hostels, health centres etc.)
(6) Water supply/ electrification/ solar plants/ STP/ retaining wall/ garden/ playground etc.

If the above planning is done, the government ashramshalas in the places where the required land is available can be converted into planned complexes.
If such planning is done, 7 complexes, 3 sub-committees for primitive tribes (PVTG) (Katkari, Kolam and Madia Gond) can be set up in principle.
As a pilot project, a complex for 18045 families in Palghar district is proposed. It is proposed to constitute a committee as follows to prepare and submit project proposals based on appropriate information along with feasibility report for such a complex.
Government Decision: Accordingly, a committee is being constituted to examine the feasibility of setting up a Multi-Purpose Complex for Primitive Tribes (PVTG) (Katkari, Kolam and Madia Gond) in the State of Maharashtra as follows:
