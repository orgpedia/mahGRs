Introduction: The Tribal Development Department runs Government Hostels, Government Ashramshalas, Eklavya Residential Schools to enable the students of Scheduled Tribes in the state to get education.
Various materials are supplied by the government from time to time to the students studying in these government ashramshalas, Eklavya residential schools and government hostels.
If the materials supplied to ashramshalas, hostels and other offices (Eklavya Residential Schools, Project Offices, PRTC, VTC) become useless due to the end of life and some other reasons, it is necessary to decrypt them.
The hoarding of these non-usable materials leads to some rooms in the ashramshala/ hostel remaining unutilized and also increases the presence of reptiles, mosquitoes and other insects in the area. This poses a risk to the health and safety of the students. Also, the objections raised regarding the deletion during the warehouse verification are pending for years due to the lying of useless materials and due to the non-deletion of the material at the right time, the depreciation of the material is increasing year after year, causing financial loss to the government.
