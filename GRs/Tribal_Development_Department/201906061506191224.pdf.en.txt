Introduction: In order to stop the exploitation of tribal people by money lenders and traders in tribal areas, the Maharashtra Tribal Economic Status (Amendment) Act, 1976 was passed and the moneylenders were stopped. Further, to ensure that the tribals (small land holders, landless and agricultural labourers) in the tribal sub-plan areas do not face financial difficulties due to non-availability of employment during the monsoon season (June to September) and to prevent their starvation during this period (June to September), the Khawti Loan Scheme has been launched since 1978. The scheme was being implemented by the Maharashtra State Cooperative Tribal Development Corporation Limited, Nashik. Funds for this were provided by the State Government.
The main objective of the scheme is to improve the health of the tribals, provide them with health facilities, provide them with adequate employment throughout the year under various employment related programmes, provide pure and adequate drinking water to the tribals, ensure supply of foodgrains and adequate nutrition to the tribals and enhance their active life through all these measures. A number of activities are included in the programme.
This includes a loan scheme.

Keeping in view the above situation of the tribals, during the period 2009-10 to 2013-14, Rs. 244.60 crore (Rupees Two Hundred Forty Four Crores Sixty Lakhs Only) and Rs. 116.57 crore (Rs. 361.17 crore.
