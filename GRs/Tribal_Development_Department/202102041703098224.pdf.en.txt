The funds have been distributed on the budgetary fund distribution system. Since the economic condition of the state is likely to be serious for some time to come due to the outbreak of corona virus, the controlling officer should plan and spend the funds in the prescribed manner. Only regular salary should be paid from the fund allocated for salary. No pending dues should be paid at present.
