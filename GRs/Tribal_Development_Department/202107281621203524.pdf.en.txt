Introduction: The scheduled tribe families who have land for butchering, they have got the means of income. But the landless tribal families living below the poverty line have no other means of livelihood and have to work under the employment guarantee scheme or with private persons. As a result, their lives are affected. In order to increase their sources of income and change their living conditions, it is necessary to reduce their dependence on labour and provide them with a permanent source of income, for this, under the Bhumik Poverty Line Tribals Empowerment and Swabhiman Yojana, 4 acres of Jirayat (dry) or 2 acres of Horticulture (under wet) land is provided under the decision of the relevant government. At present, land is being made available to landless tribal beneficiaries below the poverty line, taking into account the last 5 years of purchase and sale transactions in the respective areas and the prevailing Quick Estimate rates. 50 per cent of the cost of land is being provided as interest free loan and 50 per cent as subsidy.
However, in view of the increase in land prices in the last few years and with a view to extend the benefits of the scheme to a larger number of beneficiaries, the Government was considering revising the land purchase price and issuing a consolidated Government Resolution revising the guidelines of the scheme. Accordingly, the government has taken the following decision:
Government's decision
The revised consolidated guidelines are being prescribed as follows to facilitate the district level committees in the land procurement process under the Bhumik Poverty Line Tribal Empowerment and Self-Reliance Scheme by amending their jurisdiction and formalizing all the previous government decisions.

2.The committee headed by the Collector should try to buy the land as per the prevailing redirector price. If the land is not available as per the price of the ready reckoner, the land value should be negotiated with the concerned land owner. Accordingly, the cost of the radioreconner should be increased first to a maximum of 20%. However, if the land is not purchased, then it should be increased by 20% up to 100% i.e. double of the ready reckoner. However, the amount of Rs. 5.00 lakh per acre and Rs. The maximum limit is Rs 8.00 lakh.
3. In order to make available the land as above, the Collector shall review the land acquired from him earlier for the project of the Government or Government Corporation and not in use. Since a land can be used for government purposes other than the purpose for which it was acquired, the Collector should review the use of cultivable land under this scheme out of the land previously acquired but remaining for other government schemes. If the land acquired for any work has to be returned without use after five years, the Collector should ensure that the land is required by other government departments or how.
The program is 100% government funded.
5. The revised scheme is being implemented from the date of the decision of the present Government and the name of the scheme is" Bhumik Poverty Line Tribal Empowerment and Self-Reliance Scheme."
It has been found that there are various difficulties in the implementation of the pre-revised scheme, such as determining the land rate, determining the rate of land, registering the names of beneficiaries on the 7/12 line, etc. Considering the above, a sub-committee is being formed at every taluka level under the chairmanship of the revenue sub-divisional officer of the concerned taluka to assist the district level committee formed under the chairmanship of the Collector in the process of purchasing land and distributing it to the beneficiaries.
