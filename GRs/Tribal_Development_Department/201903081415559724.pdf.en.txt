The Proposal:
Under the Tribal Development Department, residential schools are run for the education of educationally backward tribals in the hilly and remote areas of the state with a view to their educational progress. Under this scheme, considering the economic weakness of the tribals, residential ashramshalas for their sons/ daughters are run by the Tribal Development Department. Since 1953-54, aided ashramshalas are being run by NGOs. At that time, the Ashramshala scheme was under the control of the School Education Department. From 1975-76, the Ashramshala scheme was being run by the Social Welfare Department.
The Tribal Development Department became independent with effect from 01.05.1983. At present, government residential ashramshalas are being run by the Tribal Development Department and subsidized residential ashramshalas by NGOs.
2. The tribal students studying in residential ashramshalas are provided free food, accommodation, bed-sheets, books, uniforms, stationery and medical facilities by the Government. The guidelines of the School Education Department were being used to run government/ aided ashramshalas. However, after the Tribal Development Department became independent, there was a need to have a separate code (manual) of the Tribal Development Department in view of the number of ashramshalas with the department, so the Government vide Government Order dated 14th September, 2001, from the academic year 2001-02, a separate code was implemented for all Government/ Aided Ashramshalas under the Department. However, as there were problems due to errors in the implementation of this code, instructions were received from the Institute Drivers' Union to publish the revised Ashramshala Code.
The government has formed a committee to look into the recommendations. The committee has amended

However, the Right of Children to Education Act 2009 was enacted in Maharashtra.
Since this law is applicable to ashramshalas, it was necessary to make changes in the code accordingly.
