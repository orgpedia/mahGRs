A total of 556 aided ashramshalas have been sanctioned under the Tribal Development Department in the state of Maharashtra and 538 aided ashramshalas are currently functioning through NGOs. In these aided ashramshalas, all the resident students belong to the tribal community.
While implementing the Ashramshala scheme for tribal students, it was observed that in many places, even after the capacity of the Ashramshalas (40 residential and 10 non-residential students in each class) is fully utilized, many non-residential students who want to study in the vicinity are not able to get admission from the Ashramshalas. Accordingly, 200 additional batches were sanctioned under the Government decision dated 02.08.2008 to the aided Ashramshalas run by NGOs under the Tribal Department. The grant-in-aid Ashramshalas, where additional batches have been sanctioned, do not have adequate facilities for additional batches and many of them are presently closed due to lack of adequate number of students. As per the report submitted by the Additional Commissioner (HQ), Tribal Development Commissionerate, Nashik vide letter dated 30.11.2022, a total of 37 additional units are presently closed.
The NGO has been repeatedly demanding that the schools be given additional batches in addition to the regular batches as a sufficient number of Scheduled Tribe students are available in the premises of their aided ashram. Accordingly, the Commissioner, Tribal Development, Nashik along with the Additional Commissioner, Tribal Development, Thane/ Nashik/ Nagpur/ Amravati
