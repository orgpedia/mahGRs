Introduction: The Government Hostel Scheme is implemented by the Tribal Development Department to facilitate the students of Scheduled Tribes to pursue higher education outside their villages. The children of Scheduled Tribes admitted in this government hostel are referred to Reference No. 1. Daily meals, snacks, milk, fruits, non-vegetarian meals etc., as per the diet menu mentioned in Annexure-A of the Government Resolution dated 10.04.2013, are supplied at the project level through the minimum rate suppliers through e-tendering process every year. Similarly, reference number 3. As per the Government decision dated 06.05.2017, the students admitted in Government Hostels are required to carry personal belongings i.e. The amount fixed for the purchase of umbrella, uniform, books, stationery, bed sheets, blankets, bedsheets, bedsheets, pillows, etc. is directly credited to their bank accounts.
At present, the government is giving a lot of emphasis on the direct benefit transfer process and has adopted the policy of depositing funds directly into the bank accounts of the beneficiaries in cash instead of the subsidy given under various welfare schemes.
All the children admitted in the government hostel are provided with food by the food vendor every day. However, since food is a matter of personal choice and tastes vary from person to person, students do not have the freedom of choice in the contractor system. There is a huge gap between the hostels in the big cities, at the divisional level and at the district level and the various educational institutions there. This causes problems for students. As a result, students in the hostel sometimes face problems like not getting food till late in the afternoon or starving. Accordingly, if the amount required for the food is directly deposited in the students' account, the students will be able to arrange their own food without depending on the hosteller in the hostel and will become self-sufficient.

In view of the above, the government was considering the matter of depositing the amount directly into the Aadhaar linked bank account of the students for taking personal items, in the same way the amount for food without daily supply of food through deposit was being deposited directly into the Aadhaar linked bank account of students.
GOVERNMENT DECISION:- (1) Under the Tribal Development Department, the Government has approved to provide financial assistance to the children of Scheduled Tribes in the government hostels of' A',' B' and' C' categories in the Municipal Corporations, Divisional Towns and District Levels of the State to make their daily food available at their convenient place and according to their choice. The scheme will be implemented from the academic session 2018-19.
(2) The amount payable to the students admitted in the Government Hostel for their daily meals and snacks shall be credited to the Aadhaar linked bank account of the students from the level of the Home Guard of the hostel concerned.
