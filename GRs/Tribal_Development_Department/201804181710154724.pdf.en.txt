Preamble: Golden Jubilee Tribal Pre-Secondary Scholarship Scheme for ST students studying in 1st to 10th standard in Aided/ Unaided Primary, Middle School, Zilla Parishad Schools, Municipalities and Municipal Corporations in the State. The Government decision dated 31.05.2010 has been implemented from the academic year 2010-11. In order to avoid malpractices in the scholarship scheme and to provide benefits to the eligible beneficiaries at a faster pace, the implementation of the scheme has been started from the academic year 2015-16 through e-Vikas, an online system for online application and verification of the final benefit in the bank account of the student/ parent.
Since the applications of eligible students for the Pre-Secondary Scholarship Scheme are filled at the headmaster/ school level, the details of the student list, their bank account, etc. are available at the headmaster level of the respective schools and through them the applications of the students are submitted to the Block Education Officer for approval and then the scholarship is disbursed with the approval of the Project Officer as the Area Officer of the Tribal Development Department. In this way, all the details are available at the school level and the Group Education Officer has direct control over it, so that the final approval at the level of the Zilla Parishad/ Municipal Corporation (Brihanmumbai) administration will avoid the delay in the disbursement of scholarships and the level of approval will be reduced as per the Administrative Affairs Manual.
