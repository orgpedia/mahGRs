As per the decision taken by the government, it has been decided to relax the condition of financial limit and increase the financial powers to help the tribal families stranded at various places in the state and outside the state at the project level due to the situation arising out of coronavirus. During this period, food grains are being supplied to Antyodaya cardholders, priority group cardholders and Keshari cardholders. However, a large number of families still do not have ration cards. As a result, these families are deprived of food. The Scheduled Tribes, especially the primitive tribes, Pardhi tribes and families are not getting these services due to non-availability of necessary documents/ certificates. Keeping this in mind, financial assistance is being provided to such families under the Nucleus Budget Scheme for preparation of documents, information/ lists, payment of necessary fees for ration cards, etc. However, since this did not include the inclusion of name in the ration card, reduction of name, change of name, separation of ration card, the government was considering to pay the necessary fee for this matter as well as the fee for obtaining a valid caste certificate from the central scheme.
Government's decision
As mentioned in the Preamble, keeping in view the present situation arising out of the outbreak of Corona Virus and to provide ration cards to the families of Scheduled Tribes who do not have ration cards, and to issue caste certificates, the reference No. 3 of the Government Order.
4 (a) is followed by the following paragraph No. Section 4 (d) and No. (a) is included. "
