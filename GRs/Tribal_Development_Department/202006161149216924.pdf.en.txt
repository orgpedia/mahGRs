In order to provide quality education to the students of Scheduled Tribes, the Central Government decided to establish Eklavya Residential Schools at the State level on the pattern of Navodaya Vidyalayas for tribal students with the funds to be distributed under Article 275 (1) of the Constitution of India in the Ninth Five Year Plan. As per the decision, 25 Eklavya Residential Schools have been sanctioned for tribal students from 2000-2001 to 2019-20 under this scheme in the tribal sub-plan areas of the state. New schools are being sanctioned from time to time by the central government. These schools are affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE).
The students will be provided free boarding, lodging, books, stationery, stationery, stationery, stationery, stationery and books. In view of the increasing tendency of parents to send their children to English medium schools, classes 1 to 5 in Eklavya Residential Schools have been started with state government funds. These schools are very important for the overall educational development of tribal students. Control of schools
