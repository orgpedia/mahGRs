Reference- the reference. As per the decision of the Government of Tribal Development Department dated 18th November, 2015," Bharat Ratna Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Amrit Aahar Yojana" has been launched. For the implementation of this scheme, a 4-member Aahar Committee is functioning at the Anganwadi level in the rural areas, however, it was noticed by the government that due to the lack of formation of Aahar Committee in the Nagar Panchayat/ Municipal Council areas of the tribal areas, there is a problem in implementing the" Bharat Ratna Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam Amrit Aahar Yojana" in these areas. Accordingly, it was under the consideration of the Government to set up the structure of the Aahar Committee for the implementation of the scheme in the Nagar Panchayat/ Municipal Council area.
Government Decision: It is approved to constitute an Aahar Committee for implementation of" Bharat Ratna Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam Amrit Aahar Yojana" in Municipal Councils/ Nagar Panchayats in tribal areas as follows.
