Introduction: For various minor works which are essential for ashramshala management, approval from the senior level has to be awaited. Such delayed decisions have an adverse impact on the basic facilities required for students, their health and education. The School Management Committee has already been entrusted with the responsibility of improving the overall quality of the school by providing adequate decision-making powers at the local level for the school management. Read them here to be able to carry out this responsibility properly. 2 lakh has been provided as per the government's decision. However, since the School Management Committee is still not able to spend this fund for proper works, it is proposed to issue this comprehensive government decision by amending the earlier decision of the government to establish and empower the School Management Committee.
Although the School Management Committee has a unique role in the decision-making process, the responsibility for keeping records of these decisions and for financial matters lies with the principal, superintendent/ superintendent. Due to the residential nature of the ashramshala, the superintendent/ superintendent has a huge responsibility. Therefore, their participation in the decision-making process of the school management committee is very important. Considering all these factors, the government was considering issuing a government decision clarifying the provisions related to the school management committee by overruling the government decision issued in this regard earlier. Accordingly, the government has taken the following steps:
Government Decision: 1) The School Management Committee has been given a fund of Rs 5 lakh for the management of the school in the student center. The expenditure of this fund is dependent on the local needs of the ashram.

3) The funds given to the Ashramshala Management Committee will be withdrawn from the Project Officer level and directly deposited in the bank account of the School Management Committee. This fund is a continuous
