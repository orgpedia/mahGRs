(10) Letter from the Commissioner, Tribal Development dated 22nd April, 2020 (11) Managing Director, Tribal Development Corporation, Nashik vide No. Avim/ Vip/ Khavti Grants/ 1637/20, Dy. The letter is dated May 27, 2020.
The proposal:
The State Government has always taken a sensitive role in providing financial assistance to farmers, economically weaker and scheduled tribe families. As part of this, the state government started the Khawati Loan Scheme from 1978 to prevent the families of Scheduled Tribes from starving due to financial constraints as there is no employment during the rainy season from June to September every year. The scheme was being implemented by the Maharashtra State Cooperative Tribal Development Corporation Limited, Nashik. The State Government had provided funds to the Corporation for the purpose.
Under the Khavti Loan Scheme implemented from 1978 to 2013, up to 4 units depending on the number of ST families, Rs. 2,000/-, 5 to 8 units Rs. 3,000/- for 8 units and Rs. 4,000/- was being distributed. Under the scheme, 50 per cent of the loan amount was disbursed in the form of goods and 50 per cent in the form of cash, of which 70 per cent was loan and 30 per cent was subsidy.

Government Resolution No: KHAIO-2020/ P.S. No.37/ K.A.3
As per the Government decision dated 28th June, 2013, it was decided to implement the Khoti Loan Scheme in 100% cash mode by modifying the 50% itemized and 50% cash mode in the Government decision dated 20th July, 2004. Instructions were given that the amount in cash should be paid through RTGS by opening an account in a nationalized bank in the name of the woman of the beneficiary family.
The country has been under a nationwide lockdown since March 22, 2020, to contain the spread of the coronavirus. But due to the lockdown, the work has stopped and the problem of unemployment has arisen in front of the families of the Scheduled Tribes. Due to the closure of railways, public bus transport and private transport, the scheduled tribe families are facing problems in getting food and employment. At present, the process of unlocking is going on, but considering the limited means of communication and the availability of less employment, the state government should take immediate steps to provide justice to the families of Scheduled Tribes in such an emergency situation and for this, the demand for reviving the Khawati scheme, which was closed for the year 2013-14, has been raised. The people and the government are the representatives of the people. Accordingly, the Tribal Development Corporation has submitted a proposal to the Government dated 9th April, 2020, 27th April, 2020 and Commissioner, Tribal Development, Nashik dated 21st April, 2020 for reviving the Khavti Scheme.
Accordingly, a proposal to revamp the scheme has been mooted. It has been presented to the Cabinet and approved in its meeting dated 12th August, 2020. Accordingly, the government was considering issuing a government decision to revive the Khawati scheme.
The government's decision:
As per the Government decision dated 28.06.2013, the distribution of foodgrains was 100% in cash. In order to provide relief to the families of Scheduled Tribes during the present emergency situation arising out of COVID-19, it is being approved to revive the scheme with 100% subsidy for a period of 1 year (2020-21) by exempting the decision to disburse 100% cash credit to the families of Scheduled Tribes and extend the benefit of the scheme in the form of 50% cash and 50% commodity subsidy.
2) Under the scheme, Rs. 4,000/- (Rupees Four Thousand only) per family including Rs. 2,000/- and Rs. The amount of Rs.2,000/- is being sanctioned to their bank/ postal accounts.
