Government's decision
The circular dated 16th April, 2020 issued by the Department of Finance specifies the modalities for disbursement of funds for the financial year 2020-21 keeping in view the pandemic situation in the State. Accordingly, the Department of Finance has provided funds from time to time on the Budgetary Fund Distribution System, vide Reference No. As per the decision of the Government here, 45% of the funds for 01-salary to the concerned districts included in the demand number T-9 under the District Annual Tribal Component Programme have been distributed to the concerned Controlling Officer.
Now, in the month of September, funds have been made available for disbursement by the Department of Finance on Budgetary Allocation System (BEAMS) for the purpose of 01- Salary and 36- Subsidiary Grants (Salaries) subject to a ceiling of 50% of the total budgetary provisions. In view of this, the remaining 5% funds for the purpose of 01-salary to the districts under the District Annual Tribal Sub-Plan Demand No. T-9 have been released to the concerned Controlling Officer mentioned in the return. The government is giving approval to distribute and spend in 5 ways.
The funds have been distributed on the budget distribution system. Since the economic condition of the state is likely to remain critical for some time to come due to the lockdown, the Controller should plan and spend the funds in the prescribed manner.
This fund should be used for regular payment of salaries. It should not be used to pay any pending liabilities at present.
