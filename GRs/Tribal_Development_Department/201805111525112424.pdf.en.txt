The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 and Rules, 2008 and the Rules, 2012 as amended provide for the rights of individual and collective forest rights or both under Section 3 (1). These rights are very important in terms of food security and livelihood of the tribal community. The government has issued guidelines for the implementation of these rules. Further, Section 6 (5) of the said Ordinance provides for the final determination of forest rights records in all cases by the District Level Committee. However, the government has noticed that for the last 10 years, many forest rights claims and appeals have not been finally settled by the district committee.
(2) In view of the above, in order to dispose of the pending forest rights claims and appeals within a period of six months by strictly implementing the provisions specified in the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 and Rules, 2008 and the Amended Rules, 2012, the Government has decided to implement the provisions of the said Act. The Chief Minister has issued orders. Accordingly, the Tribal Research and Training Institute, Pune has examined some of the forest rights claims and appeals and found that a large number of claims and appeals are being rejected and there are gaps in the verification process for the following reasons:

The cases should be admitted/ rejected only after verifying and ensuring that the cases are not rejected due to wrong reasons. While examining inadmissible cases, the concerned forest rights holder should be given an opportunity to appear, give evidence and make submissions by sending a notice.
The details of the duration of the Vanamitra campaign and the work to be done will be as follows.

It has been observed that in most of the districts, the claims have been accepted or rejected by the sub-divisional level committees and kept at their level. It is intended to recommend such cases and refer all three types of cases to the District Committee for final decision as per Section 6 (5) of the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, whether approved or disapproved or partially approved by the Sub-Divisional Level Committee. Action should be taken to enforce the law.
It is observed that the forest rights holders who have been allotted forest rights records in Annexure-II as per Rule 8 (h) of the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 and Rules, 2008 and the Amended Rules, 2012, are yet to get their lands enumerated and demarcated. All procedures have been completed. Keeping in view the seriousness of these matters, the disposal of pending claims and appeals in the district, fixing the four-limit limit for the recognized forest holders according to the count of their land, providing them their title deeds and handing over their land to them, etc. should be included in this campaign as above, their matter-wise details and the time required should be fixed and the implementation should be controlled accordingly. If there is a need for manpower for land enumeration, the help of district level staff and land records department should be taken. In addition, retired officers/ employees should be appointed depending on the scope of work. Since funds will be provided by the Tribal Development Department for this campaign, the concerned District Collector should request for the necessary additional funds from the Commissioner, Tribal Research and Training Institute, Pune.
7. Maa of the above" Vanamitra" campaign. This issue should be given priority as the Chief Secretary will review it. The concerned Collector should send the information of the claims and appeals disposed of in a time-bound manner under the' Vanamitra" campaign to the Commissioner, Tribal Research and Training Institute, Pune, every 15 days. The Commissioner, Tribal Research and Training Institute, Pune, as the State level nodal officer for the said campaign, shall assess the activities during the said campaign period through periodic reporting, monitoring and sample checking.
8. The objective of the campaign is to create a system where the livelihood of the forest holder is important and from the point of view of food rights, the forest holder can earn income from the forest land they get in the coming season. The campaign to dispose of pending claims and appeals should be made successful by ensuring that the campaign is completed promptly. The concerned Divisional Commissioner should review the implementation of the Vanamitra campaign fortnightly.
9. Commissioner, Tribal Research and Training Institute, Pune to take action for training and implementation as" Nodal Agency" and to review the" Vanamitra" campaign from time to time and submit a report to the Government.
