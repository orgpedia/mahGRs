Government's decision
The circular dated 16th April, 2020 issued by the Department of Finance specifies the modalities for disbursement of funds for the financial year 2020-21 keeping in view the pandemic situation in the State. Accordingly, the Department of Finance has provided funds from time to time on the Budgetary Fund Distribution System, vide Reference No. Under the Tribal Component Programme, a total of 45% of the funds for the mandatory expenditure schemes in Demand No. T-2 and T-4, 01-Salary and 36-Assistant Grants (Salary), have been disbursed to the concerned Controlling Authorities.
Now, in the month of September, funds have been made available for disbursement by the Department of Finance on Budgetary Allocation System (BEAMS) for the purpose of 01- Salary and 36- Subsidiary Grants (Salaries) subject to a ceiling of 50% of the total budgetary provisions. In view of this, the Government is approving the disbursement and expenditure of the remaining 5% funds to the concerned Controlling Authorities for the purpose of 01-Salary and 36-Assistant Grants (Salaries) for the mandatory expenditure schemes in Demand No. T-2 and T-4 mentioned in the accompanying statement.
The funds have been distributed on the budgetary fund distribution system. Since the economic condition of the state is likely to remain critical for some time to come due to the lockdown, the Controller should plan and spend the funds in the prescribed manner. This fund should be used for regular payment of salaries. It should not be used to pay any pending liabilities at present.
3. The Head of Department/ Controlling Officer may refer to Pillar No. The provisions mentioned in section 5 shall be distributed to the drawing and disbursing officers under their command. Also, while spending the funds distributed under this government decision, the head of the department and the controlling officers will have to follow the financial rules in the Maharashtra Budget Rulebook, Fiscal Rights Rulebook, as well as in the context of the Finance Department. Strictly follow the instructions given in the Government Circular dated 16.04.2020.
