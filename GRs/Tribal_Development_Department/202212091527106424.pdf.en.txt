The Proposal:
The literacy rate among the Scheduled Tribes is comparatively lower than the other categories. The students belonging to Scheduled Tribes were finding it difficult to adjust to the changed environment of higher education as they were lagging behind in higher education due to the predominant use of English language in higher education. Though the importance of English is increasing in the current environment of globalization, education through English medium was beyond the financial means of the students of Scheduled Tribes. Therefore, in order to provide a large number of opportunities to the students of Scheduled Tribes to study in English medium, Reference No. 1 here. As per the Government decision dated 28.08.2009, the scheme for providing education to the Scheduled Tribes students in English medium reputed residential schools was launched from the academic year 2010-11.
