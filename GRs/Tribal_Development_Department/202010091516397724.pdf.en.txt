The proposal-
The ashramshalas of the Tribal Development Department have not been closed in the wake of the Corona crisis as they are residential. Due to the high prevalence of Covid-19 in Maharashtra, it is challenging to continue informal schooling in the first semester in a residential ashramshala. Instead of bringing the students to school, it is planned to implement the basic concepts of education by preparing a" planning plan" to take education to the students. The entire planning process has been completed with the help of 11 sub-committees working on academic, administrative, financial and implementation components to ensure the implementation of the plan in a holistic manner. The 11 committees included officials, principals, teachers and academicians who had conducted quality educational experiments in tribal ashram schools. Detailed discussions and planning were done through daily video conferencing from June 1 to June 11. Minister: In line with the announcement made by the Tribal Development Department that" offline education will be provided to the students of the schools of the Tribal Development Department at home," it was under the consideration of the Government that the Commissionerate would implement an alternative education initiative called" Unlock Learning."
Decision of the Government: 1. In order to continue the education of the students of Government Ashramshala, Aided Ashramshala, Eklavya Nivas School and nominated schools run under the Tribal Development Department in the first semester through alternative arrangements, instead of bringing the students to the school, the project of Unlock Learning to reach the students and the educational expenses incurred for it.
