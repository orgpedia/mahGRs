The Proposal:
The Government has issued instructions regarding the applications to be made by the applicants seeking admission to professional courses in the reserved seats of Scheduled Tribes under the above Government decision to the respective Scheduled Tribe Certificate Scrutiny Committees for verification of caste certificate as per the prescribed procedure and within the prescribed time limit. These instructions were earlier issued by various colleges and other media outlets.
Thereafter, Ms. Madhuri Patil and others Vs. Additional Commissioner, Tribal Development, Thane and other cases. The Supreme Court of India in its Judgment in the Special Leave Petition No. 14767/1993 filed at New Delhi has held that the Hon. The Supreme Court has laid down various guidelines on the issue and verification of caste certificates. As per the guidelines, applicants claiming to be from the Scheduled Tribes are required to submit their caste certificate at least six months in advance to the concerned Scheduled Tribe Certificate Scrutiny Committee for examination for appointment in educational institutions and services.
The Maharashtra Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Denotified Tribes, Nomadic Tribes, Other Backward Classes and Special Backward Classes (Regulation of Issue and Verification of Caste Certificate) Act, 2000, provides for the issuance and verification of caste certificates to persons belonging to the Backward Classes. Section 6 (2) of the Act provides as follows:
(2) On receipt of the caste certificate from the competent authority, the benefit of the benefits or concessions provided for the Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled Tribes, the Vimukta Castes, the Nomadic Tribes, the Other Backward Classes or the Special Backward Classes for the purpose specified in section 3 shall be extended to the Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled Tribes, the Scheduled Tribes and the Scheduled Tribes.

Any person desirous of obtaining such caste certificate shall apply to the concerned Verification Committee in the prescribed format and in the prescribed manner in time for verification of such caste certificate and for grant of validity certificate. "
It has come to the notice of the government that despite the above instructions, applicants seeking admission to reserved seats of Scheduled Tribes for medical, engineering, agriculture, architecture, pharmacy, management, Ayurveda and other professional courses are submitting their applications for verification of caste certificate to the concerned Scheduled Tribe Certificate Scrutiny Committee without any delay. Various High Court and Supreme Court cases have also arisen from time to time.

The government has already taken the decision in this regard.
Government's decision:

Besides, the government has decided to set up 7 new ST certificate checking committee offices in Nashik-1, Palghar, Yavatmal, Gondia, Dhule, Kinwat, Nanded and Chandrapur districts. It will take some time for the committees to be formed. The applicants should submit the proposal along with the necessary documents to check their Scheduled Tribe caste certificate after getting admission in the educational institution in Class 11.
