GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: SHAHASA 2016/ PR No. 347/ KA13
Ministry of Home Affairs- 400 032
Date: January 23, 2019
Read:- Tribal Development Department, Government Circular No. ASC-1094/ PR No. 111/ K. 13,
D. 30th March 1995
The Proposal:
According to the policy of the department regarding the admission capacity of students in each class in Government Tribal Ashramshala, the student capacity in each class is 50 (40 residential and 10 Bahist).
It has restrictions to admit only tribal students as resident students. Local tribal students are admitted on a first-come-first-serve basis. As there is very little population of tribal people outside the tribal sub-plan area in Pune, Satara, Kolhapur and Ratnagiri districts, the residential tribal student capacity is not being fully filled as there are no resident tribal students available in the 8 ashrams in the area. Hence, a large number of tribal students are studying in these schools.
The rest of the students are all non-tribals. Therefore, since the Ashramshala is proposed to be transferred to the Department of Social Justice, till then the admission of students of other castes will be allowed. The Government Circular dated 30th March, 1995 had issued instructions. However, the transfer has not yet taken place. Hence, the government decided to close down the school.
Government's decision:
1) Government Ashramshala, Kurunji District, run under the Tribal Development Department.
Kolhapur, 7) Government Ashramshala, Kadvan G. Ratnagiri, 8)
