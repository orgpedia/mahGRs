The Central Government provides grants under the Special Central Assistance to the States under Article 275 (1) of the Constitution of India and under the Tribal Development Programme. Proposals for grants under this program. The report was submitted to the committee headed by the Chief Secretary. The proposals received are mainly for providing training in agriculture and animal husbandry to the Project Officers, Integrated Tribal Development Project, Panderkwada, Chandrapur, Bhamragad, Jawhar, Pen and for the people of the tribal areas.
At present, there are primitive tribes like Kolam, Katkari and Madia Gond in the state.
There are many problems like malnutrition, disease, child mortality, unemployment. The tribal communities are mainly dependent on forest and rainfed agriculture for their livelihood. At the same time, traditional means of livelihood like animal husbandry are available. Most of the people are engaged in traditional farming. They lack new technologies and proper management, so the production from agriculture and animal husbandry related to agriculture is very low. Therefore, providing proper training on the above aspects and building their capacity will help in increasing their production. In this perspective, the Department of Tribal Development had proposed a proposal worth Rs. 75.00 lakhs to the Central Government for implementation of" Training Programme for Agri& Animal Husbandry for PVTGs" for the tribal farmers in the jurisdiction of Project Officer, Integrated Tribal Development Project, Pandharkawada, Chandrapur, Bhamragad, Jawhar, Pen. This proposal has been approved by the Ministry of Tribal Affairs in the Project Appraisal Committee (PAC) meeting held on 22.05.2017 under Letter of Reference for the total amount of Rs. 75.00 lakh for the implementation of the scheme for the year 2017-18.
