The Government of Maharashtra
the Tribal Development Department
GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: SHAABS-2022/ P.S. NO. 126/ K.A.13
Madam Cama Marg, Hutatma Rajguru Chowk
Ministry, Mumbai- 400 032.
Date: December 27, 2023
The Proposal:
The scheme for construction of Government Ashramshala for ST students in Tribal Sub Plan Area is implemented under the head of Accounts 42251109 (TSP) and Government Ashramshala for ST students in Tribal Sub Plan Outlying Area is implemented under the head of Accounts 4225 1118 (OTSP). Under this scheme, new buildings are constructed for the sanctioned government ashramshalas.
Under the Tribal Component Programme, funds are made available at the district level under the sub-heading Sub Scheme code TT240041 under the District Annual Tribal Component Programme for the repair of Government Ashramshalas under the Tribal Development Department. But the provision at the district level is meagre and in the absence of adequate funds, the repair work of government ashramshala buildings cannot be completed. As a result, in the absence of repairing the ashramshala building, it is not possible to provide facilities to the tribal students.
At present, the government was considering to transfer the scheme to the state level, which was being implemented at the district level under the sub-heading of Sub Scheme code TT240041 under the District Annual Tribal Component Programme for the Government Ashramshala Building Repair Scheme.
Government's decision:
As mentioned in the Preamble, the provision at the district level under the sub-heading of Sub-Scheme code TT240041 for the repair of government ashramshalas under the Tribal Development Department under the District Annual Tribal Component Programme is meagre and the repair works of government ashramshala buildings cannot be completed due to lack of adequate funds. As a result, in the absence of repairing the ashramshala building, it is not possible to provide facilities to the tribal students. Considering this fact, the government is giving approval to transfer the scheme to the state level for effective control of the scheme at the state level.
Maintenance and repair work of government ashramshala buildings should be carried out by the construction management cell under the Tribal Development Department.
From the financial year 2024-2025, the budget should not be budgeted at the district level for the maintenance and repair of government ashram buildings.
