Chandrapur, G.S. Regarding opening of new Government Hostels for boys and girls belonging to Scheduled Tribes at Savli, G. Chandrapur.
The Government of Maharashtra
the Tribal Development Department
Government Resolution No.2019/ No.20/ K-12
Ministry, Mumbai-32.
on the 8th March 2019.
Preamble: A total of 495 Government Hostels have been sanctioned in the State for ST students under the Tribal Development Department, out of which 491 hostels are functional.
Out of these hostels, 283 are boys hostels and 208 are girls hostels. The total capacity of all 495 sanctioned hostels is 61,070 and the capacity of 491 operational hostels is 58,495. Out of these, 167 hostels are functioning in government buildings and the remaining 324 hostels are functioning in rented buildings.
Medical colleges, technical colleges, higher colleges, short term skill development based colleges, ITIs, engineering colleges, etc have been set up at various places in the state. The number of students enrolled in these colleges has also increased. Students from rural and remote areas come to the taluk, district and divisional headquarters for education. However, due to their financial condition, they cannot afford the cost of accommodation, food and education there, so they are given admission in government hostels under the Tribal Development Department to provide this facility free of cost. On an average, 75,000 applications are being received for admission to hostels from the academic year 2013-14. This was reducing the available intake capacity in proportion to the demand for hostel admissions by the Scheduled Tribe students pursuing secondary and higher secondary, as well as undergraduate and postgraduate education.
In this case, regarding the sanction of new hostels at Mauje Savli and Mauje Pombhurna, Ma. Students, teachers and members of various organisations took part in the agitation. Since Savli and Pombhurna are Naxal-affected taluks with low per capita income, zero industry, and backward in human development index, the government was considering sanctioning new hostels at Mauje Savli and Mauje Pombhurna with a view to facilitating the students of scheduled tribes to pursue higher education in the educational institutions there.
Government's decision:
1. m. Chandrapur, G.S. The Government is giving approval for opening of new Government Hostels for boys and girls belonging to Scheduled Tribes at Savli, G. Chandrapur as mentioned in the following table.
