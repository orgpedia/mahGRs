Government Resolution No: ASHA-2021/ P.S. No.10/ K-11
While implementing the Ashramshala scheme for tribal students, it was observed that in many places, even after the capacity of the Ashramshalas (40 residential and 10 non-residential students in each class) is fully utilized, many non-residential students who want to study in the vicinity are not able to get admission from the Ashramshalas. Accordingly, 200 additional batches of grant-in-aid Ashramshalas run by NGOs under Tribal Development had been sanctioned under Government decision dated 02.08.2008. The grant-in-aid Ashramshalas, where additional batches have been sanctioned, do not have adequate facilities for additional batches and many of them are presently closed due to lack of adequate number of students. As per the report submitted by the Additional Commissioner (HQ), Tribal Development Commissionerate, Nashik vide letter dated 30.11.2022, a total of 37 additional units are presently closed.
The NGO has been repeatedly demanding that the schools be given additional batches in addition to the regular batches as there are sufficient number of ST students in the premises of their aided ashram. Accordingly, the Commissioner, Tribal Development, Nashik and the Additional Commissioner, Tribal Development, Thane/ Nashik/ Nagpur/ Amravati were under the consideration of the government to increase the additional batches to the aided ashramshalas in the state as per the demand of the NGOs.
Government's decision:
Under Tribal Development, the aided Ashramshalas run by the service-oriented organization have been given reference No. The Additional Commissioner (HQ), Tribal Development Commissionerate, Nashik has submitted the details of the additional batches of Class 1 to Class 10 sanctioned under the Government decision dated 30.11.2022 to the Government. Out of 200 additional batches sanctioned to aided ashramshalas in the state, 37 batches out of 49 batches sanctioned under the purview of Commissioner, Tribal Development, Nagpur are closed.
As per the demand of the NGOs, the proposals for the increase of additional batches submitted by the Commissioner, Tribal Development, Nashik and the Additional Commissioner, Tribal Development, Thane/ Nashik/ Nagpur/ Amravati, the grant-in-aid ashramshalas run under the Tribal Development Department in the state mentioned in the following statement are being sanctioned as per the academic year 2023-2024.
