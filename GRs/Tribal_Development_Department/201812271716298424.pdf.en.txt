Preamble: Under the Tribal Development Department, a field development approach has been adopted for the overall progress of the socially/ educationally backward tribal people in the hilly and remote areas of the state. Ashramshala is an important focal point for the educational development of tribal areas under this programme. Accordingly, a total of 552 government ashramshalas have been approved under the Tribal Development Department to provide primary, secondary and higher secondary education to tribal students and to bring them into the mainstream of the society.
To disburse the salary and other dues of the teachers and non-teaching staff of the Government Ashram, travel allowance, provident fund advance, loan payments and all other kinds of payments.
The headmasters have been declared as Drawing and Disbursing Officers from time to time as per the government decisions here. However, in some primary and secondary schools, if there is a vacancy of a headmaster, then additional charge is assigned as an in-charge headmaster in such places.
However, since the in-charge Principal has not been declared as Drawing and Disbursing Officer, in such cases, the payment of salary related dues and other matters of the employees is made to the Treasury Branch.
There was a problem in sending so the government was considering declaring the in-charge principal as the Drawing and Disbursing Officer. Accordingly, the government has taken the following steps:
