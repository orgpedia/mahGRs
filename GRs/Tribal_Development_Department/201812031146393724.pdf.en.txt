(1) The Scheduled Areas (Maharashtra) Order, 1985. Notification dated 2nd December, 1985. Governor's notification 09 June, 2014 3) General Administration Department Government Decision No. BCC 2014/ Q. No.213 A/ 14/16 B.D. March 5, 2015 and d. 26th June, 2015). Aastha 2011/ No.31 (Part-I)/ Ka-15D. February 20, 2016.
Under Tribal Development Department, 502 Government Ashramshalas and 491 Hostels are functioning out of which 84 Ashramshalas from 1st to 7th standard, 297 Ashramshalas from 1st to 10th standard and 121 Ashramshalas from 1st to 12th standard have about 2 lakh students studying in these Ashramshalas.
2. The Ashramshalas functioning under the Tribal Development Department are in very remote and hilly areas and since they are residential, the teachers have to live in the school premises. As a result, teachers and non-teaching staff recruited through recruitment leave the service after being posted to other places, while some employees get transferred to other ashramshalas with communication facilities. Also, some posts remain vacant due to the non-availability of qualified candidates in the Scheduled Tribes.
The Human Development Index and Social Index of the Scheduled Areas of the State are below average due to backwardness, inaccessibility and poverty. Difficulties in delivery of services in scheduled areas such as vacancies, low attendance in offices, lack of interest in work, lack of knowledge of local language, etc.
There are reasons for this. Thinking about the yaba. The Governor said. In a notification issued on 09.06.2014, it has been decided to fill up about 17 cadre posts in various departments from local ST candidates.

4. The Government was contemplating to conduct a special recruitment drive to fill up the posts in Government Ashramshalas in remote tribal areas so that the required posts in the Ashramshalas could be filled up by experienced, educationally qualified, conversant with the culture and dialect of the tribals and willing to live in the locality.

Considering these aspects, for the posts of teacher, superintendent/ superintendent, librarian and laboratory assistant, a written examination of 35 marks based on tribal culture, local dialect knowledge, trend and intelligence test and sensitivity towards tribals should be conducted.
