The Central Government provides grants under the Special Central Assistance (SCA) Scheme, under Article 275 (1) of the Constitution of India and the Tribal Development Programme to the State Governments every year. Proposals for grants under this scheme are submitted to the Ministry of Tribal Affairs, Government of India. In the year 2014-15, the Tribal Development Department had proposed to the Central Government a scheme titled" Kitchen Garden for Ashram Schools" with the objective of providing clean, fresh, chemical-free vegetables to the students by preparing a kitchen garden on the available land at the Government Ashram School.
At present, there are 493 government ashram schools and 25 Eklavya residential ashram schools in Maharashtra. The Tribal Development Department is responsible for the overall development of the students of this government ashram school. Special programmes are being implemented by the department to ensure their health, nutrition and education in a proper manner. The students are provided with two meals and two snacks. They have to depend on suppliers for the vegetables they need for the food they are served. If the parasab is prepared on the available space at the government ashram school, the dependence on external systems for vegetable feed will be partially reduced and the students will get clean, fresh, chemical-free vegetables. At the same time, the surroundings of the school will be decorated and the environment will be pleasant and the students will also get the knowledge of agriculture under the work experience project. For this purpose, the Tribal Development Department proposed to the Central Government to implement the scheme" Kitchen Garden for Ashram Schools." The Ministry of Tribal Affairs in its Project Appraisal Committee (PAC) meeting has approved the proposal for setting up of" Kitchen Garden for Ashram Schools" at a cost of Rs. 1000.00 lakh has been sanctioned under Special Central Assistance Scheme for 2014-15 vide Letter No. The said fund has been transferred to the Commissioner, Tribal Development, Nashik, by the decision of the concerned Government.
