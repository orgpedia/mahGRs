Residential school from 8th to 12th grade. Approval has been given to start from August 2, 2021. Although the second wave has subsided, doctors and scientists have warned of a third wave. Accordingly, the lockdown was lifted in the state due to the measures taken by the state government with due care. Attendance in government offices has been increased. Other establishments have also been allowed to open in a phased manner.
Last year, the school was closed for students. Over the past year, efforts have been made to reach education to every child through various means, but due to the closure of schools, children have been sitting at home for a year and due to physical and mental stress on them, this matter should not be ignored. If schools remain closed for a long time, it will be difficult to compensate for this loss. Last year, due to the long lockdown, the teaching and learning process was disrupted. This is likely to lead to large-scale social harm such as increased child marriage, child labour, dropout rates of girls/ boys, etc. Therefore, the matter of starting schools in Covid-free areas and issuing detailed guidelines regarding the safety of students in ashramshalas was under the consideration of the government to ensure that students get the benefit of regular education.
Considering the background mentioned in the Government Resolution Preamble, permission is being granted to start Government and Aided Ashramshalas and Eklavya Model Residential Schools from 4 th October 2021 in the COVID free areas of the State. The state government has decided to reopen schools for classes 5 to 7.
(1) Gram Panchayats in rural areas under their jurisdiction in Covid-free villages

That should be decided.
(2) The characteristics of the Ashramshalas of the Tribal Development Department at the Gram Panchayat level are different.

Therefore, the decision to start the school should be taken together with the concerned project office and local administration. However, the final decision will be taken by the officials.
