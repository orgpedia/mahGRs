Reference Decision No. Under the Adim Janjatiya Ghar Kul scheme, a target of 1500 has been fixed for the year 2014-15 for a total of 06 districts. Accordingly, a target of 250 houses has been set for Nanded district. However, in Nanded district, there are not enough eligible beneficiaries available to provide houses under the scheme. Therefore, it is requested to revise the target and divert the remaining funds to other districts.
