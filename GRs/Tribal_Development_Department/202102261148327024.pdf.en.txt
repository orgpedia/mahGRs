The government has decided to reopen schools and colleges in a phased manner in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. About 55,000 ST boys and girls are admitted every year in 486 government hostels functioning under the department. Hostel admissions have also started in the current academic year and gradually the number of admissions is going to increase.
In such a situation, the government was considering a proposal to open the hostel rooms in the state by following all the rules and guidelines issued by the government from time to time in the context of the Covid-19 circular.
Government circular:
Under the Tribal Development Department, students are being allowed to take admission in the government hostels of the state and under the Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya Swayam Yojana subject to the following conditions.
Reference No. 1. As per the circular issued by the state government, the opening of schools/ hostels from class 8 to class 12 under the Tribal Development Department in the state as well as the reference number of the Higher Technical Education Department. It has been decided to open all the colleges as per the government circular here. Accordingly, students admitted to all these courses are being allowed to apply online for hostel admission.
The 2020-21 school year is over. Priority should be given to the students of classes 8 to 12 and professional courses by following the guidelines mentioned in the circular issued by the government. If the intake capacity exceeds the capacity by following the rules, they should be given the benefit through DBT as per Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya Swayam Yojana. For this, the project officer is giving approval to allow the student to stay in the hostel only after following the instructions issued from time to time by the health department and the local administration.
