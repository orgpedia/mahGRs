Read:- Government of Revenue and Forest Department Decision No. Savavi-2018/ No. 144/ F-11, Dy. 06/09/2018 Preamble: The Forest Department has no option but to take up a massive afforestation programme in non-forest areas due to limitations in tree plantation. Because the forest is limited and there is no scope for growth. Keeping these aspects in mind, it is decided to take up a comprehensive programme of tree plantation in non-forest areas. This includes planting trees at all administrative departments of the state government, railways, national highways, defence establishments and other central institutions. Tree plantation programmes will be implemented through all these systems with specific targets. For this, the government will need funds. Under the said programme, the Administrative Departments having their own open space under the said programme have been approved to make provision under the new head for" Tree Plantation and Conservation" within the limit of 0.5 per cent of their overall budgetary allocation from" Programme Expenditure" (under the earlier schemes). Accordingly, it was under consideration of the Government to open a new head office in all the field offices of the Tribal Development Department (including all the tribal ashramshalas and hostels) to provide funds under the scheme of" Tree Plantation and Maintenance (State Level)."
GOVERNMENT DECISION: The Government is approving opening of new head accounts in all the field offices of the Tribal Development Department (including all the tribal ashramshalas and hostels) for providing funds under the scheme of" Tree Plantation and Maintenance (State Level)" as under:
