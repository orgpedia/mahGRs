Government Resolution No. 2003/ P.S. 107/ K.A.13 dated 30th January, 2004.
Preamble: As the matter of establishment of new Vocational Training Institutes is costly, the Government have approved the establishment of Vocational Training Centres in 4 Government Ashramshalas, 2 in Gadchiroli district and 1 each in Thane and Raigad districts, as per the instructions of the Central Government for the Vocational Training Centres in Government Post Basic Ashramshalas functioning in the State for imparting Vocational Training through Central Assistance. Thereafter. As per the Government decision dated 30th January, 2004, it has been approved to start Vocational Training Centre (VTC) in 11 Government Post Basic Ashramshalas.
At present, 114 contractual employees are working in the Vocational Training Centres of 15 Post Basic Ashramshalas. Since 2013-14, the scheme has not received any funds from the central government and is being funded by the state government. Since the launch of the scheme, some of the training centres seem to be closed due to lack of upgradation of training courses, low student response or other reasons. Therefore, the government was considering the formation of a study committee to evaluate the courses being implemented by the said centers and decide how to implement the revised courses, and how and where to accommodate the employees working if the said center is to be closed.
Government Decision: The following Study Committee is being constituted for evaluation of Vocational Training Centres in Post Basic Ashramshalas.
