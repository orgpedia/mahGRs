GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: CENTRAL-2019/ PR No.29/ KA-19
Mantralaya, Mumbai 400032
Date: 1/1/2021
Ministry of Tribal Affairs, New Delhi vide letter No.F.No. 11015/03 (13)/ 2014-SG dated 19.06.2014 No.78/ K19D March 17, 2015. 28 March 2015 Introduction- Various schemes are implemented for tribal communities through the Tribal Development Department.
The tribal people live mainly in the hilly, valley and remote areas and their livelihood is dependent on rain-fed agriculture and textile business and forest produce. Since they are primarily rain-fed, there is no guarantee of assured income through farming every year. As a result, they have to migrate in search of jobs. They can get assured income if they associate farming with farming. Goat rearing is mainly done as an adjunct to agriculture in tribal areas. It does not require much money and space to grow. This business is profitable. This industry is mainly for women. Therefore, giving one unit of 10 goats and 1 goat to women SHGs will help in strengthening the SHGs by increasing their income and will also reduce their migration.
For the year 2014-15, under the Special Central Assistance Scheme," Supply of Goat Units to Women SHGs (10 Female+ 1Male)" was proposed to the Government of India. The Government of India has sanctioned Rs. 500.00 lakh for the year 2014-15 for implementation of the scheme" Supply of Goat Units to Women SHGs (10 Female+ 1 Male)" from the grant sanctioned under the Special Central Assistance Scheme. Therefore, under the program to increase the income of women self-help groups through goat farming and strengthen the self-help groups, the government was considering approving the guidelines of the scheme" Supply of Goat Units to Women SHGs (10 Female+ 1 Male)."
Guidelines for implementation of the scheme" Supply of Goat Units to Women SHGs (10 Female+ 1 Male)" worth Rs. 500.00 lakh sanctioned under the programme" Strengthening of SHGs by increasing the income of women SHGs through goat rearing and reducing their migration" are being approved as per Annexure No. 1 annexed through this decision.
