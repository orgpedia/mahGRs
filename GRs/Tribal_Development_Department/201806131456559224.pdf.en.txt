The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 and Rules, 2008 and Rules, 2012.
Preamble: The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 and Rules, 2008 and the Rules, 2012 as amended, provide for the rights of individual and collective forest rights or both under Section 3 (1).
These include the right of Scheduled Tribes or other traditional forest dwellers to own and inhabit forest land for cultivating it for their livelihood; rights such as the right to dispossession; right of ownership to collect, use or dispose of minor forest produce traditionally collected within or outside the limits of the village; right to obtain fish and other products from the water, grazing, traditional seasonal resources; right to protect, restore, conserve, manage any social forest resource that has been traditionally protected and conserved for sustainable use.
The land to be diverted for the Nagpur-Mumbai Shigrachar Expressway (Maharashtra Samruddhi Highway) includes private land as well as forest patches acquired under the said Act, apart from reserved and protected forest land. The said Act does not contain any provision as to the rate at which compensation should be paid to a forest right holder if an area of forest land sanctioned under the provisions of the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 is affected by a public project. Therefore, the government was considering the formation of a committee to compensate the forest rights holders affected by the Nagpur-Mumbai Shigra Sanchar Expressway (Maharashtra Samruddhi Highway) project.
Government Decision: As mentioned in the Preamble, the following Committees are being constituted under the Chairmanship of Principal Secretary, Tribal Development Department to provide compensation to the forest rights holders affected by the Nagpur-Mumbai Shigra Sanchar Expressway (Maharashtra Samruddhi Highway) project.
