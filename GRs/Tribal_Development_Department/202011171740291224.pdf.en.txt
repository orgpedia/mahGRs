Government's decision
The circular dated 16th April, 2020 issued by the Department of Finance specifies the modalities for disbursement of funds for the financial year 2020-21 keeping in view the pandemic situation in the State. Accordingly, the Department of Finance has provided funds from time to time on the Budgetary Fund Distribution System, vide Reference No. Under the Tribal Component Programme, 70% of the funds have already been released to the concerned Controlling Authorities under the demand number T-5 of the programme expenditure under the Government decisions here under the head 01- Salary and 36- Subsidiary Grants (Salaries).
Now, in the month of December, the Department of Finance has decided to allocate 75% of the total budgetary allocation for the objectives of 01-Salary and 36 Subsidiary Grants (Salaries) on the Budgetary Distribution System (BEAMS), as per Chapter No. 11- Funds have been made available for disbursement in respect of domestic travel expenses with a ceiling of 20%. Accordingly, the Government is approving the disbursement and expenditure of funds to the concerned Controlling Authorities within the limit of 20% for 01- Salary and 36- Subsidiary Grants (Salaries) and the remaining 5% for 11- Travel Expenses, after deducting the funds released earlier.
The funds have been distributed on the budgetary fund distribution system. Considering the pandemic situation in the state due to Corona virus, the financial condition of the state is likely to be serious for some time to come, so the controlling officer should plan and spend the funds in the prescribed manner. This fund should be used for regular payment of salaries. It should not be used to pay any pending liabilities at present.
3. The Head of Department/ Controlling Officer may refer to Pillar No. The provisions mentioned in section 5 should be circulated immediately to the Drawing and Disbursing Officers under them. Also, while spending the funds distributed under this government decision, the head of the department and the controlling officers will have to follow the financial rules in the Maharashtra Budget Rulebook, Fiscal Rights Rulebook, as well as in the context of the Finance Department. Strictly follow the instructions given in the Government Circular dated 16.04.2020.
