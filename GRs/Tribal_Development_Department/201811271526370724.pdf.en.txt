Madam Cama Road, Hutatma Rajguru Chowk,
Ministry of Health, Mumbai- 32
The 27th November 2018.
Read:- 1. Tribal Development Department, Government Resolution No. 2016/ No. 87/ K-12, D. 15.10.2016.
Tribal Development Department, Government Corrigendum No. 2016/ No. 87/ K-12, D. 05.10.2018.
The Proposal:
Pt. Deendayal Upadhyaya Swayam Yojana has been launched to distribute funds directly into the Aadhaar linked bank accounts of Scheduled Tribe students for food, accommodation and educational materials for higher education, within the limit of total 20,000 students who have not been admitted to the government hostels functioning in the department since the academic year 2016-17. Under this scheme, financial assistance is provided to the students of Scheduled Tribes admitted in educational institutions at the municipal corporation, divisional cities and district level for providing housing allowance, food allowance, subsistence allowance and educational materials. Similarly, the Certain amendments have been made in the Corrigendum dated 05.10.2018.
However, since the inception of the scheme, the actual number of beneficiaries has been very low as compared to the number of applications received under the scheme. As the stages of approval of applications under the scheme are more, it takes more time to approve the applications. Accordingly, the matter of amending the terms and conditions of the scheme and the fact that out of the total 491 hostels functioning under the department, 272 hostels are operational at the taluk level and at present, many talukas have the same educational facilities as the district level, the number of ST students studying in educational institutions at the taluk level has increased. Considering this fact, in order to benefit more and more students under the scheme and to ensure that tribal students are not deprived of residential and educational facilities, the inclusion of the taluk level under the Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya Swayam Yojana was also under the consideration of the government. The present reference No. The Government is taking the following decisions by superseding the Government Decisions 1 and 2.
Government's decision:
At present, in addition to the SWAYAM scheme being implemented at the municipal corporation, divisional cities and district level, from the academic year 2018-19, the taluk level education after 12th standard will be started.
