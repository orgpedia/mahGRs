Introduction: The vision of Area Development has been adopted for the overall progress of the socially/ educationally backward tribal population in the hilly and remote areas of Maharashtra State. Under this program, the government started the" Ashramshala Group" scheme from the year 1972-73 to spread education in the tribal areas. Under this scheme, 502 Government Ashramshalas and 556 Aided Ashramshalas are being run under the Tribal Development Department to take tribal students to secondary and higher secondary education and to bring them into the mainstream of the society. The school provides free education to students from class 1 to 12.
Although 502 government and 556 aided ashramshalas are running in the state, at present 121 government and 154 aided ashramshalas are running science and arts classes of higher secondary (class 11 and 12). Of them, Ma. As per the approval of the Cabinet in its meeting held on November 01, 2018, 10 Government and 11 Aided Ashramshalas have been sanctioned under Government Decision dated November 27, 2018 and June 06, 2019 respectively and 8 posts of Higher Secondary (4 for Arts and 4 for Science) have been sanctioned to these Ashramshalas.
However, for the government and aided ashramshalas functioning before that, as per the figure fixed by the Tribal Development Department, 4 posts of teachers for Arts and 3 for Science are sanctioned in the higher secondary ashramshalas. The science stream is taught in classes 11 and 12, with mathematics, physics, biology and chemistry as the main subjects. A separate teacher is required for each subject. However, since there is less than one teacher for the science stream in the ashramshalas under the Tribal Development Department, the subjects of Physics and Chemistry or Physics and Mathematics have to be taught by the same teacher. At present, out of three teachers appointed for the science stream, one teacher has a post-graduate degree.
