Government's decision:
Finance Department No. In a circular dated 16th April, 2020, it has been approved to disburse funds in the range of 15-25% of the total annual budgetary allocation for the first 3 months of the financial year 2020-21 for the schemes of essential and programme expenditure, taking into account the pandemic situation in the State.
Commissioner, Tribal Development No. Under the letter, the government had received a proposal to provide funds for the payment of pending fees for the academic year 2019-20 for the designated residential schools under the department. In pursuance of the said proposal, during the financial year 2020-21, under the Tribal Component Programme, under Demand No. T-5 (02) (29)- Teaching of ST Students in English Medium Designated Residential Schools (2225 C 999), Chapter No. The Government has approved the release of Rs. 81.41 crore (Rupees Eighty One Crore Forty One Lakh only) to the Controller General and Commissioner, Tribal Development, Nashik out of the budgeted Rs. 360.00 crore under Subsidiary Grants (Non-Salary).
The funds have been distributed on the budgetary fund distribution system. Since the economic condition of the state is likely to remain critical for some time to come due to the lockdown, the Controller should plan and spend the funds in the prescribed manner. The funds will be utilised for payment of pending fee payments for the academic year 2019-20 generated on the online system of the designated residential schools under the department.
(3) The Controller of Expenditure shall apply the financial rules contained in the Maharashtra Budget Rulebook and the Financial Powers Rulebook to the State Government in respect of the expenditure of funds disbursed under the said Government Decision.
