At present, there are three primitive tribal groups in the state- Kolam, Katkari and Madia Gond. These castes are far away from the original streams of development and in comparison to other castes they are economically and socially backward.
They are behind. There is a danger of cultural disintegration in front of this tribe and among these tribes.
There is a feeling of being left out of the mainstream of development, in such a situation, there is a need for a long-term policy framework of inclusive and participatory nature for these groups of people.
