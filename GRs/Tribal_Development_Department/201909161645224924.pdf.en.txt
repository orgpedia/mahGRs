Preamble: Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya SWAYAM Yojana has been launched to provide food, accommodation and other educational materials to the ST students in the total number of 20,000 who have taken admission in the post-Class XII courses from the academic year 2016-17 but have not been admitted in the government hostels.
Reference No. Under the scheme of" Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya Swayam Yojana," the students of Scheduled Tribes who have been admitted through the centralized admission process in the recognized technical education and business education course colleges after 12th class at the taluk level but have not been admitted to the government hostel are being given benefits.
In order to help more and more Scheduled Tribe students who are deprived of hostel admission to get the benefit under the SWAYAM scheme and to meet the maximum targets under the scheme, it was under the consideration of the Government to amend the SWAYAM scheme to provide benefits to the Scheduled Tribe students who have taken admission in colleges established within a radius of 5 km from the Municipal Corporation, Divisional, District and Taluk level for courses of two years or more after class 10.
