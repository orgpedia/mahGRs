Accordingly, a meeting was held on 01.09.2022 under the chairmanship of Hon'ble Minister (AV) to discuss the modalities to increase the ratio of tribal candidates appearing for Government/ Paramilitary Services Examinations and Government jobs and to provide them pre-examination training for competitive examinations.

It was decided to constitute a committee to suggest measures for effective implementation of the scheme of competitive examinations to be implemented by the Institute of Competitive Education, Pune.
