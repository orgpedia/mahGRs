Preamble: Under the Tribal Appropriation Act, 5054 517, the works of roads and bridges are taken up under the Public Works Department.
The Superintending Engineer, Public Works Board concerned was informed to submit the details of the road and bridge works completed financially and physically from the funds disbursed in the financial year 2020-21 to the Government. Accordingly, the concerned Superintending Engineer, Public Works Board, while submitting the proposal for the financial and physical completion of the road and bridge works from the funds disbursed in the financial year 2020-21 and the demand for funds for the financial year 2021-22, has proposed to exclude some of the works approved in the year 2020-21 due to the reasons such as being approved in another scheme, lack of space, existing bridges on the road and no place to build another bridge on the road, not being able to construct roads and bridges within the administrative approval amount, etc. Also, the works sanctioned in 2018-19 and earlier were under consideration of the government for cancellation of road works due to space constraints, delay in execution of works and non-completion of works.
