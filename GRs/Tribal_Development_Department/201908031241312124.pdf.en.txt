Preamble: As per the Government decision dated 28.12.2017 in the aforesaid Reference No. 2, the students studying under the scheme are to be provided education in English medium designated residential schools from the Project Office at the beginning of the first semester and second semester of the academic year to the concerned designated school and after the end of the first semester and second semester, from the concerned designated school to the concerned designated school through the Project Office through the buses of Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation or through the school buses of the school administration with the approval of the competent officer of the Regional Transport Department. Accordingly, the nominated school has been directed to submit the payment of the said travel expenses to the Commissioner, Tribal Development, Maharashtra State, Nashik through the Project Officer and the Commissioner, Tribal Development, Maharashtra State, Nashik will be responsible for payment of the said travel expenses.
However, since the bus journey of the students of the nominated schools is from the project office to the school and from the school to the project office, the project office has the detailed information about the journey. As there is a direction to submit the payment of this bus journey to the Commissioner, Tribal Development, Maharashtra State, Nashik, these payments have to travel from the Project Office to the Additional Commissioner's Office and then to the Commissioner's Office and back from the Commissioner's Office to the Additional Commissioner's Office and Project Office. Also, if there are any errors in the verification of these payments, the rounds of these payments increase from the Commissionerate to the Additional Commissionerate to the Project Office. To avoid this travel of the bus travel dues of the students, the government was considering to give the project officer the authority to approve the payment of the bus travel expenses of the nominated school so that the payments could be passed at a faster pace without being pending for a long time.
