Proposal- Decision of the Government of the Department of Finance. As on 27.01.2017, with the amalgamation of non-plan and plan expenditure from 2017-18 onwards, the earlier break-up of budgetary expenditure into committed expenditure and scheme expenditure has been discontinued. Accordingly, the expenditure on other non-plan schemes, except for the earlier establishment expenditure, has been included in the scheme expenditure, which mainly includes Government Ashramshalas, Aided Ashramshalas, Government Hostels, Scholarships/ subsistence allowance etc. The allocation of budget in the ratio of 60: 40 for district-level: State-level schemes before 2018-19 under Tribal Appropriation is in order, as there is a limitation in providing the same level of allocation in proportion to the demand for the above priority schemes of the department.

Additional funds are being provided at the district level. However, it has been observed that such duplicity is leading to difficulties in planning the annual funds as per requirement as well as disbursement of funds to the concerned office as per demand. Further, the Department has adopted the policy of crediting the prescribed amount in the bank accounts of the students through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) mode fully from the financial year 2018-19 under the above schemes.
As per this, the prescribed amount has to be transferred directly to the bank account of the students from one central place and the provision of schemes for this has to be done at one place at the state level.
Further, since such committed schemes are allocated largely from the District Annual Appropriation Budget, the District Annual Appropriation Fund is limited to provide adequate funds for implementation of other developmental schemes as per local needs. Considering all these factors, the government was considering to transfer the mandatory expenditure schemes under the sub-development head" Backward Classes Welfare" under the District Annual Tribal Appropriation Scheme to the state level and accordingly change the formula for allocation of budgetary allocations at the state and district level. Accordingly, the government has taken the following decisions:
Government Decisions Under the Tribal Component Programme, from the financial year 2019-20, the schemes at the district level are being transferred to the state level. Accordingly, the following action should be taken: (1) Provisions for these schemes shall henceforth be provided at the State level, for which no provision shall be proposed at the district level.
(2) The expenditure of the said schemes shall be covered under the heading" State Level Accounts" mentioned in column 5 of the Annexure.
3) The Commissioner, Tribal Development, Nashik shall collectively demand and disburse funds under the head" State Level Accounts" for the annual expenditure on the schemes mentioned in the Annexure.
2. Since the establishment under the Tribal Component Programme and the transfer of the District Plan in the Appendix to the State Level with the obligatory form of scholarships, the cost of these plans will be shared at the State level from the financial year 2019-20.

The annual budget available for the programme is being approved to be planned as follows.
1) Out of the total annual budget received from the Planning/ Finance Department under the Tribal Component Programme, the budgetary allocation for the State level and district level applications should be allocated from the remaining budgetary allocation for other developmental schemes by deducting the necessary expenditure for the establishment (salary and office matters) and committed (equipment, food, educational liabilities) expenditure schemes of the Tribal Development Department. The other development budgets should be allocated as follows.
5%-Pesa direct subsidy to Gram Panchayats,
55%- State Level Tribal Component Programme
40%- district tribal component program.
2) The percentage of area-wise budgetary allocation fixed under the District Annual Tribal Component Programme, as per the Government decision dated 13.10.2017, is being abolished and the sub-development area of" Backward Classes Welfare (Special Area)" should be included in the" Gabha Area" from the year 2019-20. Also, the area should be included in the" non-core area" instead of showing the" innovative plan" as a separate sub-development area.
Accordingly, the classification of the sub-development areas under core area and non-core area is being decided as follows and for this purpose, the District Tribal Unit Programme should be allocated at least 3/4 th and maximum 1/4 th of the sanctioned annual outlay respectively.
