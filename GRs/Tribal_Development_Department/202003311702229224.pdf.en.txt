Bharat Ratna Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Amrit Aahar Yojana has been launched as per the Government decision dated 18.11.2015 to provide one time square meal to pregnant women in Scheduled Areas and Additional Tribal Sub Plan areas. Further, Phase-II scheme for feeding eggs/ bananas/ seasonal fruits etc. to all children in the age group of 7 months to 6 years has been launched as per Government decision dated 5th August, 2016.
The Ministry of Women and Child Development, Government of India has issued guidelines vide letter dated 30.03.2020 in view of the large scale spread of Corona Virus in the State. Further, guidelines for Anganwadis have been issued vide letter dated 20th March, 2020 by the Commissionerate of Integrated Child Development.
According to this, if the beneficiaries are given hot fresh food sitting together in the anganwadi, then there can be contact with each other and the infection can spread. Therefore, instructions have been given to distribute food at home in the form of THR.
In the present situation of lockdown in the state, there has been a demand from the field level to provide regular food and eggs/ bananas under the Amrit Aahar scheme to the pregnant and lactating mothers and children of 7 months to 6 years of age in the scheduled areas.
Accordingly, the following recommendations have been made for the implementation of the scheme:
