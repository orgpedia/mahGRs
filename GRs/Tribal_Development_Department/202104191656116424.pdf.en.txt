have arrived. However, the Central Govt. It has come to the notice of the Government that the newly declared villages in the Scheduled Areas under the notification dated 02.12.1985 are deprived of various benefits available to the villages in the Scheduled Areas only on getting a new name despite being in the original declared geographical Scheduled Areas. Therefore, the matter of applying the benefits of the Scheduled Area to the newly created villages after the division of the census from the villages in the Scheduled Area since 1971 was under the consideration of the Government until the new Scheduled Area was declared by the Central Government.
GOVERNMENT DECISION: As per the provisions of Rule 4 of the Maharashtra Gram Panchayat (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Rules, 2014, the Divisional Commissioner has been empowered to declare new separate revenue villages from the revenue villages in the scheduled areas. Further, as per the proviso to clause 1 of section 4 of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Act, 1966 (Maharashtra Act No. 41 of 1966), the Revenue Officer of the competent rank is empowered to notify any area outside the village limits of a village having each wadi and separate dwelling. As per the said procedure, new villages are declared from the villages in the scheduled areas.
New villages are declared by following the above mentioned procedure. However, as mentioned in the proposal, the present Central Govt. It has been observed that the newly declared villages in the Scheduled Areas under the notification dated 02.12.1985 are deprived of various benefits accruing to the villages in the Scheduled Areas merely by virtue of getting a new name despite being in the original declared geographical Scheduled Areas. Therefore, it is being approved to extend the benefits of Scheduled Areas to the newly created villages after the final division of the census from the villages in the Scheduled Areas since 1971 till the new Scheduled Areas are declared by the Central Government.
To improve the implementation of important programmes and schemes implemented by the Government for the welfare and progress of the tribals living in the scheduled areas. The Governor has, by notification from time to time, reserved direct service posts for candidates belonging to the Scheduled Tribes in the Scheduled Areas. For the posts to be filled by direct recruitment reserved for the candidates of the said Scheduled Tribes, the benefit should be given to the candidates of the newly created villages after bifurcation from the villages of the Scheduled Areas till the new Scheduled Areas are declared by the Central Government.
