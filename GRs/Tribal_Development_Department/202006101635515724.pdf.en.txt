As per the decision of the Government under the Preamble, it has been decided to relax the condition of financial limit and increase the financial powers to provide assistance at the project level to the tribal families stranded at various places in the State and outside the State due to Corona virus. During this period, food grains are being supplied to Antyodaya cardholders, priority group cardholders and Keshari cardholders. However, a large number of families still do not have ration cards. As a result, these families are deprived of food. It is observed that the Scheduled Tribes, especially the Adivasi and Pardhi tribal families, are not getting these services due to non-availability of necessary documents/ certificates. Keeping this in mind, the government was considering providing financial assistance to such families under the Nucleus Budget Scheme for preparing documents, information/ lists, payment of necessary fees for ration cards, etc.

" 4 (a) The necessary fee to be paid for the distribution of ration cards to the families of Scheduled Tribes who are in financial distress in the current coronavirus situation should be paid by the concerned project officer to the concerned agency through the Nucleus Budget Scheme.
