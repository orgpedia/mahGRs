The Proposal:
Under the Tribal Development Department, the works of roads and bridges are taken up by the District Council under the head of accounts 3054 2722.
Out of the pending works sanctioned under head 3054 2722, the work orders which have not yet been issued have been received from the respective District Councils. Also, while seeking funds for the financial year 2021-22, information has been received that some works in Palghar district are not in progress, works in Nashik district are on tender, forest department's permission is not received and work is not in progress, and works in Gondia district are approved in other schemes, work is not in progress. Accordingly, the matter of cancellation of road works was under consideration of the government due to the reasons such as being at the tender level of the works approved under headings 3054 2722, not obtaining permission from the Forest Department, being approved in other schemes and not yet started works.
GOVERNMENT DECISIONS: Out of the works sanctioned under headings 3054 2722, 30 road and bridge works worth Rs. 580.00 lakh in the accompanying statement A are being cancelled due to tender status, non-availability of Forest Department permission, sanctioned in other scheme or not yet started.
