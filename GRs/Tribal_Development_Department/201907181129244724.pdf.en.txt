Introduction: Under the Tribal Development Department, residential ashramshalas have been started for the children of socially/ educationally backward tribal communities in remote and hilly areas of the state. The Ashram is run by the government and NGOs on a grant basis. At present, there are 496 government and 556 aided ashramshalas in the state, where a total of 4,55,000 students are studying.
Under the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, a teacher is supposed to teach 30 students. These 30 students are not supposed to be in the same class. While making such a provision in the law, it is expected that the teacher will remain a multigrade teacher.
Teachers as well as society need to understand that every student is unique. His thoughts, emotions and learning speed are different. So, even if 30 students appear to belong to the same class, their learning levels are at 30 different levels. So all these students cannot be taught like" understanding at the same level" just because they are in the same class. This is evident in today's education system. Thus, the blame for the failure of multicultural/ multilevel education is being laid on certain provisions of the Right to Education Act. Considering these aspects, the Department of School Education and Sports has fixed the revised criteria for accreditation vide Government Resolution dated 28.08.2015.
3. Considering the need of all the above, the matter of determining the criteria based on the number of students was under consideration of the Government. School Education and Sports Department
