Government Resolution: No. Shaasha 2019/ P.S. 400/ Ka-13
Mantralaya, Mumbai- 400
Date: 28th of November 2019
There are 502 government ashramshalas in Maharashtra. The roads connecting the ashramshalas are in a bad condition as the ashramshalas are in remote and hilly areas and in heavy rains.
Government ashramshalas have a large area where rain causes mudslides, grass growth, etc., and some work needs to be done to make the internal roads suitable for safety. It is very important to have communication facilities for ashramshalas. It is necessary to provide roads connecting ashramshalas from the main road. Such works are to be taken up under the head 3054 in the first instance.
The programme is being run under the Ashramshala Jodra.
