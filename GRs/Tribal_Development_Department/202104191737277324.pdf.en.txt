the proposal
Schemes which are locally necessary for tribal development or welfare. And the Nucleus Budget Scheme is being implemented to ensure that the innovative schemes of local importance, which are not included in the budget or centrally funded schemes, are implemented immediately and effectively at the local level without getting stuck for a long time due to technical formalities and to provide their benefits directly to the needy tribals.
Due to the situation arising out of the Corona virus in the state, various benefits have been provided to the tribal families under the Nucleus Budget Scheme for the year 2020. At present, the corona virus is spreading rapidly in the country. Even the most remote mountainous areas of the state have not been spared. As a result, the disease has spread to the rural areas of the state. Therefore, considering the background and the means of economic income of the tribals and their limitations, the government was considering to approve the expenditure for Remdesivir injection for a patient belonging to the Scheduled Tribes of the state admitted due to corona disease in a private hospital.
