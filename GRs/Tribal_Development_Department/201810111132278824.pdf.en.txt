The date: September 26, 2018
Read: 1) Government Decision, Tribal Development Department, No. Shaasha-2008/ Q.No. 102/ Ka-13, dated August 2, 2008.
Preamble: Under the Tribal Development Department, 200 additional batches of grant-in-aid Ashramshalas run by NGOs have been sanctioned as per the Government decision dated 2nd August, 2008. These 200 batches have been allocated from time to time as per the demand of the institutions. However, no additional posts of cook have been created for the students in these additional batches. Approval has been given to sanction 10% of the cost of preservation grant to women SHGs for preparation of additional batches of children's meals.
Most of the ashramshalas in the state are in tribal and remote areas and additional batches have been allocated to these schools. Most of the ashramshalas are located far away from the village, so despite repeated requests, women self-help groups are not keen to take up cooking. Similarly, the women of these self-help groups are not able to work throughout the day as per the revised schedule of the ashramshalas. In such a situation, it becomes difficult for the students to get food on time. The Maharashtra Adivasi Ashramshala Chalak Sanstha, an organisation run by Adivasi tribals, has urged the government to allow local persons to work as cooks on honorarium basis to cook food for the additional batch of students in the aided ashramshala. The proposal was under the consideration of the government.
Government Decision: There is a provision for making food for the students of the additional batches of aided ashramshalas by women self-help groups. However, in places where women self-help groups are not available despite efforts, this work is done by local people.
