Madam Cama Marg, Hutatma Rajguru Chowk,
Mantralaya, Mumbai 400 032
The date is November 11, 2021.
Tribal Development Department, Government Resolution No: NUBIO-2011/ PR No.87/ K.7 dated 21st June, 2013
Preamble: The Central Budget Scheme (Nucleus Budget) is being implemented to ensure that innovative schemes of local importance, which are locally required for tribal development or welfare and are not included in the budget or centrally funded schemes, are implemented immediately and effectively at the local level without getting stuck for a long time due to technical formalities.
Moha trees are found in large numbers in the forested and remote tribal-dominated areas of Maharashtra. In this place, the tribal people earn their livelihood by selling charms in a traditional way. The flowers are damaged by soil and other factors as they fall from the trees, making it difficult to collect. For this, the government was considering to include the matter of providing' mesh for Mohafool collection' in the central budget plan.
Government Decision: Under the Union Budget Scheme (Nucleus Budget), the income generation or income enhancement schemes in Group' A' are being included in the schemes related to agriculture or similar occupations to increase the income of the beneficiary.
The Regional Offices should take this into consideration while preparing the annual plans of the Central Budget Scheme.
