Letter from the Commissioner, Tribal Development Commissionerate, Nashik. 6 (3), s. 17.07.2020.
Introduction: Under the Tribal Development Department, the students of the Government Ashram School were being given personal items like uniforms, night dresses, PT dresses, sweaters, towels, oil, toothpaste and brushes, undergarments, bedding, school and writing materials etc. in the form of items. Students were also provided with books, stationery, stationery and other items. However, due to complaints, court cases, etc., there were difficulties in completing the purchase process on time, otherwise the students could not get the necessary materials in time. There were also questions about quality and quantity. Questions were raised in the Assembly about the distribution of sweaters and other items after the end of winter. Considering all these aspects, since all the items are for personal daily use and can be purchased by the parents, the department has taken a policy decision to provide direct funding for these items from the academic year 2017-18.
The students staying in government hostels were provided food by arranging food stalls. However, the hostel students had some issues as their school/ college timings were different. Also, students often complain about changing the food contractor. There were also accounting objections as the rates for food served in the same city hostel were different. Since the children living in the hostel are older, they are able to arrange for food themselves. Also, the hotels are in private areas.

Food is available. Considering all these factors, the department has decided to provide funds directly to the students for food in the hostels in the district, division and municipal corporation areas. 05.04.2018. The decision was initially opposed by some organisations. But in the last couple of years, the process has been smooth.
While implementing the DBT policy in government ashramshalas, the students concerned should buy the goods first. After that, the amount will be reimbursed by the government. But considering the financial condition of the tribal students, the department decided to give advance funds to the students of the ashramshala. Also, it has been decided to provide all the personal items to the students in the hostel completely in advance. Students will also be given three months' worth of food in advance. So that the students can pay the amount to the caterer on time or the students can group and buy the ingredients and run the eatery on a cooperative basis.
However, there have been protests in the state over the discontinuation of the DBT scheme and the members of the assembly have pointed out that the cash in hand has caused health problems as it is not being used for nutritious food by children. Considering this, the government was considering the formation of a study group to study the ongoing DBT policy for students in government ashramshalas and hostels.
Government's decision:
A study group is being formed to study the DBT policy for the students of government ashramshalas and hostels for personal use items and stationery, books, etc. as well as for the students of hostels at the district, division and municipal levels.
