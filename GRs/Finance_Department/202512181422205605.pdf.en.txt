The Proposal:
Appendix V to the Maharashtra Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1982 prescribes Sample-7 for submission of proposals for retirement. In this form, the head of the office has to fill in the relevant information in the submitted form to ensure that the retired employee has a government visit from them or how departmental or judicial proceedings are going on against him or her. This information is sought from the head of the Subordinate Office from all previous offices during the employee's service period. This includes "No-payment Certificate and No-Departmental Inquiry Certificate." In fact, there is no provision in the Maharashtra Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1982 for such a certificate. It has been observed that the practice of asking for "no-payment certificates" has also started, especially when seeking information from the previous office regarding departmental inquiries. In the absence of this information, the full proposal for retirement is not sent to the Accountant General's office within the stipulated time, as this information is not received on time. There is a delay in sending the proposal as it takes time to wait for this information. As a result, the pension benefits are received late by the retirees concerned. The employee's family suffers financially as the subsistence of the retired employee is on a pension. It has been highlighted that after so many years of service in government service, the treatment received in this regard shows an insensitive attitude. It is under the consideration of the Government to take steps in this regard and accordingly, the following instructions are being issued.
the Government Circular
The procedure for final pay certificate has been amended by the Government decision No. 2 in the above context. Accordingly, there will no longer be a need to separately call for "no-departmental inquiry certificate" and "no-payment certificate" if the instructions in the said Government decision are strictly followed. However, accordingly, with regard to the information required in pursuance of the Departmental Inquiry in Rule 132 of the Maharashtra Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1982 and Sample-7 mentioned in Annexure V, the following instructions are being issued:
