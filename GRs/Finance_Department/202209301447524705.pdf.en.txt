Similarly, since the publication of the Programme Budget is to be made available to the Members of the Legislature on the same day or on the next day after the Budget is presented to the Legislature in the Budget Session, the Programme Budget should be made available online to the Legislature within the prescribed time and only the required copies of the records should be printed. The department should make the program of its department available on the website of the budget department. The online link should be made available on the website of the state government and the legislature. This link should also be made available to the sites where the budget publications of the Finance Department are available. The department should take immediate action in this regard.
The Ministerial Departments are required to print the Programme Budgets for the year 2023-24 in the Government Press designated for printing the Programme Budgets. Regarding the printing arrangement of the programme budget, the Directorate of Government Printing and Stationery, Mumbai vide letter No. (b) By 1941, all the Ministries were notified. There has been no change in it. If the departments have any problem regarding this printing system, then the program budgets for the year 2023-24 should be printed after discussing with the Director, Government Printing and Stationery, Mumbai.

In doing so, you should prepare your manuscripts taking into account the instructions in the circular referred to above and follow the following schedule carefully. Primarily, the Estimates Committee should consider the recommendations made from time to time on the programme budget and re-examine their publications before sending them for final printing.
During the year 2013-14, due to late submission of programme budgets by some departments to the Legislative Assembly and before discussion on their budgetary demands in the House, the Government has decided to withdraw the programme. Opposition leaders raised the issue with the group leader as the members were not available. At that time, Ma. The Assembly Speaker had suggested action against the departments which do not submit the programme budget within the time limit.
