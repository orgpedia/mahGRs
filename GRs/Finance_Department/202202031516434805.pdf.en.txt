(b) The limit of devolution of funds under Centrally Sponsored/ Externally Aided Schemes to Central and State Governments is being increased to 100%. However, the actual date of disbursement of funds in this regard
The provisions of the Governing Decision dated 14th October, 2021 shall continue to apply. The sanction of Planning Department/ Social Justice Department/ Tribal Development Department and Finance Department, as required, should be obtained from the original source of the supplementary demand before disbursement of the funds for the supply demands for July, 2021 and December, 2021.
Before disbursing the above funds, the funds should be disbursed taking into account the instructions in the Annexure accompanying the Government Decision dated 14th October, 2021.
Since the savings in the budgetary provision will be useful in achieving the annual targets set under the Maharashtra Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Rules, the powers of the administrative departments to reallocate the budgetary provisions are being suspended and the administrative departments should not reallocate the funds without obtaining the approval of the Finance Department for mandatory expenditure in respect of reallocation and the Planning/ Social Justice/ Tribal Development Department and Finance Department as required for programme expenditure. Also, the unspent amount should be deposited in government accounts if the funds were previously drawn and kept in bank/ self-financing accounts.
(5) It shall be ensured that the funds made available to the administrative departments within the aforesaid limits are spent in the distribution to the field offices or administrative departments under them. These funds shall not be kept lying unutilized in the bank accounts of their subordinate officers/ boards/ corporations, in their own provident fund accounts or outside the government accounts.
The administrative departments, while distributing and spending the funds as mentioned above, should strictly follow the guidelines and prevailing norms issued earlier by the Planning and Finance Department, the delegation of financial powers and the instructions given by the Finance Department from time to time.
Further, the instructions issued and received from the Finance Department from time to time regarding the proceedings regarding the proposals to be purchased by the end of this financial year should be strictly followed.
