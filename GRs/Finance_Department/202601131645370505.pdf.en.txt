Reference No. 1 The decision on the Committee constituted under the Government Decision of the Finance Department here was under the consideration of the Government.
The Government's Decisions:
The targets were set for women agents assigned to work on registration of undocumented taxpayers under business tax, recovery of business tax arrears; however, the targets were not met for women agents. Also, there has been little response to agent certificate renewals.
Also, the computerisation of the state tax department has simplified the processes of online registration, filing returns, using the GRAS system for tax collection, obtaining professional information available with various government agencies. Also, while businesses come to register for GST, they are also urged to register for business tax. With all these factors, agents are no longer required to perform the work of registration of undocumented taxpayers, recovery of business tax arrears, etc. It is also recommended that the Study Committee on Reorganisation of Governmental Committees, in accordance with the Government Decision dated 28.4.2025 of the Department of Finance regarding transfer of business tax from the State Government to the Civil Liberties Institutions, need not be reconstituted by abolishing the District Level Committee. Hence, the Government has decided to issue No. Taxation-1102 / Q. 66/2002 Taxation-3, dated 28.5.2002 being cancelled.
