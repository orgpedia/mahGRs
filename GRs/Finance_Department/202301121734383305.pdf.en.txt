The procedure for sanction of Subsidiary Grants under Rule 149, Annexure 22 of the Bombay Finance Rules, 1959 has been laid down. Subsidies are provided to educational institutions, local self-government institutions, co-operative societies, as well as for educational scholarships, etc. Subsidiary Grants are required to submit its utilization certificate in the prescribed format to the Accountant General's Office within one year from the date of sanction of the grant. Subsidies are of two types: conditional and unconditional. Among them, only the utility certificate regarding the payment of conditional grants is required to be submitted to the Accountant General's Office. However, the order of grant-in-aid issued by the administrative departments does not clearly state whether the grant is' conditional' or' unconditional'. Therefore, the payment submitted to the Treasury by the Drawing and Disbursing Officer is also not stamped as' conditional' or' unconditional'. As a result, the Accountant General's office does not have a clear understanding of whether the grant is' conditional' or' unconditional' and all payments are included in the list of pending utility certificates, assuming they are' conditional'. It has been observed by the Government that there is a gradual increase in the number and amount of pending payments for utility certificates.
In order to facilitate the Drawing and Disbursing Officers, Treasury Offices and the Accountant General's Office to clearly classify the payment of Subsidiary Grants as' Conditional' and' Unconditional', it was under the consideration of the Government to fix separate Maharashtra Treasury Rules payment patterns for the payment of' Conditional' and' Unconditional' Subsidiary Grants.
Government's decision
The payments of subsidy are submitted to the Treasury under Rule 391 of the Maharashtra Treasury Rules, 1968 by the Drawing and Disbursing Officers. The payment of' unconditional' grant-in-aid to the treasury should henceforth be made in the form of payment under Maharashtra Treasury Rules-44 (A). A sample is available in the attached document. The payment of' conditional' grant-in-aid should be submitted in the form of Maharashtra Treasury Rule-44 as before.
At present, payments under headings 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 54 and 55 are submitted to the Treasury in the form of Maharashtra Treasury Rules-44. Out of these, the payments under the head of detailed head-36, Subsidiary Grants-Salaries should henceforth be made in the payment format of Maharashtra Treasury Rules-44 (A). The payment of grants to be budgeted under the detailed head-36, which

The grant of such payments is' unconditional' as they are made through a customised service delivery system and are meant for salary purposes only.
According to the Maharashtra Budget Rulebook, Volume-1, Chapter-6, Rule 98, the government provides a part of the tax to the local bodies through budgeted sources. These include Land Revenue Cess, Stamp Duty Share, Relative Subsidy, Incentive Subsidy, Increased Cess, Panipatty Cess as per the Maharashtra Zilla Parishad and Panchayat Samiti Act, 1961 and Gram Panchayat Land Cess, Minor Mineral and Stamp Duty under the Gram Panchayat Act, 1958. This tax is part of the self-income of the local bodies and is collected by the government and distributed through budgetary provisions. Such grants are' unconditional' as they are mandatory and un-tied in nature.
The fund is budgeted under the head 3604 with the detailed head 31-Performing Subsidy and drawn from the treasury on the payment pattern of Maharashtra Treasury Rule-44. Since the grants-in-aid are a source of income for the local bodies, they are also' unconditional' grants. Subsidiary Grants under the above objectives shall henceforth be drawn in the same form as in Maharashtra Treasury Rules 44- (a).
Stamp duty and share of Goods and Services Tax as ancillary subsidy to Urban Local Bodies such as Municipalities, Nagar Panchayats, Municipal Corporations etc. are also sources of income of the respective Local Bodies. Henceforth, such ancillary grants shall also be drawn from the Treasury in the form of payment under Rule 44 (a) of the Maharashtra Treasury Rules.
Further, in order to reduce the pendency of Utilization Certificates, the Administrative Departments, while issuing the orders of Subsidiary Grants, should clearly mention in the order whether the Subsidiary Grants are' conditional' or' unconditional'.
If the grant is' conditional', the terms and conditions should be mentioned in the order. Also the order should clearly mention whether or how the utilization certificate has been submitted in line with the utilization of the subsidy disbursed earlier.
The Accounts and Accounts Officer and all Treasury Officers shall ensure that the payment of Subsidiary Grants as aforesaid is made only after submission of separate forms 44 and 44 (a). Also, if the previous utility certificates are pending to be submitted, the concerned department/ office should not approve the payment of the ancillary subsidy under that head.
The Accountant General's Office shall take appropriate action to remove the payments of the Subsidiary Grants pending with the Accountant General's Office for the purpose of the Certificate of Utilization as per paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 above from the list of pending payments.
The details of pending subsidy payments for Utilization Certificate are available on the website of the Accountant General http:// cag.gov.in/ ae/ mumbai/ en under the option of online services voucher reconciliation> (password- Password@1). All administrative departments and their subordinate field offices should immediately submit utilization certificates of such pending payments to the Accountant General's office. It may be noted that in case of payments pending at the end of March, 2022, the disbursement of Subsidiary Grants under the respective scheme shall be discontinued with effect from 1st April, 2023.
