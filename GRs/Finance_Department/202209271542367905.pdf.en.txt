Madam Cama Marg, Hutatma Rajguru Chowk,

Date of release: September 27, 2022
Reference: Government Resolution No. Narrow 1010/ S.No.68/ Part III/ Section 5, Sec. 22.1.2013
Preamble: Copies of the supply of goods and services made by them to the contractors/ suppliers are provided by various departments of the government. Grant is also disbursed to the grantee institutions from time to time for specific purpose. In order to avoid delay in disbursement by the Government to such various taxpayers, all payments to be made through Treasury/ Sub-Treasury shall be made through CMP system provided by State Bank of India directly.
After the information of the payments passed by the Treasury Office under this government decision was made available on the CMP system, the Drawing and Disbursing Officer was given 10 days to check the payment of the payments included in it and authorize it. If the payment is not authorized during this period, an extension of 2 days is granted by the Treasury authorities. However, at present, since the utilization of CMP system has stabilized, it was under consideration of the Government to reduce the time limit for authorization of CMP to be provided in order to further enhance the speed of delivery.
Government's decision
The Treasury/ Sub-Treasury officials shall authorize the disbursement of payments authorized on the CMP system by ensuring the regular verification of the bank account number and the details of the disbursement within 7 days. If the drawing and disbursing authorities do not authorize the payment during this period, all such payments will be disabled on the CMP system. The Drawing and Disbursing Officer shall write to the Treasury/ Sub-Treasury Officer with the reasons for the delay in the form indicated in the accompanying Annexure for re-activation of the disabled supplies. Thereafter, such services will be restored on CMP system for 3 days. It shall be the responsibility of the Drawing and Disbursing Officer to authorize the re-operationalized supplies of the Treasury on the CMP system within a period of 3 days in any case.
