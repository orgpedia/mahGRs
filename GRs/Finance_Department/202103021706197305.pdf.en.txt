Read- 1. Government Decision, Water Resources Department No. BGM-1010/ (392/2010) Meaning-1, D. Decision of the Government, Finance Division No. 2015/ No. 06/ Koshasra-5, Dec. 22, 2010 On the 27th September 2016
Preamble: The Government is providing grants to various Irrigation Development Corporations functioning under the Water Resources Department to meet the capital expenditure and these grants are sanctioned under various schemes for various irrigation projects. The amount so sanctioned is drawn from the Consolidated Fund of the Government and transferred to the respective accounts in the respective treasuries authorized for the Corporations. The Corporation withdraws the said funds from its own provident fund account and transfers the same to its operating accounts in commercial banks.
(ii) the purpose for which the grant is sanctioned by the Government. For that purpose, it is deposited in commercial banks outside the government's account for a long time without incurring expenditure in the relevant financial year. This is a waste of government funds and is in conflict with the government's economic policy. At the same time, the government does not have immediate access to updated information on subsidy disbursements and actual expenditure. Considering all these aspects, the government was considering to link the existing private accounts of various Irrigation Development Corporations functioning under the Water Resources Department with the" Budget Estimation, Distribution and Control System (BEAMS)" of the government and provide the facility to the Irrigation Development Corporations under the Water Resources Department to utilize the capital grants distributed by the government through this system. For this, the National Informatics Centre, Pune has extended the Beams system to create a facility of" Virtual Self-Reposit Account." The government has already taken the decision in this regard.

Government's decision
1) The self-financing accounts opened in the treasury for various Irrigation Development Corporations functioning under the Water Resources Department will be linked to the" BEAMS" system. The grants for capital expenditure received from the state government budget will be deposited by the corporations in their own registers as per the existing procedure. These personal ledger accounts will not be controlled by the respective treasury but by the Virtual Personal Ledger Account System developed under BEAMS. However, these accounts will be managed by the Treasury as per the extant procedures.
(2) The payment of capital expenditure by the Irrigation Development Corporation and its subordinate offices shall be made directly to the bank account of the payee through virtual self-financing accounts instead of through the commercial bank's circulation account as is the practice. For this, the existing system of CMP, State Bank of India, will be used to provide funds to the treasury.
