However, if the funds are not adequately available within the disbursed limit, the funds should be submitted to the Budget Branch of the Finance Department for disbursement. However, if the Central Government funds for the previous year are to be spent in the current year, it will be mandatory to obtain the consent of the Planning Department, Social Justice and Special Assistance Department, Tribal Development Department and Finance Department, as the case may be.

If all the items are reimbursed as per the checklist of the mentioned items, the department should disburse the funds at their level, otherwise such proposal will have to be approved by the administrative departments, where necessary, with the approval of the Planning Department/ Social Justice and Special Assistance Department/ Tribal Development Department, the Expenditure Branch and the Budget Branch of the Finance Department.
Also, while sending such approval proposals to the Finance Department, the proposals should be sent to the Finance Department for approval with suitable reasons, clearly stating the terms and conditions on which relaxation is required.
18. It is observed that except for the expenditure on salaries, the expenditure on other items is not proportionate during the financial year. Despite the availability of funds, it cannot be spent due to lack of process. As a result, most of the provisions remain unutilized throughout the year and are spent towards the end of the financial year without adequate preparation. Every year, a large amount of budgetary allocations are seen to be spent in the last month of the financial year. Due to all these things, financial discipline is not being followed. No development works take place. Therefore, the administrative departments should properly plan the expenditure for the year 2023-24. The administrative departments should review this at the level of administrative department heads every month and ensure that there is no rush of expenditure in the last month of the year and give such instructions to the controlling authorities. If there is any financial irregularity in this regard, the administrative department will be responsible. Also, the provisions of the departments whose expenditure ratio is less than 50% at the end of December, 2023 will be reduced in a proportionate manner while preparing the revised estimates and the entire responsibility will be of the concerned administrative departments.
In addition to the above terms and conditions, the departments are advised that it shall be the responsibility of the departments to comply with the provisions of the State Government's Working Manual, Financial Manual, Budget Rule Book and all the terms and conditions while making expenditure.
