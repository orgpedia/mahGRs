Circular:
As usual, the Supplementary Statement of Expenditure for the current financial year under Article 205 of the Constitution of India will be presented in the December, 2021 session of the Legislature. In view of the provisions of the Constitution as well as the Maharashtra Budget Rule Book, the Supplementary Statement of Demands/ Expenditure in respect of the matter mentioned below is submitted to the Legislature.
(a) matters in respect of which no supplementary demands or appropriations have so far been submitted to the Legislature in respect of the amounts sanctioned or to be made out of the Contingency Fund.
(b) only such matters as may be prescribed by order of the Court and the expenditure in the form of loads and the expenditure on new matters which may be planned to be incurred after obtaining approval from the Legislature by way of a supplementary demand.
(a) Typical demands relating to bringing the expenditure on new works to the notice of the Legislature.
Since March 2021, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the State has been on the rise again. As it is having an adverse impact on the state's economy by causing a huge fall in tax and non-tax revenue in the state, the date of disbursement of limited funds for the fiscal year 2021-22 has been given for very urgent and binding expenditure targets. Beams have been made on the system through a government circular dated October 14, 2021. In view of the Covid situation in the current financial year, there is a need to prioritize expenditure and take measures accordingly to keep the state's finances under control while limiting the government's bound expenditure. Therefore, in such a situation, it has become imperative for the departments to submit supplementary demand proposals only for the following purposes.
(1) The demands for supplies/ appropriations which have not yet been submitted to the Legislature in respect of the amounts sanctioned or to be made out of the Contingency Fund,

(2) For the Central and State share of the Central/ Externally aided/ Centrally Sponsored Schemes, where no provision has been made in the budget or more than 50% of the provision has been made and where funds are required, for such matters, (3) for which no budgetary provision has been made in the prescribed manner, (4) for matters where more than 75% of the budgetary provision has been made and more provision is required,
In view of the above, all the Ministries/ Departments are required to send all the Supplementary Demands for Compulsory and Programme Expenditure in respect of the above mentioned items along with the proposal in Annexure-A and the information in Annexure-B, C and D depending upon the procedure, to the Department of Finance for registration in the first instance.
