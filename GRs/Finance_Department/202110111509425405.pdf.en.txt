circular
The dates on which the Administrative and Controlling Officer of the Ministry is required to send its budget proposals to the Finance Department are prescribed in Annexure 2 of the Maharashtra Budget Rules, inter alia. In order to enable the Department of Finance to take appropriate action in this regard before finalizing the Budget Estimates and including them in the Budget, the Heads of Departments and Administrative Divisions of the Ministry shall ensure to send their Budget Estimates for the year 2022-2023 and new items and revised estimates for the year 2021-2022 to the Department of Finance on or before the dates mentioned in paragraph 4 below.
2. It has been the experience of the Finance Department that even if the information is received as per the prescribed dates, the time available to the Finance Department to complete the work as per schedule is limited. Budget estimates received from administrative departments need to be scrutinized in the Finance Department before they are collated for placing before the Cabinet and changes suggested by the Cabinet have to be incorporated before such estimates are finally printed for submission to the Legislature.
So if any essentials are found late, the entire schedule gets disrupted.

Government Circular No: ANTHAYAN- 2021/ PR No.35/ BUDGET- 1
The information (in supplementary form) showing the details of mandatory and programme expenditure to be made and the provision of funds outside the Centrally Sponsored State Budget should be provided to the Rural Development Department and Urban Development Department within the prescribed time frame without fail, otherwise their budget estimates will not be included in the publication of the Finance Department. The concerned department will be responsible for this.
Preparation of accurate budget estimates and revised estimates.
5.1 Since the nature of the annual programme and the need to raise additional resources for such a programme are entirely dependent on the revenue projections for the coming year, it is essential to prepare budget estimates of the receipts and expenditure, particularly the mandatory expenditure, on a realistic and unbiased basis. It has been found that there is a lot of delay in getting their budget estimates from the controlling authorities or the administrative department to the finance department and in some cases they do not come at all. Because of this not only the budget schedule gets disturbed but the budget estimates have to be prepared on the basis of insufficient information. Based on these facts and figures, it's just a guess. Therefore, the control officers should prepare the estimates related to them very carefully and send them on time and as per the prescribed schedule. Despite repeated suggestions made by the Public Accounts Committee and the Estimates Committee that the department should prepare realistic estimates, it has been found that proper explanation, trend of the estimates and other important details are not being provided. Estimates should be made carefully to ensure that the promises made to the Estimates Committee are implemented. So that in the strict investigation done by the Public Accounts Committee, such estimates will be proved to be true and will match the actual amount. Therefore, all the administrative departments should bring to the notice of all the estimating officers under their administrative control the need to prepare budget estimates on the basis of the provisions of the Maharashtra Budget Rules and the experience of preparing budget estimates.
5.2 The Committee on Estimates and the Committee on Public Accounts of the Legislature have already brought to the notice of the Government the discrepancy between the estimates and the actual amounts and are of the opinion that such discrepancy can be avoided if estimates of deposits and expenditure are prepared very carefully. Therefore, it is being brought to the notice of the administrative departments that they should convey their requirements to the heads of the departments by informing them about the revised estimates for the current year as well as to take very strict care while preparing the budget estimates for the next year.
5.3 The budgetary and year-end final revised grants sanctioned under the objective of" Salaries" under the Government Decision, Finance Division No. Estimate 1095/ CR-14/ Budget-1, dated 4th November, 1995 shall not be reallocated to any other objective. This makes it important to make accurate predictions. While presenting the exact estimate of the salary target, the department should also present the designations of the posts, the number of posts filled and vacant and the government decision on the creation of the post.
Further, instructions regarding payment of services through external mechanism under the head of 10- Contractual Services have been issued by the Department of Finance, Government Circular No. Accordingly, the payment for all types of services carried out by external agencies should also be covered under the target head" 10 Contractual Services." Page 4 of 15
# Page 5
Government Circular No: ANTHAYAN- 2021/ PR No.35/ BUDGET- 1
All the departments should ensure that in the Budget 2022-23, necessary provision of funds for providing services through external agencies is made in the Budget under the head" 10 Contractual Services."
5.4 While preparing the revised estimates for the current year, the Administrative Departments shall ensure that they are based on correct and controlled information on the progress of deposits and expenditure. Further, detailed justification for the discrepancy between the original estimates of deposits and expenditure should be provided at the time of sending the revised estimates. Circular to the Government on the action taken on the recommendations of the Fifteenth Report of the Public Accounts Committee, 1983-84, Finance Division, No. BGT. 2384/226/ BUD-2, dated 30th May, 1984 is being brought to the notice of all the Ministries/ Departments and all the Heads of Departments under their administrative control and they are requested to strictly implement the instructions contained therein.
5.5 The Administrative Department, Controlling Officer and Drawing and Disbursing Officer are requested to take note of the instructions contained in the Government Circular, Finance Department, No. BGT 2681/16/ BUD-2, dated 1st March 1982 while sending the revised estimates. Also, the Controlling Officer should ensure that the revised estimates of the items included in the budget based on the actual expenditure for the first 4, 8 and 9 months are sent as annexure to the revised estimates in the prescribed format.
5.6 Expenditure in excess of the sanctioned grant is a budgetary irregularity and does not reflect proper and effective control over expenditure. In this regard, the fifth report of the Public Accounts Committee of 1995-96 has expressed very adverse views. It is the joint responsibility of the Controlling Authority and the Administrative Department to take utmost care in preparing the revised estimates and to ensure that the expenditure does not exceed the approved or revised estimates. If there is a possibility of spending more than the sanctioned grant and if that expenditure is unavoidable, then the prior approval of the Finance Department should be taken for that expenditure. In this regard, the administrative departments should instruct all the controlling officers to take proper care, and if the expenditure is not shared in the approved or revised grant, the controlling officer will be held personally responsible and it will be taken seriously in his confidential report, and strict disciplinary action can be taken and the officers concerned will be eligible for disciplinary action such as stopping the salary increase or demotion according to the type of irregularity.
5.7 As there is no sufficient" weighted" provision under the relevant head of accounts for expenditure as per the Court's award, the number of cases for advance from the Contingency Fund and the number of supplementary demands to be submitted for reimbursement of advances has increased considerably. However, in order to avoid such a situation, all the departments under their head should consider such" weighted expenditure" of the last five years and accordingly propose adequate" weighted" allocation in the budget for 2022-2023. The circular number of this department is estimated. 1087/81/ Budget-1, dated 5th February, 1987. Except in exceptional circumstances, if supplementary demands have to be submitted during the year, the responsibility will be entirely on the concerned officers.

New issues 6.
6.1 While preparing the new expenditure proposals for inclusion in the Budget, the Administrative Departments should take into account the following revised financial limits in respect of new items of expenditure and new major constructions as per Government Decision, Finance Division, No. BGT 1093/67/ I/ BUD-2, dated 19th August, 1995:
Minimum annual recurring expenditure of Rs.200,000/- (Rs. two million).
Minimum annual non-recurring expenditure of Rs.20,000/- (Rs. twenty million).
Cases involving both recurring and non-recurring expenses 20,00,000/- (Rs. twenty million).
6.2 Also to their attention is the Government Circular, Finance Department, No. BGT. 1093/67/2/ BUD-2, dated 21st August, 1995. Accordingly, as per the recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee, it has been decided to display all new constructions in separate Annexure to the Part-II Expenditure Detailed Budget Estimates of the respective Administrative Divisions from the Budget Estimates of 1996-1997. However, the concerned administrative departments should take care to send the information for the year 2022-2023 accordingly.
6.3 The attention of the Administrative Departments is also drawn to the Government Circular, Finance Division, No. BGT 1077/95/ BUD-5, dated 19th May 1977. That circular emphasizes the need for putting a cap on the number of supplementary demands during the period of the year. Further, instructions have also been issued to ensure that the number of contingency fund advances is limited as per the Government Circular, Finance Division No.Akni 1096/ PR No. 10/ Budget-1, dated 26th April 1996. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to try to allocate in the budget for all" new" expenses. For this purpose, the Government Circular, Finance Department, No. BGT. The only way forward is for the Planning Department and/ or the Finance Department to properly scrutinize the new matter and get it passed by them, as envisaged in the 1063/17, dated 8th May 1963. Accordingly, the administrative departments should ensure that all their new items to be included in the budget for the next year have been properly scrutinized by the Planning Department and/ or the Finance Department in advance i.e. before December 1, 2021 and the new item has been approved by the Expenditure Priority Committee. The Administrative Departments shall also ensure that the proposals for such new items are duly approved by the Cabinet before forwarding the proposals based on the policy or changes in the existing policy to the Finance Department/ Planning Department for inclusion in the Budget. The administrative departments should show their new matters to the concerned ministers of their department and take their approval and prioritize accordingly.
6.4 The proposal for creation of new posts under Government Resolution, Finance Division, No.1001/ PR No. 29/2001/ Financial Reforms, dated 10th September, 2001 has been sent to the Committee constituted under the Chairmanship of the Chief Secretary for detailed examination after obtaining the approval of the Finance Division and the Planning and Finance Division in the matter of expenditure plans under the programme and after the approval of the Committee, the proposal for creation of new posts in the pay scale of Rs.12,000 and above has been approved by the Cabinet.

Government Circular No: ANTHAYAN- 2021/ PR No.35/ BUDGET- 1
It should be placed before the Cabinet for its prior approval and thus no order for creation of any post should be issued without the approval of the Cabinet. While sending new matters regarding creation of new posts, Rs. The proposal for creation of new posts in the pay scale of Rs 12,000 and above should be given a clear certificate that the Cabinet has approved it. Similarly, the Department should ensure that all its proposals relating to the coming year's projections/ new items are complete in all respects and the necessary information is provided to them.
6.5 The administrative departments should ensure that all the preparatory works for the implementation of the new schemes are completed before the coming year. Therefore, it should be ensured that the provisions made in connection with these schemes are not reduced or refunded. Part I- Government notification in the matter of preparing the average cost of posts while preparing the final annual recurring cost in the case of new items, Finance Department, No. FNR. 1067/111538-7, dated 5th May 1970. The final annual recurring expenditure should also include expenditure on other items of recurring nature and salaries and allowances of employees.
7. Objective Classification
7.1 When the amounts credited do not generally correspond to the other heads or objectives or the amounts cannot be easily classified under that particular head or objectives, in such rare cases only the administrative departments shall ensure that the head' Other expenditure' in the expenditure estimates and the head' Other deposits' in the deposit estimates are used in the particulars and review the deposits/ expenditures generally recorded under the head and, if necessary, take necessary action for reclassification in consultation with the Finance Department and the Accountant General.
7.2 In order to have parity and consistency with the revised targets of the Central Government, detailed instructions have been given to revise the existing targets as per the Government Circular, Finance Division, No.BGT. 10.01/ P.S. No.1562/ Budget-2, dated 1st July 2006. It has been amended vide Government Resolution, Finance Division, No. BGT 10.01/ PS No.1562/ Budget-2, dated 16th January, 2008. A detailed statement of the existing targets and their indicators, revised targets and their indicators and the specific activities that are expected to be included in the expenditure in these revised targets is annexed to the Government Decision dated 16th January, 2008. However, after a thorough study of the statement of the circular/ government decision, the budget estimates for the year 2022-2023 should be sent according to these revised targets. The list of standard headings is given in Annexure-I along with this circular for easy reference. But the experience is that many departments have not used objective classification while proposing provisions. The departments should ensure that the budgetary provisions for 2022-2023 are strictly target oriented. GOVERNMENT DECISION, FINANCE DEPARTMENT, NO. BGT. 20.10/ PR.
66/ Budget-2, dated 10th August, 2010, the State Government, on the lines of the Central Government, has also revised the Government Resolution dated 16th January, 2008, and revised the target from the year 2011-12. 35 Grants and Objectives for Capital Formation Top No. 36 It has been decided to use this Subsidiary Grants (Salaries).

7.3. As per the instructions contained in paragraph 2 of the Government Circular, Finance Department, No. BGT 1083/279/ BUD-1, dated 30th June, 1983, while sending the Budget Estimates/ Revised Estimates for the purpose of" Salaries," it should be divided into (a) Salaries, (b) Dearness Allowance, (c) House Rent Allowance, (d) City Supplementary Allowance, (e) Other Allowances separately and without fail.

7.5 The Office of the Accountant General has examined the expenditure in the budget publication for 2017-18 and has found the deficiencies in the budget. TM/ CH-1/ Budget Scrutiny 2018-19/ 516 dated 13th July, 2018 has been communicated to this Department. Copies of this letter have already been made available to the concerned departments by the Budget Offices. The detailed Budget Estimates of revenue collections show a large amount of deposits in the group head" Other Deposits" under the sub-heading" 800 Other Deposits" of many departments. Since it is not clear what form/ nature of these amounts are, it is necessary for the concerned departments to take a separate sub-group head for this.
7.6. It has been observed that after the amalgamation of Plan and Non-Plan expenditure, there are discrepancies in some of the sub-headings. Add a new subheading if needed.
has been suggested. Therefore, the departments should take appropriate action to remove the removed subtitles.
