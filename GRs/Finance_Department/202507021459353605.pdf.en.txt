Illustration - (If NIDA 80% and RIDF 20% the total loan amount will be Rs.15000 cr. Drawal Application Date 11 "Feb, 2025 RIDF Roll - 5%
NIDA RoI -- 'A' which is to be calculated with a formula as follows:
0.80 x RoI on NIDA Loan 1.6. + 0.20 x RoI on RIDF Loan
= RoI of SGS of the latest tenor of 7 years or above
Effective NIDA Rol (SGS rate is 7.12%, issue date is 4" Feb, 2025)
0.80 x A+ 0.20 x 5.00 = 7.12
0.80A + 1.00 = 7.12
0.80A = 7.12 -1.00
0.80A = 6.12
A = 6.12/0.80
A= 7.65
Therefore Effective RoI of NIDA is 7.65%
Note: a) The date of receipt of complete drawal application as per Annexure will be reckoned as the date of Drawal application, accordingly the RoI will be arrived.
b) Release will be made by NABARD in three working days from the date of drawal application.
