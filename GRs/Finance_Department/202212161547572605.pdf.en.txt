Preamble- Under the existing provisions relating to air travel, air travel is not permissible for officers of the rank of Secretary. If it is not possible to reach on time by any other means/ route only for judicial and legislative business, then air travel can be done with the written prior permission of the Secretary of the concerned administrative department. Air travel is not permitted for any other reason. However, it is not always possible for the Secretary to attend all important government business, for example, to attend important meetings with the Central Government and to receive/ follow up grants for Centrally Sponsored Schemes.

In this regard, the State Government has given permission to allow air travel concession to State Government officers/ employees. The Government has issued a decision on 21.01.2011.
