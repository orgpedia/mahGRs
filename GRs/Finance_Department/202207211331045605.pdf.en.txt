Preamble As per the Government decisions of Reference Nos. 1 to 8 above, serving and retired State Government officers/ employees and officers of All India Services and Dy. Group Insurance based Medical Reimbursement Insurance Scheme was introduced for Government Officers/ Employees and Family Pensioners who retired after 30.06.2011. Now, after the review of the scheme, the government has decided to make changes in the scheme to increase the coverage of the insurance cover scheme for serving and retired officers/ employees. 01.07.2022 to D. The matter of renewal for the period 30.06.2023 was under consideration of the Government.
The government has decided to introduce a medical insurance scheme. 01.07.2022 to D. The State Government officers/ employees and All India Service officers retiring on 30.06.2023 will not be compulsorily covered under the scheme. From the current year, only officers/ employees who retired in the year 2022-23 and serving officers/ employees of government services will be eligible to join the scheme by voluntarily paying the required annual installment.
During 2021-22, the total premium amount collected under the scheme is Rs. 26.47 crore. Further, as on 30.06.2022, the claim ratio has increased to 106%. As the policy is still due till 24.07.2022, the insurance company has projected an overall incurred claim ratio of 120% considering the number of claims arising during the period.
In view of the declining enrolment of members in the medical reimbursement insurance umbrella scheme, the rates of premiums for working officers/ employees in the age group of 18-35 years, 36-45 years and 46-58 years are being revised to increase the participation of employees in 2022-23.
