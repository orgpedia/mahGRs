The pilot project will be implemented from April 1, 2021 at Maharashtra Krishna Valley Development Corporation, Pune. Thereafter. This system will be used on a pilot basis in all the Irrigation Corporations under the Water Resources Department from 01.08.2021.

(i) Konkan Irrigation Development Corporation, Thane; (ii) Godavari Marathwada Irrigation Development Corporation, Chhatrapati Sambhaji Nagar; (iii) Tapi Valley Irrigation Development Corporation, Jalgaon and (iv) Vidarbha Irrigation Development Corporation, Nagpur are not implementing the Virtual PLA mechanism. Proposals for approval of utilization of the last year's non-recurring grant from the Irrigation Development Corporations and the demand for use of cheques in case of transfer of funds from one Corporation to another Corporation are received frequently with the approval of the Finance Department.
In this background, the Government was contemplating to issue final directions to the 4 Irrigation Development Corporations mentioned in the said paragraph 3 and their subordinate Drawing and Disbursing Officers to expedite the utilization of capital grants received from the State Government for construction, rehabilitation and land acquisition on priority basis.
