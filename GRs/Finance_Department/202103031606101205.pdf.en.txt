Government Resolution No. Composite 2020/ S. No. 51/20/ T.P.S.5
Madam Cama Marg, Hutatma Rajguru Chowk,
Ministry, Mumbai- 400 032.
The date: March 3, 2021.
Reference: Department of Finance, Government Resolution No. 51/20/ Koshasra-5, D. The March 13, 2020
Preamble: As per the decision of the Government in this regard, it has been decided to conduct banking transactions in Government offices, Public Sector Undertakings and Corporations through Nationalised Banks only.
Accordingly, only nationalised banks have been permitted to transact in government banking and to invest surplus funds held by PSUs and corporations. In addition, the official bank account for the purpose of salary and allowances of the Drawing and Disbursing Officer and the Personal Pension Bank Account of the pensioners have been approved by the nationalized banks that have signed an agreement with the government.
However, some departments had already started using the" Computing System" developed by some private banks to facilitate collection and disbursement of funds under their various schemes even before the aforesaid Government decision. Also, some departments have requested the Finance Department to use the computer systems developed by private banks in view of the latest technology based facilities being provided by private banks. Besides, the amount is deposited in the office bank accounts of the employees for a very short period. Therefore, private banks are being requested to give approval for wage purposes. If private banks are also considered in terms of pension distribution, the pensioners will have the option to open an account in the nearest bank. Considering all these factors, the government was considering allowing a limited number of private banks to handle government banking transactions.
GOVERNMENT DECISIONS: 1. Departments to use computer technology based systems/ services with the help of private banks for effective and speedy implementation of their various schemes, may seek the concurrence of the Finance Department. After that, follow the rules and follow the proper procedures. However, no additional charges will be levied by the private banks for availing such services and the funds will not be held in the bank for a period beyond T+ 1

The concerned department should take care of this. The concerned department should ensure compliance by seeking the required information (MIS) from the bank on a monthly basis and also provide this information to the finance department.

However, no funds other than salary and allowances of employees can be deposited in such bank accounts.
Pensioners can voluntarily open a pension account in any private bank approved by the government.
For the purposes of 2 and 3 above, private banks are required to enter into separate agreements with the government. The procedure for this is announced separately by the Finance Department.
If the bank wants to provide some additional services free of cost, the details of the same can be mentioned in the agreement.
It may be noted that there has been no change in the policy stated in the relevant government decision to prohibit government offices, public enterprises, corporations from investing additional funds or keeping fixed deposits in private banks.
