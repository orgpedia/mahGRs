Government Circular: Maharashtra Finance and Accounts Service has been established under the Government Resolution dated February 1965 for the purpose of harmonizing the financial matters of various administrative departments of the state, preparing budgets of the concerned departments, accounting and accounting, providing financial advice, etc. The officers of this service are working in various administrative departments of the government, corporations, municipal corporations, etc. and carry out financial affairs as representatives of the government.
The State Government provides grants-in-aid to all the Administrative Departments of the State Government, District Councils, Municipal Corporations, Municipalities, Universities, Corporations, Corporations, Companies, Government controlled institutions etc. As the government has control over this institution, the work of the department/ institution has been entrusted to the officers of Maharashtra Finance and Accounts Service.
Administrative divisions, district councils, municipal corporations, municipal councils, universities, corporations, etc.
Officers are provided by the Finance Department as per the approved format on the establishment. However, the process of mutual elevation/ demotion of posts for specified officers is being done frequently by the concerned department. As a result, the officers of the Maharashtra Finance and Accounts Service face difficulties in determining the reservation for the promotion of officers as" Cadre Controller Department," preparing point lists, sending demand letters for posts to the Maharashtra Public Service Commission, etc. Due to non-availability of posts for promotion, officers in the promotion chain face delay in promotion.
In view of the tendency of many departments to unilaterally relieve the officers of the Maharashtra Finance and Accounts Service, not to depute, appoint specific officers in mutual posts, appoint officers of other services as Chief Financial Officers instead of officers of the Maharashtra Finance and Accounts Service, the Government has decided to appoint officers of the Maharashtra Finance and Accounts Service in various departments of the Government by a Government Decision dated 8th February, 2018. However, this has not been implemented.
Based on the above, the following recommendations have been made.
(a) The instructions given by the Government under the decision of the Finance Department dated 08.02.2018 should be strictly followed.
(b) The Administrative Department/ Corporation/ Autonomous Body should demand the post as per the approved format of the post.
