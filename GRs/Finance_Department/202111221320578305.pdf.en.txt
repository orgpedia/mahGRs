It has come to the notice of the Government that State Government officers and employees belonging to Group-A, Group-B, Group-B (Non-Gazetted), Group-C and Group-D are being paid excess payment of Government dues on various occasions during their service, which are not payable to them as per rules or their entitlements and permissible under the Act. In some cases, where the overpayment has been found to be in future, an undertaking that the employee will return the amount to the government needs to be taken from the concerned government employee. As a result, it has come to the notice of the government that the employees are opposing it if recovery of such overpaid amount is initiated.

We cannot ignore the fact that in such cases, the employee, though disentitled, has pocketed the tax payers amount.

We, therefore, deem it appropriate to direct the Chief Secretary of the State of Maharashtra to issue appropriate directions to all the departments of the State Government and local authorities/ bodies, to mandate executing of undertakings from employees, who would be subject to pay fixation or calculations of increments or any similar calculations with regard to monetary benefits. It shall be stated that in such undertakings that they would refund excess amounts if subsequently found to have been paid in excess. This would be in the interest of the State Exchequer and would also control excess payments which cannot be recovered subsequently. The Chief Secretary shall consider the judgment delivered by the Hon'ble Apex Court in Jagdev Singh (Supra), wherein the Hon'ble Apex Court has concluded that if an undertaking is executed by such a beneficiary at the time of receiving monetary benefits, he would be liable to repay the said amount to the employer.
