Government Decision No: - Taxation-2025 / Q. No.19 / Taxation-3.
5th Floor, Main Building, Madam Cama Marg, Martyrdom Rajguru Chowk,
Mantralaya, Mumbai - 400 032.
Date: 28th April, 2025.
Introduction: - Business tax is an important source of revenue for the state government and is collected from individuals engaged in various professions, trades, jobs and employments. Business tax is administered and collected by the Goods and Services Tax Department.
However, there is increasing urbanisation in the state and thereby increasing responsibilities of urban local bodies. An increase in the limited revenue sources of urban local bodies is necessary to meet the growing responsibilities. Empowering them with additional revenue sources will increase their economic stability. If the urban local bodies get the business tax, their income will increase and local development works will get more funds. This will make the local administration more efficient. Tax collection will be more effective as urban local bodies have direct linkages with businesses and professions at the local level. The 4th and 5th State Finance Commissions have also recommended the transfer of business tax to local bodies. In fact, some states, such as Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Kerala, have transferred the collection of commercial taxes to both urban local bodies and panchayat raj institutions.
The transfer of business tax from the state government to urban local bodies is necessary if urban local bodies are to be financially empowered. Therefore, an in-depth study of this transfer is necessary. This requires a detailed study of the states that have transferred the business tax to the local bodies, how it has been done, what methodology has been adopted and what has been the impact on the local bodies, and how the local bodies have enabled the businesses to pay the business tax. Accordingly, a committee was set up to study how other states transferred business taxes from the state government to the local bodies.
