Mantralaya, Mumbai- 400 032
Date: June 6, 2023.
Introduction: Various works are carried out by the Public Works Department, Water Resources Department and other departments through tenders and various services are taken. The payment of these works/ services is delayed due to various reasons. Contractors go to court or arbitration to get the payment with interest. In case of delayed payment, the government has to pay the dues with interest as per the order of the arbitrator and the order of the court. The rate of interest is decided by the arbitrator or court on the basis of the case and the situation at that time. The government has to bear a huge financial burden as this rate is higher than the rate fixed by the Reserve Bank. Accordingly, a proposal to mention the rate of interest in the tender and contract for delayed payments was under consideration of the government.
Government Decision: The tender terms and conditions provide for arbitration by the Public Works Department, Water Resources Department and other departments. The terms and conditions of the tender as well as the agreement to be entered into pursuant thereto should specify that the amount of interest in respect of delayed payments, payments to be made as per arbitral award, payments to be made as per court case, etc. in respect of such works/ services contract shall be at the rate of+ 3% per annum of the Bank Rate announced by the Reserve Bank from time to time in accordance with the provisions of the Concession Agreement in the NHAI (National Highways Authority of India) project.
Administrative departments are requested to take action as per the provisions of this order. Subordinate offices should be informed about the action to be taken. All the Ministries/ Departments shall ensure that the necessary amendments in this regard are specifically made in the tender as well as in the agreement to be published hereinafter.
