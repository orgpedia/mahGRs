Circular:
As usual, the Supplementary Statement of Expenditure for the current financial year under Article 205 of the Constitution of India will be presented in the March, 2021 session of the Legislature. In view of the provisions of the Constitution as well as the Maharashtra Budget Rule Book, the Supplementary Statement of Demands/ Expenditure in respect of the matter mentioned below is submitted to the Legislature.
(a) matters in respect of which supplementary demands or appropriations have not yet been submitted to the Legislature in respect of amounts sanctioned or to be made out of the Contingency Fund.
(b) only such matters as may be prescribed by order of the Court and the expenditure in the form of loads and the expenditure on new matters which may be planned to be incurred after the approval of the Legislature by way of a supplementary demand.
(a) Typical demands relating to bringing the expenditure on new works to the notice of the Legislature.
2. In view of the massive fall in the tax and non-tax revenue of the State due to the lockdown imposed in the State due to the contagious diseases of COVID 6-19, instructions have been issued to all the departments through circulars dated 16th April, 2020 for the financial year 2020-2021 to first take fiscal measures to stimulate the fiscal cycle and then to plan fiscal measures for a tight fiscal measure only for the committed expenditure and the impact on the economy. The revenue situation of the state is likely to remain very serious due to the contagious diseases of Covid-19. Therefore, in such a situation, it has become imperative for the departments to submit supplementary demand proposals only for the following purposes.
(1) Requests for supplies not yet presented to the Legislature in respect of amounts sanctioned or to be made out of the Contingency Fund, (2) for provision to be made in a court of law.
(3) For matters where the Central/ Externally Aided/ Centrally Sponsored Schemes have not been provided in the budget for Central and State share or where more than 80% of the provision has been spent and funds are required,

(7) For matters where the provision under the targets of 10-Contractual Service and 02-Wage is insufficient for the remaining period of this financial year.
