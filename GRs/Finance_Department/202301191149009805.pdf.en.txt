Government's decision
As per the provisions of Rule 849 (b) of the Bombay Civil Services Rules, 1959, for a government accommodation provided on duty, a government employee has to pay a licence fee of 10 per cent of his salary or the standard rent of the accommodation, whichever is less.
The revised pay structure for the state government employees has been implemented from January 1, 2016. In view of these reforms, the question of revising the rate of license fee for government accommodation was under the consideration of the government. After considering all the aspects in this regard, the Government hereby order that as per the revised pay structure of the Government employees, the rates of license fee for different types of Government Accommodation provided at the place of duty shall be as shown in the table below and shall be uniformly applicable across the State. The licence fee shall be recovered for the type of accommodation actually occupied irrespective of the eligibility of the employees for paid accommodation.
