Government circular
Instructions regarding submission of pension cases through online mode have been issued as per the relevant government decision. The mobile number of the pensioner/ family pensioner is to be mentioned in the Sample No.8 of Form-1 accompanying the decision of the Government in question. However, in some of the retirement cases, as the mobile number is not available, the Accountant General's office is not able to inform the retired employee/ family pensioner about the status of his/ her pension related matter.
Accordingly, all the Heads of Offices are being advised that while submitting the pension/ family pension matter to the Accountant General's office, the Accountant General's office should be able to inform the pensioners/ family pensioners about the current status of their pension matter so that the mobile number of the pensioner/ family pensioner is included in his pension matter.
Don't be misquoted.
