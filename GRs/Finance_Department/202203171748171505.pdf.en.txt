Government Circular No: Fince-2021/ PR No.48/ Fince-3
(b) The remaining targets should be met with the approval of the Planning Department, Social Justice and Special Assistance Department, Tribal Development Department and Finance Department for the disbursement of funds under the programme and the Finance Department for the disbursement of funds for mandatory expenditure. Since there has been a huge shortfall in revenue receipts in the current financial year, it is necessary to disburse funds from the available funds only for unavoidable matters.
As the savings in the budgetary provision will be useful in achieving the annual targets set under the Maharashtra Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Rules, the administrative departments should not reallocate funds for the reallocation of budgetary provisions without obtaining the approval of the Finance Department for mandatory expenditure and the Planning Department, Social Justice and Special Assistance Department, Tribal Development Department and Finance Department for program expenditure as per requirement. Also, the unspent amount should be deposited in the government accounts if the funds were previously drawn and kept in the bank/ self-financing account.
(5) The funds made available to the Administrative Departments within the aforesaid limits shall be released to the Regional Offices or Administrative Departments under them. It should be ensured that the expenditure is definitely incurred by March 31, 2022. These funds shall not be kept lying unutilized in the bank accounts of their subordinate zonal officers/ boards/ corporations, in their personal provident fund accounts or outside the government accounts.
The administrative department shall strictly follow the guidelines and prevailing norms, delegation of financial powers and instructions given from time to time as mentioned in the Maharashtra Budget Rules Book and Financial Powers Rules Book and issued earlier by the Finance Department while distributing and spending the fund as above.
7. Wherever necessary, the Finance Department has been given the approval of the Planning Department, Social Justice and Special Assistance Department, Tribal Development Department. The Department may note that the same will be accepted up to 02.00 PM on 24th March, 2022. Also, the directory of such funds should be boldly mentioned as" Distribution/ Re-appropriation of funds for the year 2021-22." After this, the proposals/ objections of such matters will not be accepted in the Finance Department under any circumstances. The department should take note of it and take action accordingly. Also, such proposals received in the Registration Branch of the Finance Department should be immediately forwarded by the Registration Branch to the concerned Expenditure Branch. The proposal was submitted by the Expenditure Department on Friday with feedback after examining the issue. The Budget should be sent to the Department by 04.00 pm on March 25, 2022.
