(1) Department of Finance, Government Resolution No. 1011/ No. 15/ Insurance Administration, D. 29.04.2011
Preamble: Considering the possibility of the Government Insurance Fund incurring a huge amount of risk under the Government Insurance Fund (Directorate of Insurance) and incurring a huge amount of insurance loss, the Government Insurance Fund, vide Government Decision dated 29.04.2011, is required to bear the maximum liability limit of Rs. 50.00 crore and the remaining was to be divided among the insured/ reinsured. However, considering the huge growth in the insurance business in the past few years and the limited risk appetite of the public sector insurance companies, it was considered to increase the insurance risk liability limit of the Directorate General of Insurance.
Government's decision:
Considering the co-insurance/ re-insurance method of dividing the risk in the insurance sector, the maximum liability limit of the Directorate General of Insurance (GIF) under each type of insurance policy will be increased from Rs. 500,00,00, 000/-) is being done as follows:
(1) It shall be the responsibility of the Directorate General of Insurance to decide, on a case-by-case basis, the amount of liability to be admitted in the insurance policy, taking into account the nature, complexity, consequences, frequency of insurance claims and experience in the insurance sector.
(2) The liability limit of the Directorate General of Insurance shall be reviewed every three years and if there is any excess loss due to the increased liability limit, it shall be reconsidered.
(2) This Government Decision is based on the Informal Reference No. 1 of the Department of Finance. 188/2022/ Expenditure-7, Sec. being issued as per the approval given on 26.04.2022.
