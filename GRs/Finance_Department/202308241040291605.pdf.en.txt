However, with the exception of numbers 3 to 11 in the above' Vacha', guidelines have not been issued in this regard from the government level. Similarly, a long period has elapsed since the enactment of the aforesaid Acts and Rules, which form the mainstay of audit activities.
In this background, the Government was contemplating to take measures to improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the functioning of the Directorate of Local Fund Audit and the Subordinate Regional Offices by bringing uniformity in their functioning through coordination, harmonization and rationalization.

In this background, it will be mandatory for the designated finalizing officers to read each paragraph carefully and ensure that the paragraph is well-articulated, accurate, objective, authoritative, clear, and the conclusion-feedback is coherent.
