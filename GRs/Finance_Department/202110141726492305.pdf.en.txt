Refer to:- 1) Department of Finance, Government Circular No. Finance-2021/ Q. 48/ Finance-3, dated 6th April, 2021.

3) Department of Finance, Government Resolution No. 2021/ Q. 48/ Finance-3, dated July 29, 2021.
The Proposal:
In view of the expected revenue shortfall in the State's tax and non-tax revenues during the financial year 2021-22 due to the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the State's financial system, the above-mentioned dates i.e. 24th June, 2021 and 31st June, 2021 have been revised upwards. In pursuance of the Government decision dated 29th July, 2021 to take fiscal measures, all the Administrative Departments were advised to plan so that 60% of the budgetary provision for the entire year 2021-2022 would be available for expenditure under mandatory and programme expenditure, except for the provision under the target for committed expenditure on salary/ pension/ interest payments/ repayment of loans. However, the demand for increased fund disbursement in the mandatory expenditure for committed expenditure is coming from all the concerned administrative departments in a big way. These include salary, pension, telephone, electricity and water bills, office expenses, rent and taxes, computer expenses, food expenses, petrol, oil and lubricants, other contractual services, etc. The following decisions are now being made.
Government Decision: Keeping in view the background of the contagious disease of COVID-19 in the state and the revenue collection to the state, now the limit of fund disbursement/ expenditure of mandatory expenditure for the first 9 months of the financial year 2021-22 (upto December, 2021) is being fixed at 75%. However, the approval of the Finance Department will be required for 21 items of supply and material, 26 items of advertisement and publicity, 31 items of ancillary grants (non-salaried), 32 items of assistance and 33 items of financial assistance. Funding is also being provided for 50% of the project cost. However, the year-end limit of the program cost will remain at 60%.
Thus, all the concerned administrative departments should plan the expenditure. Apart from the said limit of fund disbursement, the instructions on other matters will remain as on 24th June, 2021 and shall be strictly followed by all the administrative departments.
100% funds are being allocated for MLA Local Area Development Programme and District Annual Plan.
(3) The Department shall disburse the funds at its level, if all the items are being met as per the instructions in this circular and the checklist mentioned in the accompanying Annexure, before drawing the funds available or to be received on the Budget Estimates Distribution and Control System as above from the Treasury. Also, while sending such approval proposals to the Finance Department, the proposals should be sent to the Finance Department for approval with appropriate reasons, clearly stating the terms and conditions on which relaxation is required.

All the above measures should be strictly followed till further orders.
