Maharashtra Treasury Manual, Volume I, Paragraph No. 589 and 601.

As per Rule 495 of the Maharashtra Treasury Rules, 1968, it has been prescribed that the individual deposit accounts (PDA) in which no transaction has taken place for more than one full accounting year should be closed and the amount remaining in such accounts at the end of March every year should be deposited with the government. It is mandatory for every Administrator to tally the amounts deposited or spent in the personal deposit accounts with the records of deposits and expenditure in the respective Sub-Treasury Offices and District Treasury Offices or the Accounts and Grants Office, Mumbai, as the case may be, every month. However, with many administrators not completing the reconciliation process on time, there has been a long-standing difference in the balance in some personal deposit accounts. Due to this difference, there is a problem in closing such personal deposit accounts even if they are not in use.
Records for the period must be available with the Admiralty and Accounts Office, Mumbai and the Administrator concerned in the case of Greater Mumbai and the Administrator and District Treasury Office concerned elsewhere and the Administrator, Sub-Treasury Office and the District Treasury Office concerned in the case of Sub-Treasury to reconcile the personal deposit accounts and to determine the difference. However, it has been observed that most of the records during the period of manual process are no longer available in the office or have been destroyed in some of the offices as the stipulated period of custody of such records has been completed.
iii. In pursuance of the finalization of the Appropriation Accounts and Financial Accounts of the Government for the financial year 2022-23. No financial transactions for a period of more than one year were discussed in the meeting held on 7th July, 2023 at the Accountant General's Office, Mumbai.

Government Resolution No. 2023/ P. No. 89/ Koshaprasad-5
The Accountant General has instructed to give strict instructions to the concerned regarding the closure of personal deposit accounts. Further, the draft report of the Annual Review of the working of the Treasuries, Accounts and Accounts Office, Mumbai, Regional Joint Director, Accounts and Treasuries Offices and the Directorate of Accounts and Treasuries, submitted jointly by the Accountant General, Maharashtra-1& 2, for the financial year 2021-22, has also raised objections to the non-closure of individual deposit accounts where no financial transaction has taken place for more than one year.
(iv) There is a clear provision in the rules that individual deposit accounts where no financial transaction has taken place for more than one year should be closed, but due to non-compliance, the amount of government money gets stuck in such accounts without any reason. This money cannot be used elsewhere. Also, unnecessary correspondence is imposed on the treasury system and the accountant general and their time is wasted.
Considering all the above, it was under the consideration of the Government to take measures to ensure compliance of financial discipline at every stage while dealing with personal deposit accounts. The government has taken the following decisions:
Government's decision
In accordance with the above subject, the administrative departments of the Ministry, all the administrators of personal deposit accounts under them, the Subordinate and Accounts Office, Mumbai, District Treasury Offices, Sub-Treasury Offices will have to strictly comply with the rules prevailing in connection with the transactions of personal deposit accounts and the guidelines issued by the Government from time to time.
As per the decision of the Government in Table No.5 above, the provisions regarding one year time limit prescribed under Rule 495 of the Maharashtra Treasury Rules, 1968, for the purpose of disbursement of land acquisition compensation to the land holders during the acquisition of land for various projects, the personal deposit accounts in the name of the Deputy Divisional Officer and Special Land Acquisition Officer of the Revenue and Forest Department have been excluded. In the future. Appropriate action should be taken in respect of such personal deposit accounts, taking into account the provisions of the aforesaid Government Decision dated 19.6.2023.
3.j Of the personal deposit accounts maintained at the level of the Treasury Office. As on 31.03.2023, the individual deposit accounts in which no financial transaction has taken place for more than one full financial year and the last balance in the records of the District Treasury Office and the Accountant General's Office in respect of such accounts will match, however, if there is a difference in the last balance in the records with the Administrator, such difference will be Rs. The concerned Administrator shall submit a proposal to the Accountant General through the concerned District Treasury Office for closure of the individual deposit accounts which are lying unutilized for more than one financial year, considering the balance in the District Treasury Office as receivable, if the limit is within Rs.50,000/-. To be submitted before October 15, 2023.

4. The personal deposit accounts maintained at the level of Sub-Treasury Office. As on 31.03.2023, the individual deposit accounts in which no financial transaction has taken place for more than one full financial year and the last balance in the records of the Sub-Treasury Office, District Treasury Office and Accountant General Office in respect of such accounts will be matched, however, if there is a difference in the last balance in the records with the Administrator, such difference will be Rs. The concerned Administrator shall submit a proposal to the Accountant General through the concerned Sub-Treasury Office and District Treasury Office to close the individual deposit accounts which are lying unutilized for more than one full financial year by treating the balance in the Sub-Treasury Office as receivable, if it is within the limit of Rs.25,000/-. To be submitted before October 15, 2023.
5. D. Out of the personal deposit accounts at the level of Subordinate and Accounts Office, Mumbai. The accounts as on 31.03.2023, in which no financial transaction has taken place for more than one financial year and the last balance in the records of the Pay and Accounts Office and the Reserve Bank of India in respect of such accounts match, however, if there is a difference in the last balance in the records with the Administrator, such difference shall be Rs. The proposal for closure of unutilized personal deposit accounts for a period not exceeding one full financial year, if the balance with the Reserve Bank of India is within the limit of Rs.50,000/- should be submitted by the Administrator concerned to the Accounts and Accounts Office, Mumbai and the Accounts and Accounts Officer, Mumbai shall take action for closure of such accounts. It should be completed by October 15, 2023.
The Administrator shall be personally liable to deposit the cheque books in respect of such accounts immediately with the concerned Deputy Treasury Officer, District Treasury Officer or the Accounts and Accounts Officer, Mumbai, after completing the process of closure of the individual deposit accounts lying unutilized for more than one financial year in accordance with the provisions of the said paragraphs (3), (4) and (5). The concerned administrator should ensure that there is no delay in this. The cheque books in respect of the closed personal deposit accounts shall be returned by the respective Administrator, who shall also be supervised by the concerned Deputy Treasury Officer, District Treasury Officer or the Accounts and Accounts Officer, Mumbai.
The last balance of the personal deposit accounts lying unutilized for a period exceeding one financial year, which shall be closed with the approval of the Accountant General in accordance with the directions in paragraphs 3 and 4 above and with the approval of the Accounting and Accounts Officer, Mumbai, in accordance with the directions in paragraph 5 above, shall be deposited in the Government Accounts under the credit head 0075 COMPREHENSIVE GENERAL SERVICES, 00, 101, UNDER REQUEST DEPOSIT (00) (00) (01) UNDER REQUEST DEPOSIT 00750011.
8. It has been repeatedly pointed out that while there is a clear provision in the extant rules regarding closure of individual deposit accounts where no financial transaction has taken place for a period exceeding one financial year and the action is expected to be proposed suo motu by the Administrator concerned, in reality there is an inexcusable lapse at the level of the Administrator. This is a violation of fiscal discipline.
In this regard, the existing rules are being strictly followed by our subordinates.

The responsibility of ensuring this will be of the controlling officers of the concerned administrators, the heads of the departments at the state level and the administrative departments of the ministry. It will be mandatory for the concerned Controlling Authorities, State Level Heads of Departments and Administrative Departments of the Ministry to ensure proper control through internal audit and administrative oversight etc.
The Administrator may direct the Sub-Treasury Office, District Treasury Office or the Accounts and Accounts Office, Mumbai, as the case may be, to close the individual deposit accounts where no financial transaction has taken place for a period exceeding one financial year. If the proposal is not received by 15.09.2023, the concerned Sub-Treasury Office, District Treasury Office or Cess and Accounts Office, Mumbai shall instruct such Administrator to take immediate action in this regard. And then two weeks later. If no response is received from the concerned Administrator by 30.9.2023, the Office of the Accountant General may be asked to close the individual deposit accounts which are lying unutilized for more than one financial year, if such individual deposit accounts meet the criteria in the said paragraphs 4, 5 and 6. The District Treasury Officer shall have full powers to submit the proposal by 15.10.2023 and the Accounts and Accounts Officer, Mumbai shall have full powers to take a final decision to close such accounts in respect of offices in Mumbai.
10.After the closure of an individual deposit account where there has been no financial transaction for more than one financial year, the accounts cannot be mutually revived at the sectoral level.
For this, the concerned administrator should take appropriate action regarding the submission of a complete proposal regarding the opening of a new personal deposit account to the Finance Department through the administrative department of the concerned ministry.
11.If the purpose of personal deposit account is terminated before the completion of one year, the concerned Administrator may request the office of Accounts and Accounts, Mumbai or District Treasury Office or Sub-Treasury Office, as the case may be, for closure of such personal deposit account. If such a proposal is received, the District Treasury Office or the Sub-Treasury Office should submit a proposal to the Accountant General's Office to close the accounts within two weeks. Further, in case of offices located in Mumbai, the Accounts and Accounts Office, Mumbai shall take a decision to close the said personal deposit account within two weeks.
12. Deposits in respect of patient fees under the Public Health Department were deposited in the Personal Deposit Accounts. The Accountant General's office had objected to the deposit being made in personal deposit accounts instead of depositing the accumulated amounts in the consolidated fund. Accordingly, instructions have already been issued regarding deposit of patient fee under Public Health Department in the head 0210. Offices under the public health department deposit the said amount in the government accounts through the GRAS system. In view of the above, there appears to be no purpose in continuing the personal deposit accounts in respect of patient fees under the Public Health Department. Therefore, the concerned Administrators and Treasuries should take immediate action to close such personal deposit accounts. This must be done before 15.10.2023.
Since the scholarship amount is directly credited to the student's account through DBT, the purpose of continuing the personal deposit accounts related to the scholarship alone has also been done away with. But there is a lack of

However, the proposal to close these accounts has not been sent to the Accountant General's office.
Finally, the proposal to close the accounts by the concerned administrators by going to the district treasury and reconciling immediately. Due care should be taken to ensure that the Treasury Office concerned is able to send the report to the Accountant General's Office before 15.10.2023. After taking action against the concerned responsible for the non-conformity, the amount remaining in the said account should be deposited in the government accounts under the head of 0075 Narrow General Service, 00, 101, Unclaimed Deposits (00) (00) (01) Unclaimed Deposits 00750011 in consultation with the Accountant General's Office.
In future also, in case of individual deposit accounts where no transaction has taken place for more than one full financial year, as per the provision prescribed under Rule 495 of the Maharashtra Treasury Rules, 1968, a proposal for closure of such unused individual deposit accounts shall be sent to the Accountant General's Office in the next nearest month immediately after the end of the financial year. Further, in the case of Mumbai, the process of closing such unutilized personal deposit accounts with reconciliation in the nearest month after the end of the financial year will be carried out by the Accounts and Accounts Officer, Mumbai.
15.Additional Assistant Accounts and Accounts Officer at the Grants and Accounts Office, Mumbai and an Additional Treasury Officer (Deposit/ Computer) at the District Treasury Office level will act as coordinators in this regard. The weekly review of the action taken will be done by the District Treasury Officer and the Accounts and Accounts Officer, Mumbai. The Coordinating Officer will also guide the concerned office regarding the reconciliation of personal deposit accounts.
One of the most important responsibilities entrusted to the Treasury Officers is to tally the balance of the personal deposit accounts in the Treasury Accounts with the balance recorded in the books of the Administrators and with the balance recorded in the books of the Accountants General. Similarly, it is also the basic and primary duty of the concerned administrator to synchronize his designated personal deposit accounts with the treasury accounts. As the District Treasury Officer acts as an important link between the Accountant General's office and the Administrator, the role of the District Treasury Officer is very important in the process of reconciling the personal deposit accounts.
17.The Administrator concerned should take care to reconcile the personal deposit accounts from time to time as a precaution to avoid misuse of public money. The concerned Deputy Treasury Officer/ District Treasury Officer or the Accounts and Accounts Officer, Mumbai shall also take due care to ensure that the reconciliation proceedings are regularly completed by the Administrator of the individual deposit accounts to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the accounts in respect of the individual deposit accounts.
18.Following the provisions prescribed under paragraph No. 589 of Chapter IX of the Maharashtra Treasury Manual, Volume I, the District Treasury Officers shall, for the purpose of determining the balance in respect of all individual deposit accounts which have been duly reconciled with the figures in the Treasury at the end of every financial year, take care to inform the Accountant General's Office without fail in the month of April every year.
