Refer to:- 1) Department of Finance, Government Circular No.Finance-2021/ Q. 48/ R.T.-3.D. dated 6th April, 2021.

The Proposal:
Considering the expected shortfall in the State's tax and non-tax revenue in the financial year 2021-22 due to the outbreak of COVID-19 and its impact on the State's finances, all the Administrative Departments may plan to provide 60% of the budgetary provision for the entire year 2021-2022 under the Compulsory and Programme Expenditure, except for the provisions under the Obligatory Expenditure Objective of Salary/ Pension/ Interest Payments/ Repayment of Loan in pursuance of the financial measures to be taken by the Government under the above decision dated 24th June, 2021. However, in view of the perception being expressed by some administrative departments that the expenditure limit of budgetary provision is 60% till the end of half year September, 2021, the following clarification is being issued in this regard.
Government's decision:
In view of the above decision of the Government dated 24th June, 2021 and the situation of revenue deficit in the State, it is hereby clarified that all the administrative departments should plan expenditure in such a way that the limit of fund disbursement/ expenditure till the end of this year for the programme expenditure, including the mandatory expenditure, remains at 60%. These are to be strictly adhered to by all the departments as there will be no increase in these limits due to the difficult economic situation arising out of the Covid-19 pandemic.
