GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: PARIKH 2022/ PR No.84/ KHASA-5
Madam Cama Marg, Hutatma Rajguru Chowk,
Mantralaya, Mumbai- 400 032
Date: 19th of June 2023
Reference: Department of Finance, Government Resolution No. Narrow 1014/ No.5/ Koshasra 5D. January 24, 2014.
The Proposal:
Rule 495 of the Maharashtra Treasury Rules, 1968, provides for closure of Personal Deposit Account (PLA) accounts in which no transaction has taken place for more than one full accounting year and the amount remaining in such accounts at the end of March every year shall be credited to the government.
Personal Deposit Accounts in the name of Sub Divisional Officers and Special Land Acquisition Officers have been created for the purpose of disbursing land acquisition compensation to land holders while acquiring land for various projects. However, in some cases where disputes arise, the amount of land acquisition benefit is not disbursed to the land owners immediately as such cases are adjudicated. The amount will remain in the personal deposit account till the court orders. The said amount is meant to be distributed to the land owners as per the adjudication within the prescribed period after the order of the court. However, the Maharashtra Treasury Rules No. Section 495 of the Act makes it mandatory to close accounts that have not been transacted for a full accounting year. As a result, the land owners could not be allotted the land within the stipulated period after the court order. In such a situation, in the next financial year, the amount has to be withdrawn from the treasury by making budgetary provisions again, and the personal deposit account has to be revived and deposited in it. This process is time consuming. Non-compliance of court orders often leads to confiscation of government property. In order to address these difficulties, the Personal Deposit Accounts in the name of the Sub Divisional Officer, as well as the Special Land Acquisition Officer, are required to be registered under Rule No. 1 of the Maharashtra Treasury Rules, 1968. The issue of exemption from the provisions prescribed under Section 495 was under the consideration of the government.
