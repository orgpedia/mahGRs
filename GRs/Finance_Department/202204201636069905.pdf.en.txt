Introduction: Dated from 1/1/2016 to d. The cases of retirement of the employees who retired from the service of the State Government during the period 31/12/2018 are submitted to the Accountant General's Office after verifying the salary fixation as per the provisions of the 7th Pay Commission. Considering the administrative urgency to clear the backlog in the process of wage verification due to delay in checking of service books of the employees who retired during the said period due to inadequate staff strength in the Pay Scrutiny Team and shortage of supporting officers/ staff for the said work, it was approved under the Government Resolution dated 25.05.2021 in Reference No.2 as" a special case" to engage 5 additional retired officers/ staff on contractual basis for a period of 11 months. In this regard, the Directorate of Accounts and Treasuries has decided to consider the number of pending service books for the early disposal of salary fixation cases as there is shortage of staff. Reference No. 3 has requested for extension of service of 4 additional officers/ staff appointed as per Government decision dated 25.05.2021 beyond 7.06.2022. The government has taken the following decisions:
