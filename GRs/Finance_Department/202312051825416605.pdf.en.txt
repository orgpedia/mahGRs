The Department-wise chart of receipt of funds from the Central Government in respect of Centrally Sponsored Schemes in the Consolidated Fund is sent by the Finance Office of the Finance Department to the email of the Additional Chief Secretary/ Principal Secretary/ Secretary of all the concerned departments every Friday. The circular dated 18th May, 2020 has directed that after receiving the e-mail regarding the deposit of funds in the Consolidated Fund of the State, the Heads of Departments of the concerned departments of the Central Government should verify the orders of the Central Government regarding the funds received for the said schemes and for this there is no need to refer the funds separately to the Finance Department.
In Part VIII of the Scheme for Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment, 2023-24, it is provided that if the State disburses the Central and State share of funds of more than 95% of the Centrally Sponsored Schemes to the concerned SNAs within the period (30 days) prescribed by the Central Government under its Order dated 16.02.2023, the State will be sanctioned an incentive of Rs. As per the instructions issued by the Ministry of Finance, dated 16.02.2023, in pursuance of the procedure for disbursement of funds under Centrally Sponsored Schemes, the Administrator, Shri. After 1st April, 2023, the State Government shall transfer the amount of Central share and balance State share to the SNA within thirty days from the date of disbursement of Central share under the Centrally Sponsored Scheme. The interest amount will have to be deposited in the central government's consolidated fund.
Despite the Finance Department informing the department every week about the receipt of central funds, it is observed that the amount of the central account and the balance state share are not being transferred to the SNA account by many departments within the stipulated time. In the above circumstances, it should be possible to disburse the funds of Centrally Sponsored Schemes within the stipulated time frame, without any interest burden on the State Governments and special incentives to the States under the Scheme of Assistance to States for Capital Investment 2023-2024.
