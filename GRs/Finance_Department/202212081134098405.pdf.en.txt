the prelude
The Transfers Act, 2005 has been enacted to regulate transfers of Government servants and to prevent delay in discharge of official duties. As per the provisions of the second proviso to section 6 of the said Act, the powers of transfer of employees of the cadre of Inspector of State Taxes under serial number 3 above' Vacha' in the office of Goods and Services Tax, under the Finance Department, shall be vested in the Government. Minister of State (Finance) The Minister (Finance) has delegated the Special Commissioner of Sales Tax, State of Maharashtra, Mumbai. Considering the sanctioned strength of the cadre of State Tax Inspectors, a large number of transfers are expected in the cadre of State Tax Inspectors.
It is not possible to make such a large number of transfers from one office. There are five zones in the GST zone- Thane, Nashik, Pune, Kolhapur and Nagpur. Therefore, as it is convenient to make the scheduled transfers of the State Tax Inspectors according to the areas, the proposal to return some of the powers of the transfers of the employees of the State Tax Inspector Cadre in the Goods and Services Tax Office was under the consideration of the Government.
GOVERNMENT DECISIONS In order to regulate transfers of Government servants and to prevent delay in discharge of official duties, the following powers are being delegated to the officers mentioned in column 4 of the table below, in accordance with the second proviso to section 6 and section 7 of the Transfers Act, 2005, in the cadre of State Tax Inspector in the Goods and Services Tax Office under the Finance Department:
