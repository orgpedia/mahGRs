Introduction: The insurance business is charged 9% CGST and 9% SGST of the premium. The amount of goods and services received by the Directorate General of Insurance along with the insurance premium is provided to the Central Excise Department from the sub-heading of revenue expenditure. Considering the fact that the payment of goods and services tax could be made within the stipulated time and that the expenditure should not be included in the revenue expenditure, the matter was under consideration for opening a new head of account.
Government Decision:- The Insurance Directorate is being approved to open a new head of account for providing the amount of goods and services received along with the insurance premium as follows:
