Circular:
The Supplementary Statement of Expenditure for the current financial year under Article 205 of the Constitution of India will be presented in the March, 2022 session of the Legislature as usual. In view of the provisions of the Constitution as well as the Maharashtra Budget Rule Book, the Supplementary Statement of Demands/ Expenditure in respect of the matter mentioned below is submitted to the Legislature.
(a) matters in respect of which no supplementary demands or appropriations have so far been submitted to the Legislature in respect of the amounts sanctioned or to be made out of the Contingency Fund.
(b) only such matters as may be prescribed by order of the Court and the expenditure in the form of loads and the expenditure on new matters which may be planned to be incurred after obtaining approval from the Legislature by way of a supplementary demand.
(a) Typical demands relating to bringing the expenditure on new works to the notice of the Legislature.
Since March 2021, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the State has been on the rise again. As it is adversely affecting the state's economy by causing a huge fall in tax and non-tax revenue, the date of disbursement of funds as per the requirement for the committed expenditure targets for the financial year 2021-22 has been fixed. Beams have been introduced into the system through a Government Circular dated 03rd February, 2022. In view of the Covid situation in the current financial year, there is a need to prioritize expenditure and take measures accordingly to keep the state's finances under control while limiting the government's bound expenditure. Therefore, in such a situation, it has become imperative for the departments to submit supplementary demand proposals only for the following purposes.
(1) Requests for supplies not yet submitted to the Legislature in respect of amounts sanctioned or to be made out of the Contingency Fund.
