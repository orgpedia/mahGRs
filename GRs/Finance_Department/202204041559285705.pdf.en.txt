After the completion and determination of the supplier, as well as following the conditions in this guideline, the purchase payments should be drawn from the treasury. Cheques for purchase should be issued in the name of the supplier concerned and paid through Electronic Clearance System (ECS).
Short payment:- Many a time, funds are spent by the departments through short payment. However, non-submission of its detailed payment may lead to accounting objections and possible default. However, henceforth, the departments should not draw funds under the head of accounts without the consent of the Finance Department unless they submit the head under which the old detailed payments are pending.
16. Unexpired Amount: Departments should note that funds lying unutilized for various reasons are technically shown as spent by the departments by transferring them to their subordinate corporation. Provisions shall not be drawn or disbursed unless the previous unspent funds (held outside the purview of the self-financing account/ corporation account or otherwise showing expenditure) under them have been fully spent. It is also pointed out that a large amount of funds are found to be lying with the departments under their own provident accounts. If the funds are not spent within the stipulated time, they should be returned to the government. If the unaccounted money is kept in the bank, its bank account statement should be submitted to the government.
17. Before drawing the funds available on the Budget Estimates, Allocations and Control System as above, the Department shall disburse the funds at their level if all the items are being reimbursed as per the checklist mentioned in this circular as well as the items mentioned in the Annexure, otherwise such proposal will have to be approved by the Expenditure Branch and Budget Branch of the Finance Department with the approval of the Planning Department/ Social Justice and Special Assistance Department/ Tribal Development Department, where necessary. Also, while sending such approval proposals to the Finance Department, the proposals should be sent to the Finance Department for approval with suitable reasons, clearly stating the terms and conditions on which relaxation is required.
18. It is observed that except for the expenditure on salaries, the expenditure on other items is not proportionate during the financial year. Despite the availability of funds, it cannot be spent due to lack of process. As a result, most of the provisions remain unutilized throughout the year and are spent towards the end of the financial year without adequate preparation. Every year, a large amount of budgetary allocations are seen to be spent in the last month of the financial year. Due to all these things, financial discipline is not being followed. No development works take place. Therefore, the administrative departments should plan the expenditure for 2022-23 properly. The administrative departments should review this every 3 months at the level of administrative department heads and ensure that there is no rush of expenditure in the last month of the year and give such instructions to the controlling authorities. If there is any financial irregularity in this regard, the administrative department will be responsible.
In addition to the above terms and conditions, the departments are advised that it shall be the responsibility of the departments to comply with the provisions of the State Government's Working Manual, Financial Manual, Budget Rule Book and all the terms and conditions while making the expenditure.
