Therefore, the Drawing and Disbursing Officer as well as the officers/ staff of the Treasury Office who audit the payments should follow the following instructions.
a) Procedure to be followed by the Drawing and Disbursing Officer:
All the instructions mentioned in the Government Resolution dated 22nd January, 2013 should be strictly followed.
All the Drawing and Disbursing Officers are required to register the requester, supplier, contractor or third person in the' Beams' system through the' Add New Payee' option and submit the printed application form through the system to the Treasury Office along with the appropriate documents.
Payees should be selected from the' Payee Details' on the Beams/ Beel portal system and submit the payments to the Treasury Office with the letter of authorization. Special care needs to be taken while selecting' Payee'. Because in the Beams/ Beel portal system, as soon as the initials of the name of the payee are entered, all the payees starting with that letter appear on the system. If the first word in the name of the addressee is the same, the possibility of the addressee being chosen incorrectly cannot be ruled out. Thus, even in the absence of a malfunction, the wrong payer can be chosen in a hurry or due to negligence. Therefore, the Drawing and Disbursing Officer should ensure the correct selection of the income on the Beams/ Beel portal system.
After the payment is passed as per the procedure prevailing in the Treasury Office, the information of the concerned payment will be' Uploaded' to the' CMP' portal by the Treasury Office and the concerned will be given' CMP Advice Slip'. On the CMP system, the Drawing and Disbursing Officer must verify the details of the payee once again before approving the payee's contribution.
5 Since the Treasury Office does not have the facility and authority to change the Beams Authorization Letter, the Drawing and Disbursing Officer will be fully responsible for the payment of the amount to the wrong person.
b) Care to be taken while providing CMP by Treasury Offices:
The Treasury Office shall verify the names of the payee on the authorization letter along with the details of the supplier/ requester/ third party on the sub-certificate received along with the payment while auditing the payment. If there is any discrepancy between the two names, the payments should be objected and asked to the Drawing and Disbursing Officer. The treasury office should also take care that under no circumstances the wrong amount is provided to the recipient.
2. A printed application for registration of a new payee from the Drawing and Disbursing Officer is received through the system at the Treasury Office for approval along with appropriate documents. on the cancelled cheque presented by the Drawing and Disbursing Officer to the Treasury while approving such proposals on the system.
