7. Controlling Authorities to make available the grants received through Supplementary Demand on BEAMS system expeditiously:
After the government approves the grants to various departments as per the eighth revised budget and through supplementary demands, the administrative departments and department heads provide the grants to the late drawing and disbursing officers on the BEAMS system. Then there is a delay in processing the payments, submission to the sub-treasury, etc. So the. On 31st March, the BEAMS system and the Treasury Net system come under severe stress and these systems get shut down or disrupted. For this, all the departments/ controlling authorities should ensure that the grants received through revised budget and supplementary demand should be made available on BEAMS immediately.
