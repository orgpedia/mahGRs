Madam Cama Marg, Hutatma Rajguru Chowk,
Ministry, Mumbai- 400 032.
Date: 14th of June 2021.
Refer to:- 1) Finance Department Government Circular No. 2021/ No. 48/ Finance-3, No. April 6, 2021.
Circular: Supplementary Statement of Expenditure for the current financial year under Article 205 of the Constitution of India will be presented as usual in the July, 2021 session of the Legislature. In view of the provisions of the Constitution as well as the Maharashtra Budget Rule Book, the Supplementary Statement of Demands/ Expenditure in respect of the matters mentioned below is submitted to the Legislature.
(a) matters in respect of which supplementary demands or appropriations have not yet been submitted to the Legislature in respect of amounts sanctioned or to be made out of the Contingency Fund.
(b) only such matters as may be prescribed by order of the Court and the expenditure in the form of loads and the expenditure on new matters which may be planned to be incurred after the approval of the Legislature by way of a supplementary demand.
(a) Typical demands relating to bringing the expenditure on new works to the notice of the Legislature.
Since March 2021, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the State has been on the rise again. As it is adversely affecting the State's economy by causing a huge fall in the State's tax and non-tax revenue, a limited amount of funds has been allocated to the BEAMS system through a Government Circular dated 6th April, 2021 for the fiscal year 2021-22 with very urgent and binding expenditure targets. In view of the Covid situation in the current financial year, there is a need to prioritize expenditure and take measures accordingly to keep the state's finances under control while limiting the government's committed expenditure. Therefore, in such a situation, it has become imperative for the departments to submit supplementary demand proposals only for the following purposes.
(i) the demand for supplies/ appropriations not yet submitted to the Legislature in respect of the amounts sanctioned or to be released from the Contingency Fund; (ii) for the Central and State share of Central/ Externally Aided/ Centrally Sponsored Schemes for which no provision has been made in the Budget or more than 50% of the provision has been made and where funds are required,

(3) In respect of expenditure for which no provision has been made in the budget in the prescribed manner, (4) in respect of matters for which more than 75% of the budgetary provisions have been spent and for which further provision is required,
In view of the above, all the Ministries/ Departments are required to send all the Supplementary Demands for Compulsory and Programme Expenditure in respect of the above mentioned items along with the proposal in Annexure-A and the information in Annexure-B, C and D depending upon the procedure, to the Department of Finance for registration in the first instance.
In this regard, the schedule for forwarding the proposals regarding the supplementary demand for programme and mandatory expenditure to be included in the July, 2021 session to the Planning (Development Area Office)/ Social Justice and Special Assistance/ Tribal Development Department and Finance Department is given separately as follows. Since the registration of supplementary demand proposals will be done online on the BEAMS system, it is imperative that all the concerned departments take action as per the prescribed schedule.
