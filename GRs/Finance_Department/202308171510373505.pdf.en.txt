As did Ma. The Supreme Court has given the verdict. Therefore, it is necessary to make timely payments. Also Ma. Since it is necessary to issue instructions on the lines of the Central Government after taking into consideration the recommendations made by the Lok Ayukta, the State Government employees have a legal opinion on the excesses committed during their service.
In view of this, the following circular is being issued by the government.
The government circular is in line with the exemption from recovery of excess payment to state government employees during their service. 3480/2020 filed in the High Court, Aurangabad Bench. The High Court. Orders issued on 15.09.2021.
Paragraphs 9 and 10 of the said order of the Hon'ble High Court are as follows:
"9. Before Parting with this matter, we deem it appropriate to record that we are coming across such cases practically everyday. Most of the cases are in connection with the various zilla parishads and State instrumentalities. In most of the cases, there is no undertaking executed by the beneficiary. We cannot ignore the fact that in such cases, the employee, though disentitled, has pocketed the tax payers amount.
10. We, therefore, deem it appropriate to direct the Chief Secretary of the State of Maharashtra to issue appropriate directions to all the departments of the State Government and local authorities/bodies, to mandate executing of undertakings from employees, who would be beneficiaries of pay fixation or calculations of increments or any similar calculations with regard to monetary benefits. It shall be stated that in such undertakings that they would refund excess amounts if subsequently found to have been paid in excess. This would be in the interest of the State Exchequer and would also control excess payments which cannot be recovered subsequently. The Chief Secretary shall consider the judgement delivered by the Hon'ble Apex Court in Jagdev Singh ( Supra), wherein the Hon'ble Apex Court has concluded that if an undertaking is executed by such a beneficiary at the time of receiving monetary benefits, he would be liable to repay the said amount to the employer.
2. Public money is the money collected from the taxpayers. In order to ensure that taxpayers' money is not wasted in any way, it is necessary to curb the amount of overpayment that cannot be recovered in the future.
Considering this. In accordance with the above order, the High Court Based on the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Mr. Jagdev Singh

" Before providing any amount to the beneficiaries, it is ordered to take an undertaking in writing that in case it is found in future that any excess payment has been made by the government to the beneficiary, the beneficiary will be bound to return the amount to the government," the order said. Accordingly, the Department of Finance has issued a Government Circular No: 2021/ No.52/ Service-3, D. Issued on 22.11.2021.
3. Ma. Considering the recommendations of the Commissioner. Circular issued on 07.10.2022. The circular No. 1 to 5 should be strictly implemented. Also, in the circular, the Central Government in Notice No. 6. In line with the instructions dated 02.03.2016, the following suggestions are being incorporated.
In Civil Appeal No. 11527/ 2014 (arising out of Special Leave Petition (C) No. 11684/2012) (State of Punjab and Others Vs. Rafiq Masih, White Washer, Others), the Hon'ble The following is paragraph 12 of the final judgment dated 18.12.2014 delivered by the Supreme Court, New Delhi.
12. It is not possible to postulate all situations of hardship, which would govern employees on the issue of recovery, where payments have mistakenly been made by the employer, in excess of their entitlement. Be that as it may, based on the decisions referred to herein above, we may, as a ready reference, summaries the following few situations, wherein recoveries by the employers, would be impermissible in law: (i) Recovery from employees belonging to Class-III and Class-IV service (or Group 'C' and Group 'D' service).
(ii) Recovery from retired employees, or employees who are due to retire within one year, of the order of recovery.
(iii) Recovery from employees, when the excess payment has been made for a period in excess of five years, before the order of recovery is issued.
(iv) Recovery in cases where an employee has wrongfully been required to discharge duties of a higher post, and has been paid accordingly, even though he should have rightfully been required to work against an inferior post.
(v) In any other case, where the Court arrives at the conclusion, that recovery if made from the employee, would be iniquitous or harsh or arbitrary to such an extent, as would far outweigh the equitable balance of the employer's right to recover.
