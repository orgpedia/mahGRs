Introduction: Under the e-Courts project, the Central Government has taken up the programme of computerization of District Courts and Subordinate Courts. Accordingly, a tripartite MoU has been signed between the Central Government, State Government and High Court under the e-Courts Mission Mode Project.
The MoU lays down the role and responsibilities of the State Government.
The issue No. As per Section 5, the state government has to provide funds for recurring expenditure on fuel and other expenses of DG sets, providing broadband connectivity to the residences of judicial officers, expenditure on maintenance of hardware, etc.
Under the e-Courts Mission Mode Project (Phase II), the initial recurring cost of Internet connectivity for two years has been borne by the Central Government, after which the recurring cost of Internet connectivity is expected to be borne by the State Government. Accordingly, Ma. High Court, Mumbai has made WAN connectivity available through BSNL in the courts of the state under the e-Courts project. It was submitted to the government by the High Court. Since the recurring cost to be borne by BSNL/ MTNL for reimbursement of the payment received in respect of WAN connectivity is required to be approved, the proposal was submitted to the Finance Department for approval and they have agreed to the recurring cost for WAN connectivity. Accordingly, the matter of approving the recurring expenditure for WAN connectivity was under the consideration of the government.
Government's decision:
The expenditure for WAN connectivity of all District and Sessions Courts, City Civil and Sessions Court, Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Family Courts, Small Causes Court, is being approved through this.
