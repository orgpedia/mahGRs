litigations between two or more Government Departments OR by the Public Sector
Undertaking/s against the State.

Collector reported in 2003 (3) SCC 472, had expressed that there is a need for the State
Government to establish a Committee to resolve controversies that may arise between the Departments of the State or between the State and any of its undertakings. The Hon’ble Supreme Court further observed that it would be appropriate for the State Governments to set
up a Committee consisting of the Chief Secretary of the State, Secretaries of the concerned Departments, Secretary of Law, and, where financial commitments are involved, the
Secretary of Finance. The decisions made by such a Committee shall be binding on all the
concerned Departments and shall represent the stand of the Government.

between two or more State Government Departments, all the Departments involved shall co-
ordinate to ensure that no conflicting views are put forth before the Court. In such cases, the
Department to which the petition/case is mainly related, shall co-ordinate with the other
Department/s and file a consolidated comprehensive affidavit in the matter, stating the stand
