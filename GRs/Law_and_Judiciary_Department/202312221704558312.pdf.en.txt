Preamble: Shri Siddhivinayak Ganapati Mandir Trust has started a 12-bed dialysis centre at Appasaheb Marathe Marg, Prabhadevi. A Dialysis Centre of 8 beds in 3 sessions was also started at Prabodhan, Goregaon in collaboration with Prabodhan, Goregaon Institute. The number of patients is increasing each day. This disease requires long-term treatment. Since dialysis treatment is expensive, most patients give up treatment without undergoing long-term dialysis treatment. After careful consideration, the Trust has decided to implement an ambitious plan to provide dialysis treatment to at least 300 patients per day (in 3 shifts on 100 machines) in Mumbai. Considering the physical condition of the kidney-affected patient, such patients prefer to get treated at the nearest dialysis centre, and therefore, the Trust has decided to implement this scheme in various parts of Mumbai in collaboration with other charitable institutions/ service-oriented organizations etc. The proposal to run the dialysis centre was received from Sharad Narayan Acharya Medical Centre, Chembur, Mumbai, which was set up through the Sufla Trust, and the Shri Siddhivinayak Ganpati Mandir Trust. The proposal will be considered by the Trust Management Committee at its meeting to be held on 6th July, 2023 (Decision No. 1707A) was approved and it was decided that the proposal should be sent to the Government for approval.
11 machines have been installed in the dialysis center set up by Sufla Trust at Sharad Narayan Acharya Medical Center, Chembur, Mumbai and this dialysis center will be run as Shri Siddhivinayak Dialysis Center. Sufla Trust, Chembur, Mumbai is responsible for the day-to-day maintenance, electricity, water and rent of the repair centre.
