According to the old format of the department, 36 posts have been approved in the cadre of Sepoy in Class-4 Group-D, out of which 26 posts are working and 10 posts are vacant. The Sub-Committee has approved the creation of an equivalent number of notional posts in Group-D of the Department of Law and Justice against the existing 10 vacancies in the peon cadre and filling them up through an external agency. The Committee has also suggested to the Department to propose notional posts in lieu of 10 regular posts lying vacant in the peon cadre in the revised pattern.
