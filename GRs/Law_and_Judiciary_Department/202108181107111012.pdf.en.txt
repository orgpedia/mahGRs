The Government of Maharashtra
Department of Law and Justice,
Government Resolution No. Narrow 2016/749/ No. 214/ Work-6
Ministry, Mumbai- 400 032.
Date is August 18, 2021.
Reference: 1. Government Order, Law and Justice Department, No. Composite 2011/ S.No. 167/ Office- 6, dated 20th October, 2011. Rule/ X- 4402/95/44, dated 16th August, 2016.
Letter from the Director (Law& Research) No. Rule/ 2021/135, dated May 06, 2021.
The Proposal:
With the increase in the number of courts in the state and the jurisdiction of the municipal corporations and municipalities, the bailiffs have to use their own vehicles as public transport is not available in time to carry orders and mail.
Also, since most bailiffs live in rural areas, they have to travel to different places to perform their duties. Apart from that bailiffs also have to do the work of Lok Adalat and Gram Adalat. The processing work of the bailiffs has also increased tremendously and the time taken for payment of travel allowance, availability of subsidy, recording of subsidy and submission of payments to the treasury of the Taluk Court, etc., is being wasted in reimbursing the travel allowance payment for the expenses incurred for travel.
Think about this. Bombay High Court Rules Committee As on 24th March, 2021, the permanent travelling allowance of bailiffs is Rs. 1500/- per month has been decided.
In accordance with the above matters and the decision of the Rules Committee, the present reference No. 1 per month to the employees of the Government. The matter of revising the permanent travel allowance of Rs 200/- was under consideration of the Government.
Government's decision:
The Government is approving the implementation of a permanent travel allowance of Rs.1500/- (Rupees One Thousand Five Hundred only) per month to the bailiff employees of the Small Cause Court, Mumbai and Subordinate Courts in the State.
(2) The expenditure shall be met from the grants sanctioned under the head of accounts under which the salary of the employee concerned is drawn.
