The proposal-
The provisions of Section 41A of the Maharashtra Public Trusts Act, 1950 and the rules made thereunder. As per the judgment of the Bombay High Court in Writ Petition No. 3132/2004, for providing free and concessional medical treatment to the poor and weaker sections of the society, the Government of Maharashtra has decided to provide free and concessional medical treatment to the poor and weaker sections of the society. The High Court has made a plan. It is mandatory for every charitable hospital to reserve 10 per cent of the total operational beds in their hospital for free treatment of poor patients and 10 per cent of the beds for treatment of patients belonging to weaker sections at subsidised rates.
It is mandatory to follow the rules and regulations set by the government to take advantage of this discount. Charitable hospitals in the state will get the above-mentioned discounts under this scheme
It is expected to be given to patients from poor and weaker sections. However, the poor and vulnerable

Several complaints have been received regarding non-transparent availability of these concessional beds to the patients
Since hospitals are charitable in nature, they benefit from many government concessions. However, since the hospitals are not effectively implementing the scheme of providing beds reserved for the poor in a transparent manner, the government expects to benefit from it.
The poor and the downtrodden are not being treated.
Different committees have been formed by different departments to make the beds in the charitable hospital available to the poor and weaker sections of the patients. However, availability of reserved beds in charitable hospitals to the poor and weaker sections as per norms, availability of beds reserved for poor and weaker sections in charitable hospitals, availability of beds in the reserved hospitals in real time, availability of beds for treatment of the needy patients in which hospital.
There should be a separate online system for providing information about the availability of treatment facilities, the relatives of the needy patients should be able to easily access the above information and the patient should be able to get timely treatment. Reference No. 1 The decision-making and
Reference No. The committee has been formed on the basis of 2 certificates. The reserved beds in the charitable hospital are immediately available to the poor and weaker section patients in a transparent manner.
