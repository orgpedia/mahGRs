The proposal-
The Finance Department has suggested that in order to ensure adequate funds for development works, without creating new posts, the works should be done by external agencies. As per the Government decision dated 27.4.2022 of the Department of Finance, revised instructions have been issued stating that 20 to 30 percent savings in overall cost is required while carrying out works from external agencies. The matters to be followed for availing services by external agencies for the posts of Class 3 and Class 4 in the courts of the State have been prescribed under the Government Decisions dated 27.1.2015, 23.2.2017 and 9.8.2017 of the Department of Law and Justice. As per the provisions of the said Government Order, services are provided through external agencies in various courts of the State. The services of the manpower required by the courts as per their requirements are taken on contract basis by external agencies. These include security guards, garden workers, peons, cleaners, drivers, data entry operators, etc. The services of security guards are provided by the Maharashtra State Security Corporation under the control of the Home Department. The process of e-tendering of contracts is done at the district court level. While hiring services through external agencies, a Committee of Judges at the level of District Court scrutinizes the procurement tenders and approves the proposal of the Low Rate (L-1) tenderer, M/ s. It is submitted to the government through the High Court, Mumbai.

This process has been going on for several years. However, the Department of Industry, Energy and Labour, vide Government Order dated 14.03.2023, has accorded approval for appointment of a total of 9 service provider agencies/ panels to carry out works by external agencies.
However, since the courts are not part of the government departments, semi-government departments, local self-government institutions, corporations, public sector undertakings and are not under the control of the government and are autonomous, the proposal to deal with the proposal of hiring manpower through external agencies for the courts was submitted for the approval of the government as per the decision of the government of Law and Justice Department. The government has approved the proposal and the decision has been taken accordingly.
