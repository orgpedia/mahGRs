Department of Information Technology Reference No. 02 here. According to the comment on 24.06.2025:
In case of procurement, the department should take a decision at the department level in accordance with the procurement policy of the government.
Instructions have been given. Accordingly, the Project Implementation Committee of the Department was constituted. 26.06.2025

Live Streaming Facility subject to the following recommendations made by the representatives of the Department of Technology:
Action should be taken.
Technical Recommendations for - Virtual Courtroom Live Streaming for Citizens
1. Frame Rate Optimization
For live streaming, the video feed should support up to 30 frames per second (FPS) to ensure a smooth and clear viewing experience for citizens, especially during active court proceedings where lip-sync and gesture recognition are important.
For recorded storage, the feed may be down sampled to 15-20 FPS. This helps optimize storage consumption and reduce recurring costs, without significantly compromising the integrity or review quality of archived footage.
2. Secure Access and Data Transmission
All user access to the platform should be facilitated via HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) to ensure end-to-end encryption. This will protect sensitive judicial content from unauthorized access or tampering.
3. Access Control
Enforce role-based access controls (RBAC) to ensure that only authorized users (e.g., general public, media, legal professionals) can access appropriate content streams, with varying levels of access depending on the sensitivity of the case.
4. Audit Trails and Logging
Maintain audit logs of all streaming and access events for accountability and traceability.
Ensure logs are tamper-proof and stored in compliance with applicable data retention and judicial IT policies.
