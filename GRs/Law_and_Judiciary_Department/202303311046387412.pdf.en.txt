Preamble: Shri Siddhivinayak Ganapati Mandir Trust has started a 12-bed dialysis set up at the municipal corporation premises at Appasaheb Marathe Marg, Prabhadevi. A Dialysis Centre of 8 beds in 3 sessions was also started at Prabodhan, Goregaon in collaboration with Prabodhan, Goregaon Institute.
The number of corona patients in the country is increasing day by day. This disease requires long-term treatment. Since dialysis treatment is expensive, most patients give up treatment without undergoing long-term dialysis treatment. After careful consideration, the Trust has decided to implement an ambitious plan to provide dialysis treatment to at least 300 patients per day (in 3 shifts on 100 machines) in Mumbai. Considering the physical condition of the kidney affected patient, such patients prefer to get treated at the nearest dialysis centre, and therefore, the Trust has decided to implement this scheme in various parts of Mumbai in collaboration with other charitable institutions/ charitable institutions etc. The Dialysis Centre set up by Sai Multispeciality Hospital and Research Centre on the ground floor of Sai Multispeciality Hospital and Research Centre, Dharavi, was proposed to be run by Sai Multispeciality Hospital and Research Centre in association with Shri Siddhivinayak Ganapati Mandir Trust. This proposal was approved by the Trust Management Committee at its meeting dated 2 January 2023.
1655 was granted and it was decided that the proposal should be sent to the Government for approval. The Dialysis Centre set up at Sai Multispeciality Hospital and Research Centre, Dharavi has 10 machines and will be run as Shri Siddhivinayak Dialysis Centre. The day to day maintenance of this centre, electricity, water and rent etc. are the responsibility of Sai Multispeciality Hospital and Research Centre, Dharavi.
