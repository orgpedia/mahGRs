The Proposal:
Notaries are appointed district-wise and taluk-wise in the state of Maharashtra. For the appointment of notary, a circular is issued by the Notary Cell of the Department of Law and Justice and applications are invited from the willing candidates accordingly. Applications for notary appointments must be sent by speed post or registered post. However, if the application is not received within the stipulated time, the application will be rejected. In order to remove this error and to remove the inconvenience caused to the applicants, the process of inviting applications for the appointment of notary has been made online as per the central government.
The notary application has been developed by MahaOnline, a joint venture of the state government and Tata Consultancy Services, as per the requirement of the department. The application was later transferred from MahaOnline to the Directorate of Information and Technology for further maintenance.
Thereafter, after the Notaries (Third Amendment) Rules, 2019 were amended with effect from 06/11/2020, the said Rules required necessary changes in the Online Notary Application, such as appointment of notaries, renewal of certificates, online submission of annual returns of notaries, etc., in order to create efficiency and transparency in the online functioning of notaries. Accordingly, the Department had submitted a proposal to MahalT as per the instructions of the Directorate of Information and Technology for making necessary changes in the Notary's Online Application. In pursuance of the proposal, MahalT has recommended the appointment of a dedicated developer (technical land) by submitting a technical proposal to the department for the said work.
Accordingly, a proposal was under consideration of the government to create 1 notional post to take the services of a dedicated system developer from external agencies for the work of online notary application.
