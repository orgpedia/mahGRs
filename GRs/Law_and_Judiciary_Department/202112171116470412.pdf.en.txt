This has been approved in the meeting dated 03.02.2021.

In summary, the posts of Under Secretary (Law) are under the administrative control of the Department of Law and Justice but are not shown in the diagram of the Department of Law and Justice as they are sanctioned posts on the establishment of other ministerial departments.
Information about the posts in the cadre of Under Secretary (Law) was sought from all administrative departments in accordance with the demand letter sent to the Maharashtra Public Service Commission to fill the vacancies directly. The information submitted by the administrative departments shows that some departments have created the post of Deputy Secretary (Law) instead of Under Secretary (Law) on their establishment in the revised diagram. Therefore, it was under the consideration of the government to determine the procedure to be followed in accordance with the cadre of Under Secretary (Law)/ Deputy Secretary (Law)/ Joint Secretary (Law) and to instruct all administrative departments in this regard.
