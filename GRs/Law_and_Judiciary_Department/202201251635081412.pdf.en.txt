The Legislative Branch in the Department of Law and Justice is tasked with giving legal form to proposals sent by the ministerial departments on the decisions taken by the government on statutory proposals.

2. Statutory proposals which come to the Legislative Branch of the Department of Law and Justice from the Ministries for scrutiny and approval are not complete and hence unnecessary time is lost in their execution. Several legislative proposals were introduced during the session.
When they come, the law and justice department does not get the necessary time to examine the proposal and complete the process. Before a bill is introduced in the legislature or an ordinance. The draft goes through several stages to finalise before it is sent to the Governor, which takes several days. Many Ministries send statutory proposals to the Department of Law and Justice as soon as the session is near or during the session to check the legal and constitutional validity of the proposal and to introduce the bill in the Legislature immediately. There is a possibility of errors in the bills of such bills/ ordinances as sufficient time is not available to examine the legal and constitutional validity of such proposals and to prepare the draft of such proposals. Ministries are not aware of the process by which statutory proposals are passed before a Bill is introduced in the Legislature or an Ordinance is promulgated. When a statutory proposal comes to the Department of Law and Justice, the bill is not passed until it is introduced in the Legislature or the bill of ordinances is passed.

There will be no repetition and the time of the administrative department and the law and justice department as well as the legislature will be saved.
6. Instructions for promulgation of Ordinances:
Many Ministries, if any amendment is to be made in the Act, first submit a proposal to the Cabinet for promulgation of an Ordinance.
Regarding the ordinance, it is mentioned that the proposal of the ordinance should be submitted to make the amendments that are to be made immediately and it is not possible to wait until the legislature session. Other legislative proposals should be presented in the form of a bill. The term of the Ordinance expires after six weeks from the commencement of this session.
If the bill is not passed by the legislature, the
The amendments lapse and hence there is no protection for acts or proceedings in exercise of the provisions made under the Ordinance by the departments concerned. Also, if there are penal or punishment provisions in the amendments, it may lead to legal complications. If rules are to be made under the Ordinance, all the rules should be drafted in advance so that it is possible for the department to take action under the Ordinance.
Therefore, ordinances should rarely be used to amend the Act and preferably the proposals of Bills should be introduced. State of Bihar (2017) 3 SC 1 has elaborated the amendments made by the Ordinance and the consequences if the Ordinance is not converted into an Act.
Since every statutory proposal for the enactment of every Bill or Ordinance goes through more than 20 stages, the proposals for the same should be sent by the Ministry (Administrative) Department to the Department of Law and Justice as per the following schedule, so that the Legislative Branch can process the said proposals in time.
