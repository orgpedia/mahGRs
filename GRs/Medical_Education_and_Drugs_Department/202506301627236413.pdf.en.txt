Regarding grant of administrative approval to set up a library.
Government of Maharashtra
Department of Medical Education and Pharmaceuticals,
Government Decision No: EDG-2025 / Q. No.340 / PRAKSA-1
Gokuldas Tejpal Hospital premises, New G.T. Complex,
9th Floor, Mantralaya, Mumbai - 400 001.
Date: 30th June, 2025
Read: 1) Government Decision on serial numbers. 16/09/2024.
2) Letter from the Commissioner, Medical Education and Research, Mumbai No. Savishivas / Yansakh-M / E-Library Repurchase / 3677/2025, D 17/06/2025.
The Proposal:
Considering the increasing number of students in government medical colleges and colleges in the state, the institutions concerned and the students studying in them need to have access to a state-of-the-art and innovative pre-school education system. Considering the ever-increasing cost of many medical textbooks, TRAs, dissertations, medical-related materials and related matters, there are difficulties in making these materials available in the respective colleges. Also, these books cannot be used by all students at the same time as the number of printed books available in institutions is low. These books also have a high rate of early spoilage due to frequent use by students. With the e-Digital Library, world-class up-to-date medical materials will be easily available on mobiles and tabs to the faculty as well as students of Government Medical Colleges and Dental Colleges. This will add to their quality and will automatically receive updated editions of these books and educational materials.
E-library is also required for regulatory bodies like GAT SAT NMC / MCU / DCI / ING like NAAC.
In view of the above facts, the Directorate of Medical Education and Research has issued a notification under the aforesaid reference No. Administrative approval has been granted for the introduction of e-Digital Library in 22 Government Medical Colleges and 03 Dental Colleges under the Department by a Government Decision at 1. However, now the government was considering giving administrative approval to start e-digital libraries in the remaining 12 government medical colleges.
The government's decision:
In pursuance of the proposal submitted by the Directorate of Medical Education and Research for setting up of e-Digital Library for faculty, undergraduate and postgraduate students of Government Medical / Dental Colleges under the control of the Department as well as for undergraduate and postgraduate freshmen enrolled / pursuing in the next five academic years in the existing college, the remaining 12 Government Medical Colleges under the Department have been granted YT Policy Based Loan grant from Asian Development Bank (ADB) amounting to Rs. 47,12,42, 232 / - (Rupees Forty Seven Crore Twelve Lakh Forty Two Thousand Small Thirty Two Only) during the current financial year.
