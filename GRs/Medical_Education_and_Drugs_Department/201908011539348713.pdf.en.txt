Introduction: The government spends a huge amount on every student studying in government medical colleges. The fees charged by the students are very low in comparison to the cost. Since this expenditure is made by the public from the amount received by the government in accordance with the tax, the bond for government service is written by the students who complete the medical course from the government college with the aim of reimbursing it to some people. The medical services rendered by such candidates in Government of India or Government of India undertakings located in the State of Maharashtra, Government of Maharashtra or Government of Maharashtra undertakings/ local bodies or their undertakings and activities of Defence Forces and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) functioning in certain Naxalite affected, remote and tribal dominated taluks/ districts of the State are treated as" bonded services."

In order to encourage such private institutions and to give priority to cancer patients as soon as possible, it was under the consideration of the government to expand the scope of bonded services by considering the medical services done in that institution as" bonded services."
Government Decision:- Since the National Cancer Institute, Nagpur is working for cancer patients, in order to encourage and provide health services to cancer patients, the government is approving the medical services provided by the candidates who have completed their undergraduate/ postgraduate degree/ post-graduate diploma courses from government/ municipal colleges under this institution as a" bonded service."
