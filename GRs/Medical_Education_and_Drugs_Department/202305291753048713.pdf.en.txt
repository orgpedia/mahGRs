Government Decision No. MED 1023/ Q.No. 13/23/ Education-2
The new building of the hospital, 9th floor. the hospital complex,
Lokmanya Tilak Marg, New Mantralaya, Mumbai 400 001

Introduction: The cost of medical treatment for poor needy patients is often beyond the reach of their families. Therefore, there are many crowdfunding websites that are working to raise funds for the medical treatment of such patients. In this way, thousands of citizens raise funds for the treatment of their illness through crowdfunding. This provides financial relief to the patients and their relatives and many patients get life by getting proper treatment. However, the government has not laid down any rules/ procedures to get funds for medical treatment through crowdfunding.
After listening/ reading the grievances of the patients on the Crowd Funding website, many people, out of sympathy, deposit the possible financial help in the bank account mentioned on the website. If citizens are cheated through crowdfunding, then a useful system like crowdfunding will be discredited and people's trust will be lost and the crowdfunding system will not be available for poor needy patients. Also, the news about irregularities through crowdfunding websites and fake crowdfunding websites is unnecessarily discrediting a useful system like crowdfunding. Therefore, the government was considering the formation of a state-level committee to prepare government rules/ procedures for obtaining funds for the treatment of patients through crowd funding in the future.
GOVERNMENT DECISIONS:- A State Level Committee is being constituted to submit recommendations to the Government for the formulation of Government Rules/ Procedures to be followed while obtaining funds for the treatment of patients through Crowd Funding in the State as follows:
