The Institute of Nursing Education, Mumbai is one of the oldest government institutions teaching nursing courses and is headed by a principal. Except for the Nursing Education Institute, Mumbai, other government institutions come under the control of the dean of that medical college and hospital. The administrative issues/ financial issues faced by the institutions other than Nursing Education Institutions, Mumbai are resolved at the local level i.e. at the level of the Dean.
