Introduction: The hostel building for undergraduate students in the Government Ayurveda College, Nanded campus is very old and only 16 rooms are functional in it. Currently, 48 students are enrolled in the program. There are three students in one room. The building is very old and is a load bearing one. As such, the said building cannot be expanded and in view of the increased student strength (presently 100 students), the existing Degree Hostel building is inadequate. In order to ensure that the admitted undergraduate students of the college are not inconvenienced, it is necessary to operationalize the new undergraduate hostel by demolishing the old building to provide basic facilities to the students. Accordingly, in pursuance of the Dean's proposal for the construction of the proposed new building, the Director, AYUSH, has submitted a proposal to the Government for grant of administrative approval to the construction budget and plan submitted by the Public Works Department, Nanded. Accordingly, the matter of granting administrative approval to the said construction was under consideration of the Government.
