Read- 1) Govt. MED 1007/ CR- 490/07/ Education-2, dated 08/02/2008 2) Government Decision No. MED 1016/ PR No. 345/16/ Education-2, dated 05/01/2018
Introduction- The government/ municipal corporation spends a large amount on the education of students studying in government or municipal medical colleges in the state. The cost of education for these students is very low. Since the expenditure on the students is met from the tax revenue received from the public, the bond for service to the government/ local body/ defence forces is written at the time of admission so that the public debt is partially repaid. If the candidate refuses to perform this service or is found to be negligent for any reason, a fine will be imposed on them. A penalty of Rs 5 lakh has been prescribed for students admitted to BDS courses and Rs 10 lakh for students admitted from the academic year 2008-2009. After completing the MBBS course, many students are released from this service by paying a fine without serving the social obligation. However, in the wake of the Covid pandemic, it has been observed that there is an urgency for additional medical professionals in the government machinery. Therefore, the government was considering making the Social Responsibility Service mandatory for candidates who passed the MBBS course from the state.
Government's decision
The Government is providing recognition to the candidates who have passed the MBBS course from Government/ Municipal Medical College to perform the social responsibility service. As per the earlier order, the provision of exemption from this service by paying the fine amount without doing social responsibility service is being canceled. This provision will be applicable for candidates seeking admission to MBBS course in Government/ Municipal Medical Colleges from the academic year 2022-23.
Also, the students of MBBS course in Government Aided/ Private Unaided Medical Colleges who will avail the benefit of Government Scholarship/ Fee Reimbursement Scheme as per Government Decision dated 05/01/2018, are also required to perform social responsibility services. Candidates admitted to Government Aided/ Private Unaided Colleges from the academic year 2022-23 are also required to perform Social Responsibility Service and they cannot be exempted from this service by paying a penalty.
