Introduction: According to the World Health Organization standards, there should be 1 doctor for every 1000 population. Maharashtra is one of the most progressive states in India, especially in the field of medical education. However, according to the Economic Survey of Maharashtra 2020-2021, the ratio of doctors per 1000 population in the state of Maharashtra is 0.84. This is below the country-level average (0.90), which is very low by WHO standards. Due to the shortage of doctors in the state, most of the posts of doctors in the medical education department and public health department are vacant. As a result, the people in the semi-urban, rural, remote and inaccessible areas of the state face difficulties in providing basic health facilities.

However, with this limited medical service, it is becoming difficult to provide health care to the entire district. Accordingly, under the Medical Education and Pharmaceuticals Department, a new Government Medical College with an intake capacity of 100 students and an affiliated District General Hospital in Ratnagiri were under the consideration of the Government to establish a district hospital with 430 patients.
