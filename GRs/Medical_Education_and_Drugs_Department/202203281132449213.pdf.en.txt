However, according to the Economic Survey of Maharashtra 2020-2021, the ratio of doctors per 1000 population in the state of Maharashtra is 0.84. This is lower than the national average (0.90) and is in line with the World Health Organization (WHO) standards.

Accordingly, a new Government Medical College with an intake capacity of 100 students and a 430-bed hospital attached to it at Parbhani under the Medical Education and Pharmaceuticals Department was under the consideration of the Government.
