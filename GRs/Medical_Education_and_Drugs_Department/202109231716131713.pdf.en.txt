Government Resolution No: MED-2021/ PR No. 16/2021/ Education-1
9th Floor, Go to Hospital Complex, Lokmanya Tilak Marg,
Ministry, Mumbai- 400 001.
The date: September 23, 2021.
Introduction: In the state, health facilities are provided by the Public Health Department, Medical Education Department, Municipal Corporation and Municipality. However, since a large part of the state is rural, the people there and in small towns are facing a lack of quality and affordable medical facilities. At present, in many districts, district hospitals of the Public Health Service or hospitals of the Medical Education Department are working to provide health services. However, due to the shortage of doctors in the state, most of the posts of doctors in the medical education department and public health department are vacant. As a result, the people in the semi-urban, rural, remote and inaccessible areas of the state have very little access to basic health facilities.
Tertiary care is also required to be provided for many rare, hereditary, chronic diseases. Similarly, considering the continuous population growth, it is absolutely necessary to increase the number of doctors from the point of view of the health of the general public in the state and for this, it is necessary to create new government medical colleges in the state.
Accordingly, the Government of Maharashtra has set a target of providing affordable and highly specialized health care services by 2030. However, it faces the challenges of shortage of manpower required for healthcare and lack of affordable facilities. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought forth the urgency to augment the facilities in medical colleges and to set up new medical colleges and super specialty hospitals.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there should be 1 doctor per 1000 population. In this regard, India's doctor ratio is 1000: 0.60 (124th rank) as compared to other developed countries. The state has 0.64 MBBS doctors per 1,000 population. Also, there is an acute shortage of medical specialists and super-specialists and only 1/5 th of the required number of super-specialists are available in India.
The ratio of MBBS to post-graduation is 3:1 in India as compared to 1:4 in developed countries. Considering the current rate of availability of new post-graduates every year, it is going to take around 15-40 years to reach the required ratio.

Government Decision No: MED-2021/ P.S. 16/2021/ Education-1 4. As per the norms of National Medical Commission, a minimum of 20 acres of contiguous land is required for a new Government Medical College. As per the norms of the National Medical Commission, a minimum of 300-bed hospital is mandatory for the first year for the construction of a new government medical college. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has decided to set up a new medical college. 29.12.2015 and D. The Medical Colleges Establishment (Amendment) Rules, 2015 and the Medical Colleges Establishment (Amendment) Rules, 2016 have been published vide notification dated 02.02.2016. The scheme envisages setting up of medical colleges with a capacity of 300 beds in Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode.
Accordingly, the Government lacks financial resources to set up a new medical college as it requires large amount of funds for construction, financing, operation and maintenance of extensive land and infrastructure. Therefore, the gap in resources such as manpower, financial provision, etc. for setting up new medical colleges can be bridged with the participation of the private sector. For this, it is proposed to set up a Government Medical College and Super Specialty Hospital through Private Finance Initiative (PFI) and Public Private Partnership (PPP).
Objectives of the proposed policy: a) To provide a source of funding for the construction of new Government Medical Colleges through PPP.
(b) To enhance the facilities of medical education in super-speciality health care, undergraduate and postgraduate.
Strengthening of postgraduate teaching in existing Government Medical Colleges and creation of skilled specialist manpower.
(e) To create trained paramedical and nursing manpower by establishing paramedical and nursing colleges.
a) To provide financing through the Viability Gap Fund (VGF) from the Central Government through commercially viable PPPs.
a) Protecting the interests of patients and staff. To prepare a balanced contractual framework for the proper return of the private partner's investment.
Establish an independent mechanism (Authority/ Corporation/ similar mechanism) to implement the proposed policy and achieve the targets set by 2030.
7. Accordingly, in order to meet the shortfall in funds for setting up of medical colleges and augmenting health facilities, NITI Aayog and the Union Finance Ministry have issued guidelines on Public Private Partnership (PPP) principle for increased private sector participation. Further, the Union Ministry of Finance vide its Guidelines dated 07.12.2020 issued Guidelines for providing financial assistance for setting up of medical colleges and augmentation of health facilities in the social sector on Public Private Partnership basis through Viability Gap Fund (VGF).
