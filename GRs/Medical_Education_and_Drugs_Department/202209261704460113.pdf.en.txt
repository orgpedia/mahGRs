As per Section 9 of the Postgraduate Medical Education Regulations, 2000 of the Medical Council of India (MCI)/ National Medical Commission (NMC), at present 50% of the seats in the Postgraduate Diploma Courses are reserved for in-service candidates. However, there is no provision in the said Regulations regarding applicability of reservation to in-service candidates for admissions to Post Graduate Medical Courses.
Also, the Postgraduate Medical Education Regulations, 2000 do not prohibit the application of reservation to in-service candidates for admission to post-graduate courses. 1 mentioned above. This has been made clear by the Supreme Court Judgment dated 31/08/2020. Similarly, it is clear from the said judgment that the State Government is competent to reserve seats for admission to Post Graduate Medical Courses for Medical Officers under the said Service.

Considering this, the government was considering issuing a revised order regarding the proportion of quota under the service for admission to post-graduate and post-graduate diploma courses in government/ municipal medical colleges.
