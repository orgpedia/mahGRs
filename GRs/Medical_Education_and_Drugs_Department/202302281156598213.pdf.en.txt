The Proposal:
Department of Public Health As per the Government decision dated 26.07.2017, Haffkine Corporation has set up a procurement cell for the various departments of the Government and local bodies to procure medicines, related consumables and medical equipment etc. Besides, procurement of machinery, equipment, drugs, surgicals materials and related items required for the health institutions under the Public Health Department, Government Medical Colleges and Hospitals under the Directorate of Medical Education and Research will also be done. It was made mandatory to do it through Haffkine Corporation. Accordingly, funds will be drawn by the Institute on short payments for the purchase of machinery, equipment, medicines, surgicals materials and other related matters required by the Health Institutions under the Public Health Department and the Directorate of Medical Education and Research. Haffkine is transferred to the purchasing room of the corporation. The above items are supplied to the respective organizations by conducting a tender process through the corporation for the purchase of various items from the funds transferred to Haffkine Corporation. However, due to various technical and administrative reasons, there was a delay in the supply of these items to the institutions by implementing the tender process through Haffkine Corporation. Therefore, due to the difficulties in patient care, the institutions may refrain from submitting the requisition letter. The government was considering setting up a standard operating procedure (SOP) to improve the procurement process through the Haffkine Corporation's procurement cell. Based on this, the following decisions are taken.
