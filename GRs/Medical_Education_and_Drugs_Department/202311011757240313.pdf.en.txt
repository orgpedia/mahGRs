Introduction: According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there should be 1 doctor for every 1000 population. Maharashtra is one of the most progressive states in India, especially in the field of medical education. However, according to the Economic Survey of Maharashtra 2020-2021, the ratio of doctors per 1000 population in the state of Maharashtra is 0.84. This is below the country-level average (0.90) and is very low by WHO standards. At present, most of the posts of doctors in the medical education department and public health department are vacant due to shortage of doctors in the state. As a result, the people in the semi-urban, rural, remote and inaccessible areas of the state face difficulties in providing basic health facilities. Considering the increase in the population of the state and the awareness created about medical education and health facilities, it is necessary to establish new government medical colleges.
As a large part of the state's Hingoli district is rural, there is a lack of quality and affordable medical facilities in the district. At present, the district hospital is under the control of the district health department. However, this limited medical service is not enough to provide health care to the district concerned. Therefore, the government was considering the establishment of a new government medical college with a capacity of 100 students and a hospital with 430 patients attached to it in Hingoli district.
Accordingly, the proposal dated 16.09.2023 was approved. The decision was taken at the Cabinet meeting.
Government's decision:
A new Government Medical College at Hingoli with an intake capacity of 100 students and an attached 430-bed hospital is being approved with the approval of the National Medical Commission.
