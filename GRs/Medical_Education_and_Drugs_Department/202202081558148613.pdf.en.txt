Government Resolution Department of Medical Education and Pharmaceuticals No.- MES-1508/ PR No. 94/ 08/ Vaisva-1, dated 7/9/2011 2) Government Resolution Department of General Administration No. 2715/ PR. No. 100/13, dated 17/12/2016
Introduction: Due to the shortage of specialist and experienced doctors and their reluctance to enter government service, the government has always faced the problem of appointing such doctors to the post of senior faculty in government medical colleges. This is especially true for medical and health care issues. Clinical and super specialty doctors are not very inclined towards government service as they earn well from private business. This has an adverse effect on the health and well-being of students. Apart from this, the delay in regular appointments for one reason or another also adds to the problem.
Therefore, making temporary appointments on contract basis till the availability of regular candidates for such senior faculty positions is an effective solution to this problem. Reference No. (1) Provisions have been made in respect of the procedure, terms and conditions, honorarium etc. regarding the appointment of professors, group-A and associate professors, group-A posts in the Government Medical, Ayurveda and Dental Colleges in the State through contractual mode. Recently, new government medical colleges and affiliated hospitals have been set up in many places in the state. At least one government medical college is likely to be set up in every district in the future. In addition, recently, a super speciality hospital attached to the Government Medical College has been established. More such hospitals will be set up in the future.
