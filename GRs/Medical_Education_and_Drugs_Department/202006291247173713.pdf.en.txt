11. Investigational Therapies
Convalescent plasma (Off Label) may be considered in patients with moderate disease who are not improving (oxygen requirement is progressively increasing) despite use of steroids.
Special prerequisites while considering convalescent plasma include:
ABO compatibility and cross matching of the donor plasma
Neutralizing titer of donor plasma should be above the specific threshold (if the latter is not available, plasma IgG titer ( against S-protein RBD) above 1:640 should be used)
Recipient should be closely monitored for several hours post transfusion for any transfusion related adverse events
Use should be avoided in patients with IgA deficiency or immunoglobulin allergy
Dose: Dose is variable ranging from 4 to 13 ml/kg (usually 200 ml single dose given slowly over not less than 2 hours.
However, appropriate action should be taken regarding the use of Convalescent Plasma (Off Label) therapy in all government/ semi-government/ private/ municipal/ municipal council/ charitable/ private hospitals dedicated to COVID-19 in the state by strictly following the instructions in the relevant guidelines.
The patient-wise information regarding the treatment to be done in all government/ semi-government/ private/ municipal/ municipal council/ charitable/ private hospitals dedicated to COVID-19 through this treatment program should be collected separately along with the information of the plasma donor. The study was conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO), National Institute of Virology (NIV), and National Institute of Virology. Action should be taken to make available to the Collector/ Municipal Commissioner etc.
