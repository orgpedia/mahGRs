The Administrative Sanction Order dated 30.03.2021 of the Government of Maharashtra to Rajarshi Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj Government Medical College, Kolhapur has inadvertently mentioned the title as" Administrative Sanction for Procurement of Machinery from Grant Sanctioned under District Annual Plans for the Financial Year 2020-2021." Instead, it should read" Administrative approval for purchase of furniture for residential accommodation under 13 office expenditure targets for FY 2020-21."
