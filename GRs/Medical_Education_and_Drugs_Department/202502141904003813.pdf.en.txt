The Proposal: -
The state has 25 government medical colleges, 3 dental colleges, 5 nursing colleges, 1 vocational and physical college under the Department of Medical Education and Pharmaceuticals.
The College (OT PT), 6 Ayurveda Colleges and 1 Homeopathy College are functioning today. These colleges include MBBS, PG, Superspeciality, BDS, BAMS, BHMS,
Students are admitted to a wide variety of courses such as Physical and Professional College (OT PT), Nursing, Paramedical, etc.
The life cycle since the student's admission to government institutions today presents numerous difficulties in accessibility, making it difficult for students who pass out of government institutions to obtain various certificates, documents from the college in the future.
