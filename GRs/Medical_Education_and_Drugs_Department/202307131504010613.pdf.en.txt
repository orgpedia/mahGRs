Preamble: Proposals for grant of approval to the Dean, Government Medical College, Satara, Kolhapur, Miraj and Ratnagiri to provide four-wheeler vehicles on hire for their office work. 5 to 8 have been submitted to the Government. As the vehicles used by the Dean, Rajarshi Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj Government Medical College, Kolhapur and the Dean, Government Medical College, Miraj, have been in use for more than 20 years, the process of delineation is underway in respect of these vehicles. The dean of the newly established government medical colleges in Satara and Ratnagiri have not yet been provided with vehicles. Therefore, the matter of allowing the Deans of these institutions to provide four-wheelers on rent for their office work was under the consideration of the government. Accordingly, the following decisions are taken:
