The Proposal:
Rule 80 to 83 of the M.N.S. (Leave) Rules, 1981 provides for grant of study leave to Government servants in view of the urgency of public service to complete a special course involving higher education or specialized training in a trade or technical subject directly or closely related to their field of duty, within or outside India.
Accordingly, since the Government is empowered to grant study leave to the officers/ employees of the Regional Office and the offices under them to complete the courses related to the above mentioned areas, it is necessary to submit the appropriate proposal for the approval of the Government in advance before the commencement of the course and issue appropriate Government Order accordingly.
(3) If the staff working in the nursing category under the supplementary letter of reference is admitted to private nursing institutions without getting admission to the seats in the government nursing education institution for some reason, then the study leave will be admissible to the employees under this service. However, the concerned employee should have participated in the admission process for reserved seats in the government nursing institute. Subject to this condition, provision has been made for grant of study leave to the employees admitted in private nursing institutions.
