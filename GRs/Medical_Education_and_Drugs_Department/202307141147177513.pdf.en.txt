Introduction: According to the World Health Organization standards, there should be 1 doctor for every 1000 population.
Maharashtra is one of the most progressive states in India and is considered a leading state in the field of education, especially in the field of medical education. However, according to the Economic Survey 2020-2021 of Maharashtra, the ratio of doctors per 1000 population in the state is 0.84. This is below the country-level average (0.90) and is very low by WHO standards. Due to the shortage of doctors in the state, most of the posts of doctors in the medical education department and public health department are vacant. As a result, the people in the semi-urban, rural, remote and inaccessible areas of the state face difficulties in providing basic health facilities. Considering the increase in the population of the state and the awareness created about medical education and health facilities, it is necessary to establish new government medical colleges.
Most of the districts in the state, including Palghar, Thane (Ambernath), Jalna, Amravati, Buldhana, Washim, Wardha, Bhandara and Gadchiroli, are rural and lack quality and affordable medical facilities. At present, these hospitals are under the purview of the state health department. However, this limited medical service is not enough to provide health care to the district concerned. Therefore, the government was considering to set up a new government medical college with a capacity of 100 students each and a hospital with 430 patients attached to it in the districts of Palghar, Thane (Ambernath), Jalna, Amravati, Buldhana, Washim, Wardha, Bhandara and Gadchiroli which do not have a government medical college.
Accordingly, the proposal dated 28.06.2023 was approved. The decision was taken at the Cabinet meeting.
Government's decision:
The new government medical college with a capacity of 100 students each and 430 hospitals attached to it in the districts of Palghar, Thane (Ambernath), Jalna, Amravati, Buldhana, Washim, Wardha, Bhandara and Gadchiroli, which do not have government medical colleges, will be set up by the central government.
After approval, it will be launched.
