Introduction: According to the World Health Organization standards, there should be 1 doctor for every 1000 population. At present, the state has one doctor per 1,000 population.

As a result, the people in the semi-urban, rural, remote and inaccessible areas of the state face difficulties in providing basic health facilities. Considering the increase in the population of the state and the awareness about medical education and health facilities, it is necessary to start new government medical colleges.
Also, many government colleges affiliated to Maharashtra University of Health Sciences, Nashik,
A variety of health science courses are offered by both private and public institutions. However, the university is yet to set up its own undergraduate and postgraduate institutes.
Accordingly, considering the medical facilities available in the state, the government was considering the establishment of a new medical college with an intake capacity of 100 students and an attached hospital of 430 beds at the Maharashtra University of Health Sciences, Nashik.
Besides, the government was also considering setting up a Maharashtra Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research to promote state-of-the-art ultra-speciality health care and research under the Medical Education Department.
