Introduction: Department of Public Health. As per the Government decision dated 26.07.2017, it has been made mandatory for Government Medical/ Dental/ Ayurveda Colleges and Hospitals under the Department of Medical Education and Pharmaceuticals to procure necessary machinery, equipment, instruments, medicines, surgicals materials and related items through Haffkine Corporation. Accordingly, 10% of the budgeted funds under the target of Supplies and Supplies for Medicines, Surgical Materials and Other Matters (21) are earmarked for the purchase of medicines, surgical materials and related matters at the institutional level in case of emergency. The delay in the supply of medicines and other items to the institutions is due to the non-receipt of administrative approval for the purchase of medicines, surgical materials and related items from various departments of the government at the same time, delay in receiving the distribution list from the department, insufficient manpower and facilities at the procurement room, delay in the implementation of the tender process to the Haffkine Corporation, and the supply of the demanded medicinal items is being done by the supplier in a phased manner. Therefore, the government was considering to increase the limit of 10 percent fixed for the purchase of medicines and other items at the local level so that the shortage of medicines in hospitals does not affect the patient's service. The government is taking the following steps:
