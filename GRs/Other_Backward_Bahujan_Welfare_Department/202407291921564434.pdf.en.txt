Introduction: - Residential Ashramshalas are run by this department on a 100% subsidized basis for children belonging to the Visva-Bharj category. Some of these primary ashramshalas were upgraded to secondary ashramshalas, while some secondary schools were upgraded to residential higher secondary ashramshalas over time. At present, about 980 primary, secondary and higher secondary ashramshalas are functioning under the department. The Ashramshalas run by NGOs are doing a valuable job to ensure the student's economic, social and educational progress. Free accommodation, food, health facilities, sports facilities, educational materials, toiletries, dining utensils, etc. are being provided by the Ashramshala to the boys and girls of the Visva-Bharj category with education from classes 1 to 12.
For this, the government provides non-salaried grants to the relevant agencies.
2. The student admitted to the Ashramshala of the Vijabhabja category is primarily a resident. Such students are restricted from washing their own clothes during the Ashramshala period. Considering the age of these students, self-cleaning becomes cumbersome and consumes a lot of student time.
As a result, children do not have enough time to play outdoor games for study. Unhygienic and unhygienic washing of clothes leads to the formation of microbes in it. This can lead to skin diseases in students. Therefore, providing a VISABHAJ TRTAT Gt SAAMI Aah ART AMA (Commercial Washing Machine) will help the student to wash his / her clothes cleanly and save the time of the students who waste washing their clothes and use this time for their studies and other academic activities.
