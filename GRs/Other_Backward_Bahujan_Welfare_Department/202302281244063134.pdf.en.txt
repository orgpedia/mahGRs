Read above. 8 here. As per the decision of the Government dated 29.11.2022, 72 Government Hostels with a capacity of 100 students, 1 for boys and 1 for girls at each district level for students pursuing post-matriculation vocational education belonging to Other Backward Classes, Vimukt Jati, Nomadic Tribes and Special Backward Classes will be started by taking rented buildings at 36 district locations through Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) registered under the Bombay Public Trust Act, 1950 and the Societies Registration Act, 1860. An amount of Rs. 73.81 crore has been sanctioned. However, there were reports in newspapers about some OBC organisations and individuals expressing displeasure over the handing over of hostels to NGOs. Considering this, the opinion that the hostels should be run by the government instead of allowing the NGOs to run them, the matter of taking a decision on whether the government itself should rent a building for the hostel to run the hostels was under consideration, according to which the following decision is being taken.
Instead of providing hostels to NGOs registered under the Bombay Public Trust Act, 1950 and the Societies Registration Act, 1860, the Government has taken a decision to operate 72 hostels per year for a total of 7200 eligible students per year for 36 districts within the limit of 100 boys and 100 girls belonging to Other Backward Classes, Vimukt Jati, Nomadic Tribes and Special Backward Classes in each district.
