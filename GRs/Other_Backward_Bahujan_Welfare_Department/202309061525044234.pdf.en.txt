Motimahal Building Churchgate, Mumbai 400 32
Date: 6th of September 2023
Reference:-Government Decision No. 2023/ No. 14/ Corporations, d. 9th August, 2023
The Proposal:
In the Budget Speech dated 09.03.2023, Issue No. In the backdrop of the announcement made under section 66, the relevant direction was issued to establish Raje Umaji Naik Economic Development Corporation (subsidiary) under the existing Vasantrao Naik Vimukta Jati and Nomadic Tribes Development Corporation for the social, educational and economic upliftment of the Ramoshi community among the Vimukta Jati and Nomadic Tribes of the state. It has been approved under the Government Decision dated 09/08/2023.
However, Ramoshi, Berad and similar castes are one and the same, as their practices, customs, customs and professions are the same, and in the list of exempted castes, No. 01 Berad ((similar caste) and No. The Government has received a request to mention Ramoshi as well as Berad (Ramoshi-Berad) in the relevant Government Resolution as the mention of Ramoshi in 11 is likely to hinder the benefits of the above subsidiary to the Berad community.
Accordingly, it was under consideration of the Government to modify the above-mentioned Government Decision.
Government's decision:
the above reference. The functions and schemes of the Raje Umaji Naik Economic Development Corporation (subsidiary), which has been set up under the Government decision dated 09.08.2023, will be applicable to the Ramoshi community as well as the Berad (Ramoshi-Berad) community.
