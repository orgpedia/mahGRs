Validity of non-creamy layer certificate issued by the competent authority in respect of officers/ employees belonging to the categories of caste, nomadic tribes, Other Backward Classes and Special Backward Classes. In Petition No. 7456/2012 filed in the High Court, Bombay, Hon. Considering the directions of the court, it is necessary to examine. Procedure for verification of non-creamy layer certificate. 31.01.2020 has been prescribed. For this, all the cases of verification of non-creamy layer certificate validity by the concerned office head as well as various administrative departments of the state government are sent to the concerned Divisional Commissioner (Revenue). Such verification cases are referred by the Divisional Commissioner (Revenue) to a sub-committee headed by the District Collector under his administrative control.
In accordance with the above procedure, the concerned Collector is required to submit a factual report along with self-explanatory feedback to the Divisional Commissioner (Revenue) for final decision after verifying the same within a period of 30 days from the receipt of the case from him. The decision was taken by the Divisional Commissioner (Revenue). As on 23.02.2021, there is a provision to take a decision in this regard within a period of minimum 3 to maximum 6 months.
6. Appointment to the posts reserved for the categories of Vimukta Jati, Nomadic Tribes, Other Backward Classes and Special Backward Classes selected through the direct service recruitment process in the State is processed by the concerned establishment on the basis of the caste certificate and caste validity certificate of the candidate. However, no benefits are admissible on the basis of caste certificate and caste validity certificate alone without valid non-creamy layer verification certificate. It will be appropriate for the candidates belonging to the backward classes to be appointed on the basis of the verification of the non-creamy layer certificate. However, for verification of non-criminal certificate, the concerned establishments/ offices have not fixed the time within which such cases should be forwarded to the Divisional Commissioner Revenue and the cases received by them by the Divisional Revenue to the concerned Collector for further action. Considering the time taken and the delay in verifying the non-crimilier certificate, since the candidates who are eligible for appointment are facing difficulties in giving appointment to the candidate in the absence of verification certificate, the matter was under the consideration of the government to prescribe a definite time period for the verification of the non-crimilier certificate by the sub-committee at the level of the Collector and the committee at the level of the Divisional Commissioner Revenue.
GOVERNMENT DECISION: All the concerned authorities are hereby informed to follow the following procedure for verification/ appeal of non-creamy layer certificate of the candidates selected/ recommended for appointment to the posts reserved for the categories of Vimukt Jati, Nomadic Tribes, Other Backward Classes and Special Backward Classes through direct recruitment process in the State:
