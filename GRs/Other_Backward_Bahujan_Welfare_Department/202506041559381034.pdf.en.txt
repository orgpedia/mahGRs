Government Decision No: Divisions-2019 / Q.No.1042 / VIJABHAJ-1
a) Private Aided Residential Ashramshalas for the Backward Classes run by NGOs under the Other Backward Classes Bahujan Kalyan Department in Naxal-affected / tribal areas (villages / towns declared as Naxal-affected / tribal by the Government from time to time).
Time-bound promotion / Assured Progress Scheme for teaching and non-teaching staff or
The one-tier promotion scheme is the first of the two schemes under which he will be eligible for the benefit, as the financial benefit under both the schemes is the same. Therefore, after receiving benefits under one scheme, it is not meant to be given separately under another scheme.
Accordingly, the benefit of the pay scale of the senior position of promotion should be given. Thereafter, the employee will not be entitled to the same benefit separately under the second scheme if he / she is already drawing the pay scale of the senior position of promotion at the time when he / she becomes eligible for the benefit under the second scheme in the future.
The above explanation is summarized as follows: In Naxalite affected / tribal areas (Govt.
Villages / towns declared as Naxal-affected / tribal from time to time) belonging to the Visabhabhaj category run by NGOs under the Other Backward Classes Bahujan Welfare Department.
Teachers and non-teaching staff in private aided residential ashramshalas should not apply for another scheme after receiving benefits under one scheme. That is, when the benefit under one scheme is paid and the benefit under another scheme becomes payable, it is not meant to recover the benefit under the first scheme and apply the benefit of the second scheme. Also, while the benefit of the first scheme continues, it is also not intended to apply the benefit of a higher grade of pay to it under the second scheme.
b) If a senior position exists for promotion from a position held under the Entry into Service Rules, the benefit of the pay scale of the promoted position must be given in such a case. However, if the promotion is from a position held by the service entry rule
Salary if there is no opportunity for promotion due to the non-existence of a senior position to be offered
The benefits of the pay scale which is mentioned close to the pay scale of the original post held in the Commission's Manual are required to be paid.
Teachers and non-teaching staff of private aided residential ashramshalas of the weaker sections run by NGOs under Other Backward Classes Bahujan Kalyan Department in Naxal affected / tribal areas (villages / towns declared as Naxal affected / tribal by the Government from time to time).
The following action should be taken in respect of sanction of one-tier promotion scheme (senior / promotional rank closer to the original post) to the subordinates.

Such teaching and non-teaching staff, after being posted in a Naxal-affected area, immediately after appointment, are given a one-tier promotion scheme, according to which the pay scale of the senior position in which they are working should be approved.
2) Deprivation of promotion for 12 years from the date of appointment entitles one to the guaranteed promotion scheme under the service. However, if he is drawing the pay scale of an ARS post under a one-time scheme, the employee will not be entitled to the first benefit of the guaranteed progression scheme under the service.
3) After 24 years of total service from the date of appointment, he will be paid the second benefit of the progress scheme guaranteed under the service. For example, since the basic rank of appointment under the One Level Progress Scheme has been replaced by that of the ARS rank of promotion, after 24 years, the pay scale of the senior most post of promotion will be applicable as a second benefit of the Promised Progress Scheme.
4) The original appointment has been made in tribal / naxal affected areas and the transferable teachers / non-teaching staff outside tribal / naxal affected areas within the institute will not be transferred in future.
The pay scale of the post in which the employee is working will be admissible by discontinuing the benefit of one-time promotion given to the teacher / non-teaching staff concerned after he / she is posted in a tribal / Naxal affected area. While making the pay scale of that post permissible, she
From the date of his appointment to the post, the hypothetical salary will be fixed and paid accordingly.
5) Teachers / non-teaching staff working in tribal / Naxal affected areas will be eligible for the benefit of the Guaranteed Progress Scheme under the Employees' Service if they are transferred to a non-tribal / Naxal affected after being eligible for the Guaranteed Progress Scheme under the Service. In such a case, he / she will be entitled to the benefit of the service-assured progress scheme from the date on which he / she becomes eligible for the service-assured progress scheme when he / she is working in a tribal / Naxal-affected area.
The actual salary will be payable from the date on which he joins the non-tribal / Naxal affected areas by fixing the fictitious salary.
6) In case of transfer to non-tribal / Naxal affected areas even before they become eligible for the service-assured progress plan, they will be entitled to the benefit of the service-assured progress plan from the date they become eligible for the service-assured progress plan.
7) The original appointment has been made in non-tribal / Naxal affected areas and the teacher / non-teaching staff concerned becomes eligible for the one-tier promotion scheme after the transfer of transferable teachers and non-teaching staff in tribal / Naxal affected areas within the institute to tribal / Naxal affected areas in future. If the teacher and non-teaching staff are not availing the pay scale of the senior post of promotion under the promised PRAGATI scheme after their transfer to tribal / naxalite affected areas, a one-tier promotion scheme should be implemented to the employee concerned after the tribal / naxalite affected transfer.
