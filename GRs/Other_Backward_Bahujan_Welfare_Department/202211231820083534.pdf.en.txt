Government Resolution No: Vibhasha-2022/ No.44/ Vijabhaj-1
Ministry Extension Building, 1st Floor,
Hutatma Rajguru Chowk, Madam Cama Marg,
Ministry, Mumbai- 400 032.
The date is November 23, 2022.
Reference:- Government Decision, School Education and Sports Department No.
Shiguvi 2015/ (80/15) S.D.6, D. 22nd June, 2015
The vision of National Education Policy 2020 is: An education system that contributes to creating an equitable and vibrant knowledge society by providing high quality education to all.
Develop a sense of respect for fundamental rights, duties and constitutional values, a relationship with one's country and a conscious awareness of one's role and responsibilities in a changing world.
To inculcate skills, values and temperament that will reflect a truly global citizenry that supports human rights, sustainable development and survival and global well-being.
The three components of National Education Policy (NEP), taken together, are high quality education (highest quality globally), awareness of one's role and responsibilities in a changing world (predictive) and reflection of global citizenry (global citizen). It can be called a' world-class predictive education' in one word group. Therefore, the implementation of world-class futuristic education can also be called the implementation of the New Education Policy.
NIPUN Bharat programme is being implemented across India as part of the National Education Policy. Under this, all the states of India, including Maharashtra, are trying to ensure that all (80%) children in the country up to the third grade have foundational literacy and numeracy (FLN), in short, by 2026. In contrast, all ashramshalas run by the Other Backward Bahujan Welfare Department are working towards achieving FLN as part of the Nipun Bharat programme.
The State's Department of Vimukta Jati and Nomadic Tribes will implement the National Education Policy and Nipun Bharat through world-class futuristic education. This is the government's policy.
As we all know, every child is unique. All children learn at different speeds. All students learn at different levels.
That is, under the NIPUN Bharat programme, while working to ensure that all children get FLN, it will be seen that in every class, some children have already achieved the level of FLN. While the work of bringing other children up to FLN level is going on, there is a need to bring clarity on what to do with the child who has reached FLN level. If no separate educational work is done with these children, the education of these children may be at a loss.
Foundational Literacy and Numeracy (FLN): (a) Development of oral language in mother tongue: To develop language and literacy in primary school class, good listening comprehension skills, print and phonetic awareness in pre-school class.

Government Resolution No: Vibhasha-2022/ No.44/ Vijabhaj-1
And the correct display of the school language, including the development of emerging reading and writing skills, is important.
The pre-existing knowledge of language helps in building literacy skills in languages. Children who have a strong mother tongue foundation can learn English/ second language more easily.
The major components of foundational language and literacy are: 1. Oral Language Development:- Experience in oral language is important for developing reading and writing skills.
Phonological Awareness: Understanding the phonology of language. This domain includes word awareness, rhyme awareness, and awareness of sounds in words (so that the script is easier to learn), which must stem from their semantic engagement with the language.
3. Decoding:- This domain includes awareness of printed text, letter knowledge and understanding of printed letters and ability to recognize words: 4. Vocabulary:- This domain includes skills of verbal vocabulary, reading/ writing vocabulary and analysis of meaning and structure of words.
Reading Comprehension: This domain includes the skills of understanding the text and extracting information from it, as well as interpreting the text.
Reading fluency:- It is related to the accuracy, speed (automatism), expressive (prosody), and comprehension in the ability to read text so that children can extract meaning from the text.
7. Concept of Printing: Children need to be exposed to different types of print rich environment to develop comprehension, writing skills.
Writing:- This domain includes the ability to write letters and words as well as writing for expression.
Culture of reading/ inclination towards reading:- Includes motivation to engage in different kinds of books and other reading materials.
Foundational Numeracy Skills: Foundational numeracy is the ability to reason and apply simple numerical concepts in solving problems in everyday life. The development of pre-computation and number concepts during pre-school, the knowledge and skills of comparing, sorting, classifying, and identifying patterns serve as the foundation for learning mathematics in elementary classes. The major aspects and components of elementary mathematics are as follows: 1. Pre-Number Concept:- To understand the number system in the context of counting.
Action on Numbers and Numbers:- Knowing the rules needed to master mathematical techniques such as the use of the base ten system to represent numbers.
Measurement:- Understanding and using standard algorithms to perform operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division on numbers up to three digits.
4. Shape and spatial perception: Simple calculations up to three-digit numbers in his/ her own way and applying them to different contexts in their daily life.
Patterns: Knowing the vocabulary of words to enhance his/ her understanding of space and spatial objects.
The next level of FLN in our country is the National Achievement Survey (NAS), in short, conducted by the Government of India. From this it seems that children who have reached FLN need to do educational work to reach the level of NAS. But the children's learning
# Page 3
Government Resolution No: Vibhasha-2022/ No.44/ Vijabhaj-1
Since the speed varies, it is likely that some children in each class have reached NAS levels as well. That is, the task of taking those children to the next level of NAS has to be done.
The next level of NAS is PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment). Of course, the children who will reach the NAS level will have to undertake educational activities to take them up to the PISA level.
The aim of this government decision is to provide education to all the children of VJBJ Ashramshala according to their level.
(c) Methods of teaching according to level: These have been given different names in different periods of education. Some of them are follows:
Multigrade Teaching: It is the teaching of more than one class of children together. This is how it is supposed to be taught in bicultural schools. But as we just discussed every child has a different learning level. So, even though they are studying in the same class, they are not at the same level of learning, so it is clear that children in the same class also need multi-class teaching. Therefore, multidisciplinary teaching is not an educationally complete method.
Multi-level teaching: This method considers the level of each child. However, a single teacher is expected to teach 30 children in a class or 30 children in multiple classes at 30 different levels. For this, the teacher has to take the help of many educational materials, as well as children's peer learning, and group learning. Therefore, different types of learning processes have to be used while doing multi-level teaching. Therefore, it is better to call it multi-level learning. Therefore, many education experts of the world call it multi-level learning.
Teaching at Right Level (TARL):- It is currently being implemented in some parts of the state of Bihar. It is a form of multi-level teaching. But the word is used in teaching. This means that there is more emphasis on learning than teaching.
Self-Determined Learning: It is also known as heutagogy. Children decide what they want to learn and how they want to learn. Since children decide their own way of learning, it automatically takes care of the fact that each child is unique and each child has a different learning level. It is clear that this method itself is multilevel learning. It also takes care of the theory of Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), as well as Howard Gardner& Nine Intelligences.
This last process is expected to be carried out in the ashramshalas of the V.J.B.J. class.
For this, the EMBC department has planned the training and the work of preparing its training component kits is currently underway. (MOLIS-Management of Learning Intervention in Schools for Principals and MOLIH-Management of Learning Intervention in Hostels for Hostel Superintendents)

Evolution of the Learning at Right Level in Maharashtra: Before the implementation of the Advanced Education Maharashtra program in the state, where in the government system do 100 percent of the children get the basic mathematical activity? According to the FLN (Annual Survey of Education Report) of that time, 100 percent of the children are successful in mathematics and language? This was reported. At that time, Kumthe Beet of Satara district (Ta. It was observed that all the 40 school children in Satara have crossed the ASER level (now FLN). Kumthe Beat has 100 per cent government schools but all children can reach FLN level, while all children in all 66,000 government-run schools in the state can reach FLN level. With this belief, the government decided to implement the Advanced Education Maharashtra program through the School Education and Sports Department. The state government has worked hard to ensure that 100 per cent of the children in the state learn. All the teachers in the state worked very hard. It includes Beed district's Gevrai, Aurangabad district's Garkheda, Chandrapur district's Tadali and Nashik district's Niphad. The result of the hard work done by the teachers of the state is seen by analyzing the ASER report of 2014, 2016 and 2018. They're coming.
Objective achieved: The Chief Minister had given a target to bring Maharashtra to the first 3 states in India as per the ASER report. As per ASER 2018, children of class III were ranked first three in the country in reading ability. All this was the result of the tireless work of the teachers.
The learning outcomes of children in the third grade are significant because these children were enrolled in school during that regime. Kerala stood first, followed by Maharashtra. This applies to both government and private schools. However, in Maharashtra, the government schools were ahead of the private schools. Considering this, when comparing Kerala and Maharashtra on the results of government schools, Maharashtra was at the top in the country. In Kerala, private schools were ahead of government schools. Maharashtra was ranked first in the country.
Compared to other states in mathematics, Maharashtra: In 2018, the number of children in Zilla Parishad schools solving maths in class 5 and above has increased compared to other states since 2014. In Rajasthan, it was 32.2 per cent in 2014 and 34.2 per cent in 2018 (an increase of 2 per cent). In Tamil Nadu, it was 60.3 per cent in 2014 and 62.6 per cent in 2018 (an increase of 2.3 per cent). In Himachal Pradesh, 68.7 per cent children solved mathematics in 2014, which increased to 71.5 per cent in 2018. an increase of 2.8 percent. In Maharashtra, it was 38.6 per cent in 2014, which increased to 59.9 per cent in 2018. Although the number of children in Maharashtra solving mathematics is low, it has increased by 21.3 per cent in 2018 compared to 2014. In other states, it is not so much.
In 2018, 31.7 per cent of Class 5 students in Zilla Parishad schools were able to solve division maths, while the proportion of Class 5 students in private schools was 28.0 per cent. The number of students from private schools has increased in comparison to that of government schools. In India, 22.7 per cent of children in Zilla Parishad schools were able to solve division maths, while the proportion of Class 5 students in private schools was 39.8 per cent.

Other results of the Advanced Education Maharashtra programme highlighted: The ASER reports for 2014, 2016, and 2018 are useful to see the results of the Advanced Education Maharashtra programme. This was not the case in 2014, and by 2018, the program had completed almost four years. The results of these four years are very pleasing.
Government schools lagged behind private schools in this period. Maharashtra is the only state in the country to have more government schools than private schools.
As a result of the Advanced Education Maharashtra programme, the year-on-year dropout rate of government schools increased by 1% (approximately 1,14,000 children) for the first time in 2018. At the same time, the self-financing law reduced the percentage of private schools by 0.7 percent (about 31,500 thousand children), which is constantly increasing.
Maharashtra stood first in the country in the third category of languages among the big states.
Maharashtra is at number one in the country when it comes to government schools.
Maharashtra's 14 per cent increase is the highest in the country when it comes to Class V languages.
The increase in the number of children who could share the fifth grade was 12 percent, which is the highest in the country.
The number of children who can share the eighth grade has increased by 9 percent. After Punjab, Maharashtra is the second-most developed state in the country.
Despite this, a deeper study shows that the state of Kerala ranks first in the country, but only 42.72 percent of the children of class III could read. This means that in three years, 58 percent of children can achieve the first rank even without reading. This is not a good situation if 100 percent of the children are kept in view.
The idea of international level education: This was also predicted in 2015-16. Therefore, it was realized that even after getting the first rank in the country, the work will not be completed as per the Right to Education Act. That's when it was decided to compete with the best education system in the world. As part of this, international schools were planned. Some schools have already started. However, the plan did not take off due to various reasons. However, the concept is currently being implemented as a separate method and name (STARS project). The ultimate goal of this project is to prepare children who will score in PISA.
Education according to the level in Wablewadi International School No international school could be started in the state. Since then, the schools have not been able to function properly. However, W.B. International School, Shirur, G. Pune was successful. What is the basis for the school's success? The students of the school did the following:
Almost all the students of class 5th and 8th pass the scholarship examination.
Children in this school are two grades ahead of their classmates.
Children complete their textbooks in one-third of the academic session.
According to the new education policy, 10 Indian languages are studied as a fun language.
Although the school is Marathi-medium, the children speak English.
Children speak 6.1 foreign languages such as Japanese, Spanish, German, French in the remaining time after completing the course in one-third of the time.
6.2. Foundation Course for preparation of competitive examination.

7.1 Computer Coding, as part of technology education.
7.2 learn to operate a drone 7.3 learn robotics.
There are excellent players in sports.
9) Good in art and culture and learn music.
Of course, these children are ready to learn any subject taught in schools in any country in the world and they have time to learn those subjects.
How did the school happen? It is a Marathi medium, Zilla Parishad rural school in a village of 65 households. In 2012, it was a two-room, two-room school with 32 children in grades 1 through 4. It became a two-room, bicentenary school in 2016, with 225 children in grades 1 to 7. How was it possible that there were only two teachers, 7 classes, 225 children, but the quality was excellent? Datta Warre and Khaire Guruji of that school did not let lack in providing high quality education even with less resources. What did they do for it? This later became a subject of research. Teachers from government schools across the State attended the programme. The school management also visited the spot.
Seeing the quality of the school, various charitable organizations and CSR started visiting. Parents of the children were also worried. They started providing various facilities like laptops, tablets, etc., along with participation in classroom management, sports education, music education. The villagers stopped spending on the fair and provided facilities to the school. The school needed more space. There was no space for it. The villagers donated one acre of land (approximately Rs. 4.00 crore), while Bank of New York with the help of Art of Living donated Rs. 8.00 crore was spent on the construction of school rooms (glass schools).
Research on the success of Wablewadi School: As mentioned earlier, Wablewadi School was visited by a large number of teachers, parents and school management committee members. Seeing the rush of people, the school decided to visit on Saturday. Before the outbreak of Covid, about 2,000 people used to visit every Saturday. After this visit, people thought that they would do the same work in their village school when they returned to their village.
Similarly, members of one of the largest WhatsApp groups of teachers in the state- Ved- also visited the school and wrote about it in detail. The list is available on www. maharashtra. gov. in.
While returning from Wablewadi, after discussing in the bus itself, we decided that we will work in our school in this way. Some of them have already started working. But it didn't seem to go all that far. Then I began to think why such committed, intelligent and talented teachers could not work like Wablewadi. At that time, the Ved Group researched the Wablewadi school.
It showed that the Wablewadi school does the following 17 different things compared to other schools.
Key 17 points 1. Motivate children to learn on their own.
2) Challenging children.
3. Learning Interventions (Peer Learning, Group Learning, Subject Friendly) 4. Respecting the curiosity of children.
# Page 7
Government Resolution No: Vibhasha-2022/ No.44/ Vijabhaj-1
Use of technology in learning.
3) Children's learning speed.
7. Provide an opportunity to learn the syllabus of the next class.
Preparing for various competitive exams.
Process of learning English.
Use the time available due to early completion of the syllabus for extracurricular but life-long learning.
To provide opportunities to learn about future technologies.
Environmental Education- Real life. to make of this.
To provide opportunities to learn other languages of the world and countries.
Partnering with schools in the city and in other countries.
Provide opportunities for children to play sports.
To provide opportunities for learning and expression of music, drama and various arts.
17. Implementing the teaching-learning process by considering multiple intelligences.
It was also noted that all these 17 schools will reach the level of Wablewadi. Some of them were very difficult and some were very expensive. All of these things were impossible. So, despite being a workaholic, committed, intelligent and hardworking, the people in the watch group may not be up to the task.
Analysis using computational thinking arrays: So which of these 17 aspects are less laborious? What can be done at no or low cost? What can be done with the help of teachers and students? What can be done with the help of teachers? What can be done with the help of all the teachers and students of the school together? Are there other things parents can do? Are there other things that can be done if parents are willing to provide financial or material support? Thus the problems and solutions were analyzed piece by piece and step by step. This is known as computer thinking globally. The analysis concluded that it is possible for any teacher in any school to start with six of the 17 items without the help of anyone else. These six aspects are implemented as the six steps of futuristic education. Details will be seen later.
The four stages of development as well as the realization that when you are introducing a new subject in your school, the following four stages can be effectively implemented in a simple way. If you want to complete a big task, you have to divide it into small tasks. It was divided so that the tasks were put in order. The order should be as follows:
A. Self Level:- To start with the work which does not help others. Start your work at your own level so that there is no problem outside. Once you succeed, you can move forward.
B. Self+ Society:- Self is the next level that is completed in the level of society. This is what society needs to do.
Self+ society+ material comfort:- The third stage becomes easier when society comes along. The society decided that more material things are available than expected. This makes the process of completing the difficult task easier.
# Page 8
Government Resolution No: Vibhasha-2022/ No.44/ Vijabhaj-1
D. Self+ society+ material comfort+ administration:- The government comes along with the fulfillment of the above three stages. In fact, it is accompanied at every level, but after completing the above three steps, the administration comes along more effectively.
A successful person thinks in the order of one to four. So, the person who is putting his finger on others thinks in the order of four to one. First the government should decide, then the material facilities should be provided, then the society should come together, then I will work. The above four stages of development have to be taken into account in the same order if a school is to be developed that provides world-class education. In this way, the Ashramshala Warola, which has achieved success by taking the community together, has been established. Details of Majalgaon, G. Beed are at Annexure-I. On the basis of the above principle, the following six points can be made at the self-level.
The six steps of providential education are: 1. Motivate children to learn on their own.
2) Encourage children to learn.
3. Learning intervention (Peer learning, group learning, subject friend) 4. Respecting the inquisitive nature of children.
Use of technology in children's education.
3) Children's learning speed.
After considering the first 4 of the above six steps together, it was known as Self-Determined Learning (Heutagogy) globally. Every child is unique and their learning levels are different. So, this is a more advanced method than the multilevel learning method. Although heutagogy is a learning method globally, it is believed to be applicable to adults (over the age of 18). However, the Wablewadi school has used this method for children above the age of 3. Developed countries like Singapore have also used it at the school level.
After experimenting based on Wablewadi pattern or Heutagogy in government schools, the members of the observation group started working based on Wablewadi pattern in their school. The work started at the public level through the zonal system was through DIET in Washim district. Here, DIET started working with the teachers of the Zilla Parishad School. The schools in Kata in Washim taluka and Marsool in Malegaon taluka saw a tremendous increase in the speed of learning of children through self-education, challenges, peer and group learning. In one school, a fourth-grade student was seen teaching first-grade children division in mathematics.
to create reading material based on it. (Primer Development): Because of the above result, everyone's enthusiasm was increasing. Therefore, it was proposed that this training should also be given in the schools of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation. The assistant commissioner of the school, Mr. Salil Bhapre, approved it and demanded the teacher's handbook. The booklet was prepared by Dr. Sangolkar (Senior Advocate) and Nilesh Ghuge (then Subject Assistant and presently State Training Coordinator, Other Backward Bahujan Welfare Department). After this, the teachers of Mumbai Municipal Corporation were given training on a large scale. After some time, the Covid-19 outbreak increased and the physical training stopped. But for the teachers in the Vedha group, the lockdown due to Covid turned out to be a great opportunity. During this period, online training started on Zoom for 6 days of 2 hours per day
# Page 9
Government Resolution No: Vibhasha-2022/ No.44/ Vijabhaj-1
This has made it possible to train teachers of other states across the country on a large scale. Teachers from Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, etc. were trained through this.
Training in Tribal Projects Nandurbar and Dahanu and Outcome: During the lockdown period, training was imparted to the teachers of ITDP, Nandurbar and ITDP, Dahanu in a blended online and offline mode. Of these, the Nandurbar project conducted all kinds of tests, including baseline, midline and endline. He trained the 5th grade teachers of all the schools in the project. The Dahanu project selected and trained teachers who did good work. Both projects turned out great. Teachers and students are working in a creative way. Every day there's something new. In Nandurbar project, despite only 56 days of schooling in 4 months from December 2021 to March 2022, almost 100% children have been successful in moving beyond the primary level towards FLN. The progress of the project is shown in Appendix II.
The Dahanu project developed an app for evaluation. By filling in the information, teachers were able to identify each child's level of learning and thus the level at which each child should be taught. She was learning faster by teaching the children according to the level. The teacher was happy.
Also, when the children returned to school after the summer vacation in June, 2022, the teachers noticed that the children had learned more during the vacation than they had before the vacation.
Training in Nagpur Zilla Parishad and Tribal Commissioner, Nagpur Division Nagpur Zilla Parishad also trained selected good teachers. He was a very good teacher. The teachers and officials of the tribal department of the Nagpur division who went to see his school were overwhelmed. He trained the teachers of all the tribal ashramshalas in Nagpur division under the leadership of Additional Tribal Commissioner, Shri Ravindra Thakare. On the last day of the training, all these teachers talked about the training in detail.
Ashramshalas in Other Backward Bahujan Welfare Department: Google Forms of the schools of the department have been filled and the institution directors, headmasters and teachers of the best schools have been selected. A one-day workshop of a good institution manager, president or secretary was held in the ministry. In this too, the energy of the drivers of the institution was visible at the end of the workshop. His mother Minister (I) noted.
When the ministry officials visited some schools (not selected) in the division, they found that almost all the children had watched YouTube videos. Have you ever heard of the word" America"? The incident took place in Gadag district of Karnataka. At the Gurdial Singh Ashram, many children raised their hands when asked. Three of them called the children to the stage and said:" Where did you hear that? " When the question was asked, everyone had seen the video on YouTube and got to know about America. When asked what he saw in the video, 1. a boy remembered that he was the highest millionaire in the country.
The second child remembered the big buildings and English education there.
The third child remembered the English-speaking people there.
When asked who saw the video on their mobile phones, the answers came from mother, father, sister, brother, etc.

Parental involvement: Parents of children studying in Vijabhaj Ashramshala are involved in the issue of potable water. Many parents work as sugarcane harvesters, while the parents of the Dombari community literally work as carpenters. Many more people from the nomadic community live on the foothills. As a residential school, children can be admitted to hostels and schools wherever their parents are. However, 100% of the children are still not enrolled in school.
Some of the social service providers work as surgeons and send their children to school. However, not all parents want to send their children to school. After the discussion, at some point, even if it is ready, once again it becomes difficult to solve the problem of stomach-water, then they come to school every day to take the child back.
During a visit to a school in Pune, it was told that 80 percent of the children of the Dombari community are able to be admitted there, but since more than the sanctioned number of children cannot be admitted in that school, about 400 children go back every year. There are also some schools in the state where the sanctioned number comes to nine.
In Aurangabad, where there is no hostel facility, a mother with a child. Devendra Fadnavis was the Chief Minister of Maharashtra then.
The following dialogue of the Deputy Prime Minister is understandable.
Mr. Chief Minister: Is it true that you people used to take children with you while plucking sugarcane earlier, but now you have to arrange something for them in the village itself?
Sugarcane worker parent: Yes sir, it is true. Earlier, when the quality of the school was low, it was thought that the children would become sugarcane workers even after studying in the school. Then it was necessary to give them the experience of breaking sugarcane. But after the arrival of Mr. Bharat Kale Guruji, the face and quality of the school has changed a lot. Now I think our children can do something different when they learn. We also don't like the life of a worker. For the bright future of our children, we keep them with relatives and go for sugarcane harvesting. It is our compulsion. We don't want our children to have that. The quality of education in the school is the only way to get parents' participation. All teachers, principals and students are invited to attend. Parents of non-resident children immediately begin to notice changes in the quality of schooling. However, the parents of the students are not aware of this. There is a perception that parents of residential students are scattered in villages away from the school. Still, the new in the school began to develop some unique and, most importantly, qualitative qualities, which parents need to be informed about in different ways. Parents meetings can be held via Zoom, parents' WhatsApp groups, and the school's YouTube channel. It is being brought to everyone's attention that the visible effect of quality enhancement to parents is that the children speak English and the children pass the scholarship exam. All school principals and teachers should be able to achieve this level of success, only then it will be possible to educate 100% of the state's students. Otherwise, the situation of vacant seats in schools and children out of school cannot be ruled out.
Need to teach Spoken English: The conclusion of all this is that children are watching their favorite videos from mobile. Also, their preference seems to be richness, English and modern age. It is our responsibility to our school
# Page 11
Government Resolution No: Vibhasha-2022/ No.44/ Vijabhaj-1
Children should be educated so that they can lead a happy and prosperous life. They also need to learn to speak English.
Other backward Bahujan welfare departments are also moving in the same direction. That is why last year, every child of 9th to 12th class has been provided with one tablet in this quantity. This year, one tablet will be given to every five children of classes 6 to 8. Though the government has provided free tablets, it is the responsibility of the institution owners, principals, teachers, parents and society to make proper use of them. These tablets will need internet access to study YouTube videos as well as from Google. Our children live in the hostel. So they have the opportunity to learn more through tablets. Senior officials of the government will personally visit the first 25 schools to congratulate them for imparting such education. So far, 3 such ashramshalas have been established by the Additional Chief Secretary (EMBQV), Director, Directorate of Other Backward Bahujan Welfare, Pune and Deputy Secretary (EC). M.B.K.V. has visited Teachers and parents are also being trained.
All schools and teachers are connected through What's App Groups. Zoom meetings of the teachers and principals of the department have been started to take care of the learning of the children.
Attending and passing the scholarship examination. The students of Shirur, G. Pune Ashramshala are appearing in the scholarship examination from the last 2016-17. The most recent result there is 62 percent of the total vote. (See Appendix 6) Our goal is that the school reaches 100 percent today or tomorrow. Children of some other ashramshalas of the state will also appear in the scholarship examination. But according to one school of thought, the children of the ashram school will not pass the scholarship exam. In the future, we have to reverse this trend and reach a point where 100 per cent of the children in the ashramshala appear in the scholarship examination and pass.
Assessment of Educational Quality- As mentioned in the introduction, each child in the special schools will be assessed at three levels with a certain frequency. Also, its data will be filled in a specially designed app every time.
FLN Level Assessment: It is also known as Impact Assessment (ASER) Level Assessment. However, there are some differences between ASER and FLN. The expected result of FLN is that children of class II are expected to read 45 words per minute while children of class III are expected to read 60 words per minute. This is called reading speed. There was no reading speed. Similarly, a new aspect" reading culture" has entered into the language education of FLN. The criteria for assessment of reading culture have been decided after long and in-depth discussions with experienced teachers. If children are reading a large number of books, it means that they understand the text they read. Also, no one will read more than they enjoy reading. So, it is only fair to interpret that children who read more books/ texts have developed a reading culture. According to this argument, reading 200 small books by second grade children and 300 small books by third grade children can be said to have developed a reading culture. In this way, the criteria for evaluating reading culture have been determined.
Thus, the language assessment of FLN will be sufficient if the expected factors for assessment of FLN are added to the impact of initial level, letter reading, word reading, sentence reading, paragraph reading as well as reading rate and reading culture. All children in all grades in Vijabhaj schools are to be assessed every 15 days on the basis of these criteria. The details of both language and mathematics assessment are given in Annexure-III.

The information to be prepared in this way is to be filled in the app, the link to which will be made available later. The task of filling the information should be done by the PISA level children in the class. This will enhance their computer skills and data handling skills. This will also save the time of the students.
Every school must have at least 300 books available for reading culture. I hope there are more books available at school. Books are of a particular kind. They have fewer leaves. The paws are large. The proportion of pictures and printed words is between 80% and 20%.
Children should be encouraged to read these books. Later, bigger books should be given. Books should be made available in schools.
A library can be arranged in the hostel as Vijabhaj School is residential. Books can also be found in the library. The list of online books should be made available to the children so that non-resident students can also get the facility of reading books in addition to school time.
At present, 249 online books have been received by the Department and these books are available in the" e-library" under the heading" e-Nagrik" on the website www. obcbahujankalyan. maharashtra. gov. in. The department is trying to get more books online. A list of 500 such books will be made available later. Books should be made available to students. The Department is making efforts to make PDFs of the above books available in online format so that children can read the books till the books are made available in schools and at least 300 books are available online.
The Learning Navigator will be used to assess the NAS and PISA levels of each child in special schools.

Books in English, Math, and Science will also be available.

The government will felicitate the best 200 schools in the state for providing facilities for evaluation.
Training on demand: State Governments are conducting initial MOLIC, MOLIS and MOLIH training on their own.
Apart from this, some training has been given in the field of food safety and some training related to it is currently going on.
In the future, training may be required in spoken English and scholarship test success. Children need to be taught life skills. Similarly, some teachers have suggested the need for training in Marathi language teaching, mathematics education, and English education.
