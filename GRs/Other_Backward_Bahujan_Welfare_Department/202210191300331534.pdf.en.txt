Date: October 11, 2022
Reference:- 1.Sasan Decision No.Shivriti 2018/ Q. No. 1118/ Education, dated 11/10/2018 2. Govt. Corrigendum SHIWRITI2019/ PR. 96/ Education, dated 01/02/2020 Preamble: In order to ensure that meritorious students belonging to Other Backward Classes, Denotified Castes and Nomadic Tribes, and Special Backward Classes are not deprived of higher education in reputed educational institutions abroad, the Hon. Cabinet of Ministers As per the decision taken in the meeting on 21/08/2018, the Government has decided to grant foreign scholarship every year to 10 meritorious students in the category of VJBJ, EMV and VIMAPRA for higher education abroad. Issued on 11/10/2018. A total of 10 scholarships are awarded annually.
Due to various reasons such as poor financial condition of students, parents not having movable and immovable property, lack of credit in the market, parents being farmers and farm labourers and semi-literates, banks do not provide loans to students belonging to Other Backward Classes, Denotified Castes and Nomadic Tribes, and Insured Castes for higher education abroad. Because the bank demands a solid guarantee from the students.
As a result, the poor students of this category are deprived of opportunities for higher education, technology and research in foreign countries despite having qualifications, competencies and abilities. Considering the proportion of the population belonging to the Vimukta Jati and Nomadic Tribes, Other Backward Classes and Special Backward Classes in Maharashtra, it has been decided to increase the number of students from 10 to 50 under the scholarship scheme for meritorious children for higher education abroad. Cabinet of Ministers was held on 27.9.2022.
Accordingly, the number of meritorious students under the scholarship scheme for higher education abroad was under consideration to be increased from 10 to 50.
Government's decision:
The Government is approving to increase the number of students under the Scholarship Scheme for Higher Education abroad from 10 to 50 from the year 2022-23 for meritorious children belonging to Other Backward Classes, Vimukt Jati, Nomadic Tribes and Special Backward Classes as follows:
