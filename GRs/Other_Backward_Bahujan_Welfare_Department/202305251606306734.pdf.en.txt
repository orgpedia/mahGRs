Preamble: GOVERNMENT DECISION The General Administration Department (IT), dated 12.10.2018, has implemented a single State level system of Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) for distribution of benefits, financial assistance and services provided by various departments of the Government to the intended and eligible beneficiaries. Other Backward Bahujan Welfare Department is implementing Pre-Matric and Post-Matric Scholarship Schemes for students belonging to Other Backward Classes, Vimukta Jati, Nomadic Tribes and Special Backward Classes. As per the decision of the Department dated 26.10.2017, the State level DBT system will be used for all the processes from applying for scholarship schemes to depositing the benefit of the scheme in the Aadhaar linked bank account of the beneficiary student.
Use is mandatory. The benefit of post-matric scholarship schemes is provided directly to the students through the MahaDBT portal.
Although the post-matric scholarship scheme is being implemented through the MahaDBT system since 2018-19, due to various difficulties in applying on the portal, many students are facing many problems such as not being able to fill the application within the prescribed time, the application is auto-rejected, if the application is not filled in a year, the gap year is mentioned on the portal and the next year's application is difficult to fill. In view of all these difficulties, the Department of Information and Technology has given feedback that it is capable of taking decisions in the case of students who have faced such difficulties from the year 2018-19 to 2021-22. Accordingly, the students belonging to Vimukt Jati, Nomadic Tribes, Other Backward Classes and Special Backward Classes will be covered under the scholarship/ friship scheme for the period 2018-19 to 2021-22.
