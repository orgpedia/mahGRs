The Proposal: -
For the past many years, there has been a demand from the people's representatives, various organizations to form a separate corporation for the social development of the weavers community. The weavers community and their various tribes, which are included in the Other Backward Classes as well as Special Backward Classes in the state, are mainly economically and socially backward. Reference No. 1 to the formation of a separate corporation, "Weaver Society Economic Development Corporation," to provide the youth of the Weaver community residing in all the districts of the state with the benefit of various schemes on the lines of Vasantrao Naik Vimukt Jati B Nomadic Tribes Development Corporation and Maharashtra State Other Backward Classes Finance and Development Corporation for the overall development of the Weaver community and to strive for economic upliftment. 1 was approved by the Government Decision dated 16.03.2024.
The Weaver community belongs to the Other Backward Classes as well as the Special Backward Classes. Earlier, the community units of Ramoshi / Bedar, Vadar, Lohar and Gawli were covered by the Rajee Umaji Naik Economic Development Corporation, Wrestler's Club, respectively. The Maruti Chavan-Wadar Economic Development Corporation, the Brahmalin Acharya Divyanand Puriji Maharaj Economic Development Corporation, and the Shrikrishna Adhuri Vikas Corporation are subsidiaries established under the AMAT Naik Vimukt Jati B Nomadic Tribes Development Corporation.

Accordingly, the matter of setting up a subsidiary "Weavers Community Economic Development Corporation" under the Vasantrao Naik Vimukt Caste and Nomadic Tribes Development Corporation was under consideration.
