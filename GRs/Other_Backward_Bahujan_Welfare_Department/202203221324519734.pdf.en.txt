As of March 22, 2022
Reference:- Government Resolution, Other Backward Bahujan Welfare Department, No.Asthapra-2017/ PR No. 08/ Establishment-2, dated 14/01/2021
Preamble: The revised pattern of posts on establishment of Regional Offices of the Department has been approved under Government Resolution, Other Backward Bahujan Welfare Department, dated 14/1/2021. At present, the work of this department is being done at the regional level by the Regional Deputy Commissioner, Social Welfare and at the district level- by the Assistant Commissioner, Social Welfare. Also, the sanctioned posts in the office of Director, Other Backward Bahujan Welfare Directorate, Maharashtra State, Pune are currently being filled by deputation through the Department of Social Justice and Special Assistance. It is proposed to start the regional level offices of the Other Backward Bahujan Welfare Department immediately on the lines of the regional level office structure of the Social Justice Department. Accordingly, it is likely to take some time for regular postings to be made after the service entry rules are published. Similarly, the duties and responsibilities and pay scales of the posts in the sanctioned cadre at the zonal level of the Department of Social Justice and Special Assistance are the same as the posts in the sanctioned cadre at the zonal level of this Department. In view of this, it was under consideration of the Government to apply the Service Entry Rules applicable to certain cadre posts at the zonal level of the Department of Social Justice and Special Assistance to the equivalent cadre posts of the Department.
Government Decisions The Service Entry Rules applicable to the posts in the field level cadre of the Department of Social Justice and Special Assistance are being applied to the posts in the following cadre equivalent to this Department
