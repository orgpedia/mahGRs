2. Ma. Decision of the Council of Ministers dated 30.09.2024.
Introduction: Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Research and Training Institute (BARTI), Pune has undertaken a number of initiatives for the Scheduled Castes in a big way. This has contributed greatly to the development of the youth of the Scheduled Castes through many means. The Sarathi and Mahajyoti Sanstha has been established on the lines of this Sanstha.
The meeting was chaired by the Chief Minister. On 07.02.2023, a meeting of the Gor Banjara Jama'ati was held on the topic of major issues. In these meetings, Shri. The Chief Minister immediately proposed to set up a "Vasantrao Naik Research and Training Centre (VANARTY)" in Mumbai on the lines of Barty. Instructions have been given to present it before the cabinet. Accordingly, on the date 30.09.2024, Ma. The cabinet has approved the formation of the "One Party" organization.
The Gor Banjara community is scattered throughout India, with independent settlements as far as the extreme corners of India. The society appears to have drifted away from the mainstream as the constitutionally scheduled gor banjara community did not find a place in the post-independence period in the state of Maharashtra. The Gor Banjara community is steeped in backwardness. Also, the social issues of Vimukt Jati-A, Vimukt Jati-B, Vimukt Jati-C and Vimukt Jati-D are very complex. Therefore, it is under the consideration of the Government to set up an autonomous institute "Vasantrao Naik Research and Training Institute (VANARTY)" to carry out research and studies mainly in line with the social, educational and economic development of these elements including the Gor Banjara tribe and to carry out various activities for their social, educational and economic development for students, youth, etc. and to carry out various programmes for them through other means.
The Government's Decisions:
1) As efforts are required for the socio-economic and educational development of the backward tribe of Gor Banjara, under Rule 8 of the Companies Act, 2013, to carry out various programmes / activities for the students, youth and other candidates belonging to the B component, mainly for research and development of this tribe and to give due attention to their social, economic and educational development.
