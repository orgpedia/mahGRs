Mgraro-2022// Q. No.174/ Rohyo-6A dated 14th December, 2022.
Introduction: Many castes and tribes, which fall under the category of nomadic tribes in the state, are still living as nomadic migrants. The Laman, Banjara, nomadic tribes belonging to the Vimukt caste category, Dhangar community have tandas/ wadis/ hamlets in the rural areas. Although the people of this caste/ tribe have been living in the tandas for many years, such tandas or hamlets do not have access to basic facilities and are inclined towards modernity, even today the majority of the society is living in poverty. For this, it is very important to provide facilities to the nomadic tribal community living in tandas, wadis or hamlets to lead a stable life.
The decline in traditional occupations of the denotified nomadic and semi-nomadic communities has further exacerbated their poverty. The focus needs to be on supporting the creation of livelihoods for these communities. The population of Denotified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (DNT/ NT/ SNT) is one of the poorest and most vulnerable in most parts of the country. These communities will have a more stable lifestyle of modern livelihood and their willingness to build institutions will enhance their ability to avail of government schemes and, more importantly, help in their ability to continue education without interruption.
The state has made great progress in the last decade in the matter of the denotified and nomadic castes. A large number of ashramshalas have been opened for the education of the children of this community. Both resident and non-resident students. Not all children belonging to Other Backward Classes, Vimukt Jati, Nomadic Tribes and Special Backward Classes are able to get admission in residential schools. A large number of people belonging to Other Backward Classes, Denotified Castes and Nomadic Tribes and Special Backward Classes are still nomadic due to lack of livelihood. The settled families are also busy in earning their livelihood and involve their children in it. If families are nomadic, the continuity of their education is not possible without the children getting admission in residential hostels.
Children of settled families were enrolled in Zilla Parishad schools or non-residential schools

However, their education will be disrupted due to the lack of livelihood of their parents. There is also a plan to provide houses in the Yashwantrao Chavan free colony. This allows families to live in the same house.
However, since this does not include providing a means of livelihood, their wanderings are inevitable, and therefore the education of the children may be interrupted. Therefore, in view of all the above, there is a need to provide permanent means of livelihood to all the nomadic families.
The department implements various schemes for Other Backward Classes, Vimukt Jati, Nomadic Tribes and Special Backward Classes. Their details are given below:
1) Vasantrao Naik Tanda/ Vasti Sudhar Yojana The Vasantrao Naik Tanda/ Vasti Sudhar Yojana has been launched for the betterment of the nomadic community in the state. The works to be taken up under the scheme include 1) Electrification, 2) Drinking Water, 3) Internal Roads, 4) Sewers, 5) Toilets and Community Temples/ Libraries and wherever possible, roads connecting to the main road.
Funds are provided to implement Vasantrao Naik Tanda/ Habitat Improvement Scheme in proportion to the population. The funds being released at present are insufficient/ inadequate/ inadequate for the overall development of the Tandas/ Bastis/ Wadis in terms of providing full amenities. Due to the limitations of the works to be undertaken under this scheme, the overall development of the villages/ tandas and hamlets of the deprived castes and nomadic tribes cannot be achieved. Therefore, there is no overall development of tendons at the same time or over a period of time. Therefore, if the works taken up under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme run by the Planning Department are combined with the works taken up under the Vasantrao Naik Tanda Habitat Improvement Scheme, then the overall development of the villages/ tandas and hamlets of the deprived castes and nomadic tribes can be achieved.
2) Yashwantrao Chavan Free Settlement Scheme for the Vimukta Jati and Nomadic Tribes and Ahilyabai Gharkul Scheme for the Dhangar Community
The process of convergence for Open Settlement/ Individual Household Scheme will be as follows: Open Settlement/ Individual Household Scheme is implemented for the homeless persons belonging to the category of Vimukta Jati Nomadic Tribes in the State. Under this scheme, houses with an area of 269 sq.ft. are constructed by providing 5 guntas of land each to below poverty line and homeless families in rural areas. In the rest of the places, the beneficiaries are provided with opportunities for self-employment through various government schemes. A total of 20 families will be settled on one hectare of land. Under the scheme, Rs. Rs 88.62 crore has been allocated for this. If land is available for a total of 10 eligible beneficiaries, they will also be given the collective benefit of this scheme. The scheme is also applicable to individual beneficiaries.

Accordingly, Rs. 1.30 lakh and Rs. A sum of Rs. 1.20 lakh had been sanctioned. Under this scheme, funds can be provided under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme for the development of habitations for the benefits of providing civic amenities such as water supply, electricity supply, internal roads with safety tank gutters etc. to the colony while establishing the colony and providing opportunities for self-employment for individual benefits.

The total population of VJNT in the state is around 30 lakh.
The remaining students are studying in Zilla Parishad schools and other aided schools. However, the possibility of some children being irregular or out of school cannot be ruled out. If the necessary works in the ashramshala and the surrounding areas are taken from the MNREGA scheme, it will help in the physical development and beautification of the ashramshalas in the state and make the area beautiful.
6) Under the above decision of the Government dated 22nd August, 2019, a new autonomous institution named Academy of Maharashtra Research, Upliftment and Tarining (AMRUT) has been approved to be set up for the development of students, youth, etc. by implementing other activities and programs for youth and other candidates from economically weaker sections of the open category. This will facilitate the creation of content, training and facilitation.

This will facilitate the creation of content, training and facilitation.
In the above context, the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme and the convergence of the schemes of this Department with the' Suvidha Sampoorna Kutumbi Mission and the Sarvottam Gram Samriddhi Yojana' are to be implemented.
The following steps will be taken to implement the plan:

All of these are aimed at increasing the income of the family. This should be clear to everyone.
MNREGA is publishing a book on the success story of MNREGA. It has brought clarity to the impact of each of the above on the income of the people. to study any of it
It should be studied how much the income will increase if the family is given any work under MNREGA.
The stage of the facility that is to be achieved according to the current situation of that family should be matched by the planned work of MNREGA so that that family can reach that stage. It is our goal that through the planning of works and their speedy and quality implementation, the family should reach the desired level of convenience. Every family needs to be educated. For this, a separate note should be prepared on the economics of each work.
Goat rearing has been the traditional occupation of the VJNT community, which is the community component of the Department of Medical Thought on Sheep Husbandry. Therefore, it is necessary to pay special attention to this issue.
Dated February 4, 2021. The government has taken a decision regarding Sharad Pawar Gram Samriddhi Yojana under MNREGA. Under this government decision, the goal is to make 3 units of goat rearing shed goats permissible to each beneficiary, to make every family in the state prosperous (Lakhpati) by producing this and other such products. This is a challenging task and requires the cooperation of all sections of the state.
While MNREGA will provide sheds for goat rearing, the Animal Husbandry Department is expected to provide goat groups under its scheme. However, the situation is different in Palghar district. Goats in MGNREGA
Page 15 of 6
# Page 7
Government Decision Number: Scheme-2022/ S.No.80/ Scheme-1 There is no limit of fund for construction of rearing shed. People need to ask. They're job card holders.
A family should be paid wages within 100 days of the year and the ratio of unskilled to skilled should be 60:40. Similarly, in the last financial year, 600 goat rearing sheds were constructed in Vikramgad taluka, out of which 60 sheds were constructed in Khomarpada village alone. However, the Animal Husbandry Department has said that in the last financial years, the area of Palghar district was 70 goat groups, so it is not possible to give goat groups to all the families who demand goat sheds.
The good news is that there are other solutions. The main issue in goat rearing is not to buy goats but to take care of them. The most important thing in goat rearing is not to let the goats get sick. Hygiene plays an important role in reducing disease. The most important thing is to maintain the cleanliness of the sheepskin shed. After a family gets a shed, the next task is to (i) maintain hygiene, (ii) vaccinate the goats to prevent other diseases, (ii) timely veterinary help if the goat falls and despite all this, (iv) insurance to compensate for the loss of a goat.
If any family is able to do these 4 things, then that person can become a millionaire by starting with 1, 2, 3 or even 4 goats. How to do all the above and how to raise goats in a scientific way requires training and follow-up of each family. There are some voluntary organizations that do this. But, the responsibility of this work is expected to be taken by the Other Backward Bahujan Welfare Department.
There is also a view that the manpower required for rearing a herd of 50 goats is economically unaffordable considering the fact that the MNREGA department has decided to allow 50 goats for each job card. However, starting with one goat and assuming a mortality rate of 30 percent, it can reach 17 goats in three and a half years. (See Appendix 1). Therefore, by building the capacity of rearing by providing goat rearing sheds in a family, a group of 50 goats can be formed in three and a half years starting from 3 goats. As an example of this, the success story of Shri Bagate is given in Annexure 2.
In the goat group allocation, considering the financial limitations of the families, it is being encouraged to take action as above.
However, if one wants to start with more than 2-4 goats without waiting for the group allocation from the government, they should take the help of Goat Bank of Karkheda.
The Bank of Caracas.
If a family does not have even three goats as mentioned above, they can take goats from the Goat Bank of Karkheda. At present, the bank provides 1 goat for Rs 1100/-. After that, the bank has to return 4 chicks for each goat in the next 3 years. Here too, if properly nurtured, families can borrow goats from banks, repay in the form of chicks, and become millionaires.

GOVERNMENT DECISION NO.: SCHEME-2022/ PR. NO. 80/ SCHEME-1 The Other Backward Bahujan Welfare Department is expected to take initiative to improve the living standards of the Other Backward Classes, Vimukta Jati and Nomadic Tribes and Special Backward Classes families by converging the schemes of the two departments namely Other Backward Bahujan Welfare Department and Planning (ROHYO). Considering all these factors, the government has taken the following decisions:
Government's decision
Part I: Providing facilities to the families belonging to Other Backward Classes, Vimukt Jati and Nomadic Tribes and Special Backward Classes.
As per the revised vision of MGNREGA, the families belonging to Other Backward Classes, Vimukt Jati and Nomadic Tribes and Special Backward Classes in the State are being notified to create facilities phase 1 to 4.
For this, the list of MAM (Moderately Acute Malnutrition) malnourished children in the villages, wadis, other backward classes in Wanda, Vimukta Jati and nomadic tribes and special backward class families should be obtained from the Deputy Chief Executive Officer, Officer Women and Child Development, as well as the list of children of Other Backward Classes, Vimukta Jati and Nomadic Tribes and Special Backward Classes in the school who are irregular. Children who are absent from school for more than five consecutive days or more than one month in a year.
In addition, a list of children in the age group of 0 to 14 years from families who do not live in any villages, wadis, hamlets, tandas but are living in a palanquin somewhere in the district should be made with the help of Anganwadi workers and teachers of the concerned place. Such children should be sent to schools and anganwadis.
The activities of MGNREGA should be planned for the parents of all the children in the list received in point number 2 and 3 above for the purpose of facilitating them in phase 1 and 2. It should be ensured that the work of MGNREGA is continued till each of these families has access to healthy, balanced, diverse, tasty, abundant food, cooking gas, cooker, mixer, smartphone. For this, the priorities of public, collective and individual work given in the preamble should be followed, 5. In order to increase the income of the families after giving the benefit to the beneficiary, appropriate training should be provided from the schemes and funds of OBC, VJNT corporations, Mahajyoti and AMRUT.
Part II: Implementation of the Comprehensive Village Development Scheme for Other Backward Classes, Denotified Castes and Nomadic Tribes and Special Backward Classes.
The Other Backward Bahujan Welfare Department has already prepared a plan for the development of Wadi/ Tanda of Vimukt G and nomadic tribes. However, it did not include individual benefit plans. In the future, this category of wadis/ hamlets will be planned along with public works.
Page 8 of 15
# Page 9
Government Resolution No: Scheme-2022/ PR No.80/ Scheme-1
Individual as well as group activities (Self Help Groups Farmers Clubs/ Companies etc.) are also to be planned.
Initially, 20 wards are to be selected this year. 2.1 Select 20 villages in one or two taluks of the district having the maximum population of the denotified and nomadic communities.
2.2 It has a population of more than 2.2.1,500 of denotified and nomadic tribes
2.2.2. from 250 to 500
2.2.3. from 100 to 250
2.2.4. less than 100
5 villages will be selected. However, the above criteria will not be applicable while selecting a village adjacent to each other.
2.3 Electrification, drinking water, internal roads, sewers, toilets and community temples/ libraries at Tanda/ Vasti as per requirement and wherever feasible, connecting roads to the main road. Also, to take up works which can be taken up for the overall development of the Tanda habitations (including beautification of Ashramshalas by undertaking 13 types of works) out of the works to be taken up for the development of rural areas under the Employment Guarantee Scheme.
2.4 100% of the households in the selected villages should be planned in this way. However, the officers of the Other Backward Bahujan Welfare Department will work only for the families of Other Backward Classes, Vimukt Jati and Nomadic Tribes and Special Backward Classes while the Block Development Officers will implement for the remaining families.
3. Individual schemes In selected wards and hamlets, in addition to the above schemes, the families of these institutions who have land. The Assistant Director/ Commissioner and the Deputy Collector (ROHO) concerned should prepare a plan as to which of the schemes of MNREGA such as individual well, farm, orchard, flower cultivation, etc. can be given to them.
4. Group Schemes Most of the families belonging to Other Backward Classes, Denotified Castes and Nomadic Tribes and Special Backward Classes do not have access to their own land. In such a situation, their self-help groups, producer companies should be formed and a collective plan should be implemented by making land available to them. If there is a gairan, gaon or government land available, a collective mutt should be built on such a place. If government land is not available, the group or company should buy the land or provide the land on a 30-year lease. In that place, buttermilk will be produced through MGNREGA.

Government Decision No. Scheme-2022/ PR No. 80/ Scheme-1 5. Under the Public Scheme Employment Guarantee Scheme, the works to be taken up for the development of rural areas (including beautification of Ashram Schools by undertaking 13 types of works) may be taken up for the overall development of Tanda habitations. Further, under the scheme of Other Backward Bahujan Welfare Department, electrification, drinking water, internal roads, sewers, toilets and roads connecting Samaj Mandir/ library and main road wherever possible should be taken up at Tanda/ Vasti as per requirement.
6 The Other Backward Classes, Denotified Castes and Nomadic Tribes and Special Backward Classes should prepare a mutual complementary scheme for the cow-calf/ poultry sheds and NADEP vermi-compost income generating units to be set up under MGNREGS in the Wadi/ Tanda. Other Backward Classes (OBC), VJNT Corporations, Mahajyoti and AMRUT will participate in the campaign.
6. Activities to be carried out by Ashramshalas: The headmasters, teachers and heads of institutions should enhance the physical facilities and beautification of their school by using the 13 facilities of MNREGA. Here it is necessary to keep in mind that while working under MNREGA, these works should be in the ratio of 60:40 unskilled: skilled. If only the ashramshala takes these 13 works, it will be difficult to fit them in the ratio of 60:40. If there is ample space in the yard, it is possible to grow a certain amount of inefficiently by planting more trees.
However, the schools should motivate the parents of the children to take up unskilled allied activities in their fields such as orchards, floriculture, sericulture, tree plantation, tree plantation on bunds, wells, farmlands, nadap/ vermi compost.
This will strengthen the parents and strengthen the livelihood of their children. Also, funds will be made available for the school.
The schools should also motivate the parents of the children to do the work of MNREGA so that the parents of the children have a smartphone and the data pack is always available in it and they should get the work done through the Assistant Director, Other Backward Bahujan Welfare Directorate, Maharashtra State, Pune. Parents should also use their smartphones to ensure that the quality of education of their children remains high.
The children live in the hostel. They don't use mobile phones. All children in grades 9-12 are provided one tablet per 5 children in grades 5-8. The scheme is also being implemented for students of classes 1 to 5. The government has not provided tablets to every child up to class 8 due to lack of funds. It is a welcome thing for every child to have their own tablet. For this, schools for residential children should motivate parents to provide individual tablets for their wards. If the income of such parents is low, they should be provided work under MNREGA. In this way, schools have to make the schools attractive by using MNREGA. Also, quality education should be provided.
