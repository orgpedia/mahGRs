Introduction: - Residential Ashramshalas are run by this department on a 100% subsidized basis for children belonging to the Visva-Bharj category. Some of these primary ashramshalas were upgraded to secondary ashramshalas, while some secondary schools were upgraded to residential higher secondary ashramshalas over time. At present, about 977 primary, secondary and higher secondary ashramshalas are functioning under the department. The Ashramshalas run by NGOs are doing a commendable job in ensuring the economic, social and educational progress of the students. Free accommodation, food, health facilities, sports facilities, educational materials, toiletries, dining utensils, etc. are being provided by the Ashramshala to the boys and girls of the Visva-Bharj category with education from classes 1 to 12.
For this, the government provides non-salaried grants to the relevant agencies.
The visibility of the traditional writing board Green Writing Board (5151011199) in the Ashramshala of the Visible Category is higher than that of the traditional writing board, so the written text is very clear to the students from the first to the last column of the class. Since green boards are durable and strong, they do not require maintenance costs. Also, the equipment in the mathematical drawing writing tool box is useful for mathematics, geometric calculations, arts, crafts, architectural designing, and other engineering purposes.
