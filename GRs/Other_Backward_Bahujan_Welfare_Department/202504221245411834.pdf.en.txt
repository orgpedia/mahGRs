Introduction: - On the lines of the Tribal Development Department's "Designated Wear Scheme," a decision has been taken to provide education to the students of the Dhangar community belonging to the nomadic tribe-C category in the reputed residential schools of English medium in the city. The governance of the 4.9.2019 is governed by the Decision. Accordingly, a District Level Committee under the Chairmanship of the Collector has been constituted to scrutinize the proposals of the schools received under the scheme under the district and forward the proposal to the Director, Directorate of Other Backward Classes Bahujan Welfare, Pune with a self-explanatory recommendation.
However, in view of the additional workload on the part of the Collector in the wake of COVID, as well as the fact that the Collector is the head of several Committees, he is free to do so. As per the circular of the 9/12/2020, a Scrutiny Committee was constituted under the chairmanship of the Collector and a Scrutiny Committee under the chairmanship of the Director, Directorate of Other Backward Classes, Multipurpose Welfare, M.R., Pune. However, the criteria for the scheme include the Government Decision, d. As additional criteria have been included under the 5/3/2024 and the scrutiny of compliance of these additional criteria requires the inclusion of the concerned officers as "members" in the Director level committee, the matter of reforming the composition of the committee was under consideration of the Government, as well as the omission of the word "TEMA" in the "Dhangar Named School" scheme on the same lines as the word "City" was omitted in the Government Decision dated 18.5.2018 in the context of the Tribal Development Department.
Government Decision: - On the lines of the Government Decision dated 18.5.2018 under the context of Tribal Development Department, the Government is approving deletion of the word "City" in the scheme "To provide education to students of Dhangar community belonging to nomadic tribe-C category in reputed residential schools of English medium in the city."
