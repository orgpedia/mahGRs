Government offices were closed since March, 2020 in the wake of COVID-19 (Corona). As a result, candidates appearing for the Maharashtra Public Service Commission (MPSC) examinations have not been able to get non-criminal certificates. In this background, the following orders are being passed in respect of non-criminal certificates.
(9) As the candidates have not withdrawn the non-creamy layer certificate due to the outbreak of Corona, the non-creamy layer certificate of the year 2019-2020, 2020-2021 should be accepted without demanding the non-creamy layer certificate of the year 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 during the interview with the Maharashtra Public Service Commission.
(2) Candidates who have been excluded from the interview process on the grounds of non-criminal certification shall be given an opportunity to be interviewed.
(3) There are existing rules regarding the submission of non-criminal certificate assuming the income of the previous year before the pre-examination. There is no change in this government circular regarding the candidates who have submitted the previous year's non-criminal certificate in this way.
However, the candidates who could not produce the Non-Crimilary Certificate due to the outbreak of Corona disease before the Pre-Main or Main Written Examination, but have not produced the Non-Crimilary Certificate of the financial year of the interview or examination for which this stage of interview is not applicable, such certificate should be considered for the relevant interview or document verification.
