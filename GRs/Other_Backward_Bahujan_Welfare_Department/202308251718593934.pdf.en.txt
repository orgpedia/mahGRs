Introduction: In the state of Maharashtra, there are many castes and tribes in the category of Vimukta Jati Nomadic Tribe and are still living a nomadic life. Although there are many groups of tandas/ hamlets such as Laman, Banjara, Dhangar, Pardhi and people of these castes/ tribes have been living in such tandas for many years, such tandas or hamlets do not have access to basic facilities and are inclined towards modernity, but the majority of the society of this category is living in poverty. The community should lead a stable life in the place where it is currently living in the tandas, wadis or hamlets
For this, they need to be provided with basic facilities. Read it here. The Vasantrao Naik Tanda Habitat Improvement Scheme has been started under the Government Decision of 1.
Also, read this. This scheme is being implemented by amending the Government Decision No. 2. The details of works to be taken up in Tandas/ Wadi/ Bastis under Scheme 3 and 4 are mentioned. However, the internal road works to be taken up under the Vasantrao Naik Tanda/ Vasti Sudhar Yojana are facing problems as the work does not include installation of paver blocks along the CC roads as per local conditions. Also, there was a demand from various levels to include the work of" installing paver blocks" along the CC road in the internal road works.
Government's decision:
Under the Vasantrao Naik Tanda Habitat Improvement Scheme, 1. Electrification (Hymax, Street lights, LED installation), 2. potable water, 3. internal roads, 4. sewers, 5. toilets, 6. Samaj Mandir/ libraries, 7. roads connecting main road wherever possible, 8. construction of Sant Ramrao Maharaj Hall etc. for works.
